We study industry aggregate, state-level, and firm-specific fundraising to determine if macroeconomic, regulatory, or performance factors affect venture capital activity. We find that shifts in demand for venture capital appear to have a positive and important impact on commitments to new venture capital funds. Commitments by taxable and tax-exempt investors seem equally sensitive to changes in capital gains tax rates, consistent with the notion that decreases in capital gains tax rates increase the demand for venture capital as more workers are incented to become entrepreneurs. Aggregate and state level venture fundraising are positively affected by easing of pension investment restrictions as well as industrial and academic R&D expenditures. Fund performance and reputation also lead to greater fundraising by venture organizations.  \n\nPaul A.

Introduction  \n\nDuring the past twenty years, commitments to the U.s. venture capital industry have grown dramatically. This growth has not been uniform: it has occurred in quite concentrated areas of the country and peaks in fundraising have been followed by major retrenchments. Despite the importance of the venture capital sector in generating innovation and new jobs, few academic studies have attempted to determine the underlying causes of these dramatic movements in venture fundraising.  \n\nIn this paper we examine the forces that affect fundraising by independent venture capital organizations from 1972 through 1994. We study both industry fundraising patterns and the fundraising success of individual venture organizations. We find that regulatory changes affecting pension funds, capital gains tax rates, overall economic growth, and research and development expenditures—as  well as firm-specific performance  and  reputation—affect fundraising  by  venture  capital  organizations. The  results  are  potentially  important  for understanding and promoting venture capital investment.  \n\nVarious factors may affect the level of commitments to venture capital organizations. Poterba (1989) argues that many of the changes in fundraising could arise from changes in either the supply of or the demand for venture capital. When we refer to the supply of venture capital, we mean the desire of investors to place money into venture capital funds. Demand is then the desire of entrepreneurs to attract venture capital investment in their firm. For example, decreases in capital gains tax rates might increase commitments to venture capital funds through increases in the desire of taxable investors to make new commitments to funds as well as through increases in the demand for venture capital investments when workers have greater incentives to become entrepreneurs. Our research methodology attempts to distinguish between supply and demand factors that affect the quantity of venture capital.  \n\nWe find that demand-side factors appear to have had an important impact on commitments to venture capital funds. Capital gains tax rates have an important effect at both the industry, state-, and firm-specific levels. Decreases in the capital gains tax rates are associated with greater venture capital commitments. The effect, however, appears to occur through the demand for venture capital: rate changes affect both taxable and tax-exempt investors.  Similarly, R&D expenditures, especially expenditures by industrial firms, are positively related to venture investments in particular states.  \n\nWe also find that The Department of Labor's clarification of its “prudent man\"’ rule, which enabled pension funds to freely invest in venture capital, and individual venture firm performance and reputation influence fundraising. Higher recent returns (as measured by the value of equity held in firms taken public) lead to greater capital commitments to new funds. Older and larger organizations also attract more capital. Finally, we examine factors that affect venture organizations’ decisions to raise funds targeted at early-stage, start-up firms. These funds are potentially the most important for generating new firms and innovation. We find that smaller, West Coast venture organizations are more likely to have raised an early-stage venture fund.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: A brief discussion of the institutional details of venture capital is presented in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the economics of venture capital and presents factors that might affect venture capital fundraising. Industry-wide fundraising patterns, at both the aggregate and state level, are explored in Section 4. Section 5 explores fundraising by individual venture organizations in an exhaustive database of venture capital funds. Section 6 considers alternative explanations. Section 7 concludes.  \n\n## 2. The Institution of Venture Capital  \n\nIn this section we briefly review the institutional details of venture capital organizations. The discussion highlights the structure and function of venture capital organizations in the U.S. and how venture capital is distinct from other sources of financing for young, entrepreneurial companies. In addition, we seek to place the development of the venture capital industry in context so the tests discussed in Section 3 are better understood.  \n\nMany start-up firms require substantial capital. A firm’s founder may not have sufficient funds to finance these projects alone and might therefore seek outside financing. Entrepreneurial firms that are characterized by significant intangible assets, expect years of negative earnings, and have uncertain prospects are unlikely to receive bank loans or other debt financing. For many of these young companies, the tremendous uncertainty and asymmetric information may make venture capital the only potential source of financing. Venture capital organizations finance these high-risk, potentially high-reward projects, purchasing equity stakes while the firms are still privately held. Venture capitalists have backed many high-technology companies including Apple Computer,  \n\nCisco Systems, Genentech, Intel, Microsoft, Netscape, and Sun Microsystems. A substantial number of successful service firms (including Federal Express, Staples, Starbucks, and TCBY) have also received venture financing.  \n\nVenture capitalists are often active investors, monitoring the progress of firms, sitting on boards of directors, and meting out financing based on the attainment of milestones. While banks monitor the financial health of firms that they lend to, venture capitalists monitor strategy and investment decisions as well as take an active role in advising the firm. Venture capitalists often retain important control rights that allow them to intervene in the company's operations when necessary. In addition, venture capitalists provide entrepreneurs with access to consultants, investment bankers, and lawyers. Brav and Gompers (1997) show that venture capital backing adds value even after the initial public offering: venture-backed companies substantially outperform nonventure-backed firms in the public aftermarket.  \n\nThe first modern venture capital firm, American Research and Development (ARD), was formed in 1946 by MIT President Karl Compton, Harvard Business School Professor Georges F. Doriot, and local business leaders. A small group of venture capitalists made high-risk investments into emerging companies that were based on technology developed for World War II. The success of the investments ranged widely: almost half of ARD's profits during its 26-year existence as an independent entity came from its $\\$70,000$ investment in Digital Equipment Company (DEC) in 1957, which grew in value to $\\$355$ million. Because institutional investors were reluctant to invest, ARD was structured as a publicly traded closed-end fund and marketed mostly to individuals [Liles (1977)]. The few other venture organizations begun in the decade after ARD's formation were also structured as closed-end funds.  \n\nThe first venture capital limited partnership, Draper, Gaither, and Anderson, was formed in 1958. Imitators soon followed, but limited partnerships accounted for a minority of the venture pool during the 1960s and 1970s. Most venture organizations raised money either through closed-end funds or small business investment companies (SBICs), federally guaranteed risk-capital pools that proliferated during the 1960s. While the market for SBICs in the late 1960s and early 1970s was strong, incentive problems ultimately led to the collapse of the sector. Even so, the annual flow of money into venture capital during its first three decades never exceeded a few hundred million dollars and usually was substantially less.  \n\nOne change in the venture capital industry during the past twenty years has been the rise of the limited partnership as the dominant organizational form.? Limited partnerships also have an important advantage which makes them attractive to tax-exempt institutional investors: capital gains taxes are not paid by the limited partnership. Instead taxes are paid only by the (taxable) investors. Venture partnerships have pre-determined, finite lifetimes (usually ten years though extensions are often allowed). Investors in the fund are limited partners. In order to maintain limited liability, investors must not become involved in the day-to-day management of the fund.  \n\n## 3. The Economics of Venture Capital  \n\n### 3.1.Supply and demand in venture capital  \n\nIn this section we develop predictions about what factors might influence the quantity of venture capital provided in an economy. In order to understand the mechanism through which these factors work, it is important to discuss supply and demand in the venture capital market. Figure 1 presents a simple illustration of equilibrium in the venture capital market. Supply of venture capital is determined by the willingness of investors to provide funds to venture firms. The willingness of investors to commit money to venture capital is dependent upon the expected rate of return on venture investments. Therefore, in the venture capital market, price is the expected rate of return on new venture capital investments. Higher expected returns lead to a greater desire of investors to supply venture capital, i.e., like most supply schedules it slopes upward.  \n\nThe demand schedule is simply the quantity of entrepreneurial firms seeking venture capital that can supply a particular expected rate of return.  As the price increases—-the expected return increases—fewer entrepreneurial firms demand capital because the quantity of projects meeting that threshold declines. The demand schedule therefore slopes downward.  \n\nWe will discuss the equilibria in the supply and demand framework by examining the quantity of venture capital. While any supply and demand equilibrium also implies a particular price, i.e., an expected rate of return, we can not measure the anticipated rate of return in the venture capital market. Nor does the actual rate of return provide a useful proxy. Returns from venture capital investments can only be observed many years after the original investments because private firms are valued at cost until they are sold or taken public many years later.  \n\nBecause of these accounting policies, the stated returns for venture funds are exceedingly variable and somewhat misleading. [See the discussion in Gompers and Lerner (1997).]?  We feel fairly comfortable that the expected rate of return, i.e., price, will not vary substantially across the sample period. As discussed below, however, supply curves for venture capital are likely to be very elastic. Hence, changes in equilibrium will have a significantly larger effect on quantities than on prices.  \n\nThe supply schedule for venture capital is likely to be quite flat. Investors choose to place money in financial assets because of the monetary returns that they return.  Because close substitutes for these cash flows exist either through a single security or combination of securities, investors will have a particular expected return on venture capital that just compensates for the systematic riskiness of the investments [Scholes (1972)]. If perfect substitutes for venture capital existed, then the supply curve should be totally flat. We draw supply curves as slightly upward sloping in Figure 1. One source of an upward slope would be differential taxes. Because the return on venture capital investments is taxable, investors with higher tax rates would require progressively higher expected rates of return to induce them to invest in venture funds versus some tax-free investment.  \n\n### 3.2. The Employment Retirement Income Security Act and venture commitments  \n\nOne policy decision that potentially had an effect on commitments to venture funds via supply changes is the clarification by the U.S. Department of Labor of the Employment Retirement  \n\nIncome Security Act's (ERISA) prudent man rule in 1979.  Through 1978, the rule stated that pension managers had to invest with the care of a “prudent man.\" Consequently, many pension funds avoided investing in venture capital entirely: it was felt that a fund's investment in a start-up could be seen as imprudent. In early 1979, the Department of Labor ruled that portfolio diversification was a consideration in determining the prudence of an individual investment. Thus, the ruling implied that an allocation of a small fraction of a portfolio to venture capital funds would not be seen as imprudent. That clarification specifically opened the door for pension funds to invest in venture capital.  \n\nWe conjecture that the supply curve for venture capital before the clarification of ERISA might have looked like $\\mathbf{S}_{1}$ . The upward inelastic segment of $S_{1}$ results because pension funds, a segment of the U.s. financial market that controls substantial amounts of capital, were unable to invest in venture funds. The supply of venture capital may have been limited at any expected rate of return. If the initial demand for venture capital were given by $\\mathrm{D}_{1}$ , then the equilibrium quantity of venture capital would be given by $\\mathsf Q_{1}$  \n\nAfter ERISA, the supply curve moved to $\\mathbf{S}_{2}$ . The supply curve moved down and flattened out. The supply curve moved down because pension funds, which are tax exempt, required a lower expected rate of return on venture investments than other taxable investors. The curve would not have an inelastic segment because the resources of pensions could now be invested in venture capital funds. When we look at the data, we expect that the quantity of venture capital supplied will increase after ERISA was clarified to $\\mathrm{Q}_{2}$ . This effect should only be significant for contributions by pension funds because ERISA regulations have no bearing on other types of investors.  \n\n### 3.3. Capital gains taxes and venture capitalfundraising  \n\nThe effect of capital gains tax rates on commitments to the venture capital industry has been debated in the academic literature as well as political circles. The effect of reductions in the capital gains tax rate on commitments to venture capital was one of the intended benefits of the reduction of the tax from $28\\%$ to $14\\%$ on investments in small companies held for five years that was enacted in 1993.  \n\nPoterba (1989) argued that it was unlikely that capital gains taxes affected venture capital by shifting the supply curve. The supply effect of capital gains tax reductions is illustrated by C in Figure 1. A reduction in the capital gains tax rate would lower the required expected (pre-tax) rate of return on venture investments for taxable investors. This would cause the right-hand side of supplycurve $\\mathbf{S}_{2}$ to shift down to $S_{3}$ .Most investors in venture capital after 1980 have been taxexempt institutions and the supply effect may therefore have been small.  \n\nPoterba then develops a model of the decision to become an entrepreneur. He argues that the capital gains tax rate could have a dramatic effect on this choice. Lower capital gains tax rates make it relatively more attractive for a manager or worker to start his or her own company. Most of a manager's compensation comes in the form of salary and cash bonuses which are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. Most of the compensation from being an entrepreneur is in the form of capital appreciation on the equity of the company. Poterba argues that it is possible that reductions in the capital gains tax rates could have a first-order effect on the demand for venture capital as more people are induced to become entrepreneurs and better projects are brought to market.  This would increase the quantity of venture capital demanded to $\\mathrm{D}_{2}$ and increase the equilibrium quantity of venture capital to $\\mathrm{Q}_{3}$  \n\nIf the capital gains tax rate has an important impact on commitments to venture capital funds, then we would expect a significant relation at the industry level and at the fund-specific level. Lower capital gains taxes should lead to increases in commitments to the industry as a whole as well as to individual funds. We can also shed light on whether Poterba's argument about supply and demand effects is valid. If capital gains taxes affect commitments to venture capital primarily through the demand for venture capital, then we expect that reductions in the capital gains tax rate should have a positive impact on the commitments of both tax-exempt and tax-sensitive investors. If the effect is primarily due to supply changes, then contributions by tax-exempt investors should be unrelated to the capital gains tax rate. Because we can separate contributions to venture funds by investor type, we should be able to determine whether the demand effects (B in Figure 1) or supply effects (C in Figure 1) of decreases in the capital gains tax rate are more important.  \n\n### 3.4. Other macroeconomic factors and venture fundraising  \n\nVenture capital fundraising is potentially affected by other macroeconomic factors as well. Commitments could be affected by both the expected return on alternative investments and the general health of the economy. If the economy is growing quickly, then there may be more attractive opportunities for entrepreneurs to start new firms and, hence, increases in the demand for venture capitalists. Formally, the demand curve would shift to the right. The greater investment opportunity set might be associated with greater commitments to the venture capital industry. GDP growth, returns in the stock market, and R&D expenditures would all be potential proxies for demand conditions.  \n\nThe level of interest rates in the economy also could affect the supply of venture capital. An alternative investment to venture capital is bonds. If interest rates rise, then the attractiveness of investing in venture capital funds may decline. This would decrease the willingness of investors to supply venture capital at all prices, i., at ll expected return levels.  \n\n### 3.5. Firm performance and fundraising  \n\nIn this section we develop hypotheses about factors that might affect venture capital fundraising at the firm level. In addition to the market-wide factors discussed above, we look for venture capital firm-specific characteristics that may influence fundraising. First, a substantial body of research examines the relation between past performance and investment.  Allocations by investors across asset classes seem to be driven by, in part, the relative performance of various sectors over the recent past. If there is short-run momentum in returns—as shown by Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1995)this response may be rational.  \n\nThe flow of money into and out of various types of financial institutions in response to performance has been documented extensively of mutual funds. While the early research on mutual funds [Jensen (1968); Ippolito (1989)] indicated that mutual fund managers as a group do not significantly outperform the market, recent work has shown cash flows appear to respond to past performance.  Sirri and Tufano (1998) find that performance relative to peers in the same investment category is an important determinant of new capital commitments to mutual funds. They examine 690 equity mutual funds and rank the funds by their performance relative to funds that have the same investment focus. They find that the top performing funds in any particular investment style have substantial new commitments to their funds in the subsequent year. The relation between performance and commitments, however, is not linear. Funds that perform poorly do not appear to be penalized in the following year. Money does not leave poor performing funds. Sirri and Tufano (1998) find that one exception to these findings is new funds. Money does seem to leave a new fund if it is a poor performer.  \n\nChevalier and Ellison (1997) examine how these patterns affect investment incentive functions. They find that funds which have underperformed their peers in the first part of the year have an incentive to increase the riskiness of their portfolios in order to increase the chances that they will end up near the top of the performance charts. If they bet wrong and fail, they will lose few of their current investors.  \n\nIf the evidence from mutual funds has implications for venture capital, then we would expect that recent performance would be positively related to commitments to new funds. As in Sirri and Tufano's (1998) mutual fund results, reputation of the venture organization may influence the flow of new commitments when it raises a new fund. Several measures of reputation may be important. These include venture organization age and capital under management. Older and larger venture organizations are likely to have more established reputations. They may therefore receive larger capital commitments than similar younger funds.  \n\n## 4. Venture Industry-Wide Results  \n\nWe examine the implications of performance and capital gains tax rates for commitments to venture capital funds by performing two layers of analysis: aggregate flows and commitments to individual funds. The first level of analysis examines the flow of venture capital commitments into the industry. We examine the commitments to new venture capital funds from 1969 through 1994 first aggregating all commitments in the U.S. We then take up an analysis of the level of venture activity on a state-by-state basis.  \n\n### 4.1. Aggregate fundraising results  \n\nData on annual commitments to U.S. venture capital funds come from the consulting firm Venture Economics. This organization has tracked venture fundraising since the 1960s. This database not only records venture capital organizations, but also the names of their individual funds. We have checked the entries in this database against the historical information reported in over 400 venture offering memorandums and partnership agreements, as well as against the fund profiles in the Venture Capital Journal and Private Equity Analyst. [The construction and verification of the database are described in Gompers and Lerner (1998a).] This database is also used in the analysis of individual organizations? fundraising data analyzed in Section 5.  \n\nThis database includes over two thousand venture capital funds, SBICs, and related organizations. It is used in preparation of directories such as their annual volume Venture Capital  \n\nPerformance. It is compiled from information provided by venture capitalists and institutional investors. In examining fundraising behavior, we only look at venture capital limited partnerships. First, these partnerships are the dominant organizational form in the industry, accounting for roughly $80\\%$ of commitments to the venture capital industry in recent years. Furthermore, the actual size of SBICs and corporate venture affiliates is often very difficult the estimate. SBICs have access to matching government funds, often several times greater than the amount contributed by private investors. Corporate programs usually do not have a pool of capital specified in advance and are frequently disbanded before being investing much capital. Limited partnerships—-with their well-defined size and life-span—-offer the cleanest estimate of venture capital inflows.  \n\nWe total commitments to venture funds each year. Commitments are defined as the pledges that venture capitalists receive for investment over the lifetime of the fund. They are not the amount of money that is actually invested in a given year. Typically, venture funds draw on and invest the committed capital over a two to three year time period. For example, in 1995 Sierra Ventures raised their fifth fund with aggregate commitments of $\\$100$ million. This $\\$100$ million would be invested between 1995 and about 1999, but we would classify the entire $\\$100$ million as having been committed in 1995.  \n\nWe also need some measure of returns in the venture capital industry. Ideally, we would have year-by-year performance data for individual funds. These data present several problems. As discussed above, calculation of returns is hampered by policies of many venture organizations that potentially delay the write-up or write-down of assets. As a proxy for performance of the venture organizations, we use a measure of the market value of equity held by venture capitalists in firms that went public in a particular year. This measure will be highly correlated with returns on venture funds. Most money in venture capital is earned on firms that eventually go public. Ignoring the companies that do not go public is reasonable because their impact on returns is usually quite small. A Venture Economics study (1988) finds that a $\\$1$ investment in a firm that goes public provides an average cash return of $\\$1.95$ in excess of the initial investment with an average holding period of 4.2 years. The next best alternative, an investment in an acquired firm, yields a cash return of only 40 cents over a 3.7 year mean holding period. Using the IPO measure also makes sense because marketing documents for venture capital funds often highlight the successful public companies which have been backed by the venture organization. We therefore expect that the amount of venture capital raised will be a positive function of the value of firms taken public by venture capitalists in the previous year.  \n\nWe identify potential venture-backed IPOs using three sources. The first is the listings of venture-backed IPOs published in Venture Economics' Venture Capital Journal. This is the same source used by Barry, et al. (1990) and Megginson and Weiss (1991). We also use listings of the securities distributions by venture funds.  Venture capitalists typically unwind their successful investments by distributing the shares to their limited partners. They avoid selling the shares themselves and distributing the proceeds to their limited partners because their investors include both tax-exempt and tax-paying parties. To sell the shares would generate an immediate tax liability, which some of the limited partners may wish to avoid. We obtain lists of the distributions received by a pension fund which is among the largest venture investors and by three investment managers [Gompers and Lerner (1998b)]. (These investment managers allocate funds from numerous pension funds into venture capital and other asset classes.)） These investors had received distributions from 135 venture funds, most of which are managed by the oldest and most established venture organizations in the industry. Most of the successful investments by these funds can be identified from these lists.  \n\nThe final source used to identify IPOs for the sample are the offering documents used by venture capitalists to raise new funds from investors. Venture organizations will often list in these offering memorandums their past investments that either went public or were acquired on favorable terms. We examine over four hundred of these memorandums in the files of Venture Economics [Gompers and Lerner (1998a)]. We identify any investments listed as having gone public. Most of the offering documents compiled by Venture Economics are from young venture organizations.  This is because their Fund Raiser Advisory Service counsels less experienced firms on strategies for raising capital.  \n\nWe include in the IPO sample all firms if a venture investor listed in the \"Management\" and \"Principal and Selling Shareholders\" sections of the IPO prospectus is listed in the Venture Economics database. In many cases, it is not immediately obvious whether a venture investor or director is an exact match with a venture organization listed in the database.?  To address these ambiguities, we consult the edition of Venture Economics' Pratt's Guide to Venture Capital Sources (1996) published in the year of the IPO. We compare the addresses and key personnel of each of these ambiguous venture organizations with the information reported in the prospectus. If we are not virtually certain that the venture organizations in the prospectus and the database are the same, we do not code it as a match. For each investor, we code the venture organization, the particular venture fund investing in the firm, and the size of the stake before and after the offering. This process leads to the identification of 885 IPOs in which a venture capitalist served as a director or a venture capital fund was a blockholder.  \n\nIn each year, we calculate the market value of the equity stakes in firms going public held by each venture capital organization. This value is the number of shares held by the venture organization multiplied by the IPO offering price. We then sum the market values for each IPO in a given year to obtain an annual performance number for each venture capital organization. We then sum across all venture organizations in a given year to get a measure of venture industry performance.  \n\nIn Figure 2, we graph the time series of venture capital commitments and the market value of all firms brought public by venture capitalists in each year from 1969 through 1994. We see that from 1969 through 1979, commitments to venture capital and venture-backed IPOs were quite low. Starting in 1980, both commitments to the venture capital industry and the value of firms brought public by venture capitalist rise. The rise of both reversed in 1983. After 1983, it appears that the shift in venture-backed IPO market leads to changes in commitments to new venture funds. For example, increases in the market value of venture-backed IPOs in both 1986 and 1991-1992 preceded resurgences in the venture capital market.  \n\nThe relation between capital gains taxes and venture capital commitments is documented in Figure 3. The relation is clearly negative. In the 1970s, high capital gains tax rates were associated with low levels of venture capital fundraising. Increases in the capital gains tax rates in 1988 were followed by reductions in venture capital commitments, while the reduction of capital gains for long-held investments in 1993 was followed by a rise in venture fundraising. This negative relation between venture capital funding levels and capital gains tax rates is clearly only suggestive, because the influence of multiple factors needs to be examined.  \n\nDetailed information on the nature of commitments is shown in Table 1. Several patterns are prominent. First, the volatility of commitments is readily apparent. The level of fundraising (expressed in 1994 dollars) can vary dramatically from one year to the next. The volatility in venture fundraising is mirrored by a similar volatility in the IPO market, both for venture-backed companies and for the entire IPO market. We see the dramatic shift from individuals to pension funds over the past fifteen years as the primary capital source for new venture funds.?  \n\nIn order to assess the impact of each of these variables controlling for the others, we present multivariate regressions in Table 2. Our approach here and in the individual firm regressions is to estimate reduced-form specifications and identify which factors potentially work through demand shifts and which factors work through supply shifts. The time series of data runs from 1972 through 1994. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of real commitments to the venture capital industry (in millions of 1994 dollars). We present regressions for commitments to the entire venture capital industry, as well as four subgroups: taxable investors, tax-exempt investors, individuals, and pension funds. The independent variables include the natural logarithm of the market value of firms brought public by venture organizations in the previous year (in millions of 1994 dollars), the real return on Treasury bills in the previous year, the real CRSP value-weighted stock market return in the prior year, the previous year's real GDP growth, a dummy variable that equals one for years after 1978 when ERISA's prudent man rule was clarified, and the top marginal capital gains tax rate.  \n\nChanges in ERISA's prudent man rule are associated with greater commitments to the venture capital industry, but the effect is not significant for commitments by taxable investors and individuals. As expected, the strongest effect of ERISA's clarification is on contributions by pension funds. An F-test of the null hypothesis that the coefficient for pension funds is significantly different from the coefficient for individuals and taxable investors shows that ERISA's effect on contributions by pension funds is different at the five percent level. This is consistent with a supply side effect: the easing of pension fund restrictions increased the number of investors wishing to invest in venture capital funds.  \n\nIncreases in capital gains tax rates have a consistently negative effect on contributions to the venture industry, although the effect is only significant for contributions to the entire industry and contributions by pension funds.? While we do find an effect of capital gains taxes on venture capital commitments, it does not appear to be working through the supply side. If changes in the capital gains tax rates had a first-order effect on investors’ willingness to invest in venture capital, then the effect would be strongest for individuals and taxable parties. The opposite is true. As Poterba (1989) suggests, the effect of changes in the capital gains tax rate is likely to come through changes in the demand for venture capital. More and better quality managers are incented to become entrepreneurs when the capital gains tax rate declines and thus the demand for venture capital increases. This increase in demand leads to a greater quantity of venture capital being supplied in equilibrium.  \n\nOnce other factors are included, the value of firms taken public by venture organizations in the previous year does not appear to have a dramatic effect on contributions. While we cannot rule out a role for IPOs creating liquidity in the venture sector and potentially affecting contributions, we cannot find an effect in the multivariate regressions. This finding is contrary to the arguments of Black and Gilson (1998), who emphasize the importance of a vibrant public market in the development of a venture capital industry. It is consistent, however, with the experience of Israel and Singapore, whose venture industries have experienced dramatic growth without having strong domestic public equity markets.  \n\nOf the macroeconomic variables, only real GDP growth is important. Increases in the real rate of growth lead to greater commitments to venture funds. Once again, this suggests that increasing demand for venture capital is an important determinant of the quantity. Robust economic growth creates new opportunities for entrepreneurs and increases demand for such capital.  \n\nOne concern may be that because we are using time series observations on venture fundraising and the independent variables, the results may be affected by serial correlation in the error terms. The Durbin-Watson statistics for each of the regressions were between 1.88 and 2.00, indicating that such serial correlation does not affect the results. As a diagnostic, we also ran Cochrane-Orcutt regressions using a lag term which did not materially change the results.  \n\n### 4.2. State-level venture activity  \n\nOne difficulty with the analysis in the previous section was the relatively small number of observations. In order to gain additional power for our tests of market-wide venture activity, we examine venture capital activity in each of the fifty states and the District of Columbia from 1976 through 1994. We can then examine how state level demand and supply factors affect venture investing in those states.  \n\nWe employ a slightly different approach here than in Sections 4.1 and 5: rather than examining the formation of venture funds in each state, we measure the actual venture capital investments. This reflects the difficulty of assigning venture organizations to particular states. Many venture organizations have multiple offices, which may account for differing shares of the investments. Venture organizations headquarters may reflect the need to be proximate to their sources of capital and not their portfolio firms. For instance, many venture organizations are based in New York City, even though this has historically been the site of few start-up firms. This pattern is particularly true for groups specializing in the later-stage investments, which typically occur after other groups (who may be geographically more proximate to the portfolio firm) have already joined the board [Lerner (1995)].  \n\nWe once again use the data of Venture Economics to determine venture capital activity by state. In this case, we undertake a special tabulation of the number of companies financed and dollar volume of financing in each state and year between 1976 and 1994. We include all investments by private equity groups into young entrepreneurial firms, but exclude investments into leveraged buyouts and restructurings by groups that primarily make venture capital investments.  \n\nWe also collect a variety of additional data on a state by state basis. Gross state product has been compiled on an annual basis by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (1997) [also used was Friedenberg and Beemiller, (1997)]. For each state, we compiled the total amount of research performed in industry and in academia, regardless of funding source. The state industrial R&D data was compiled by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as part of the “Survey of Research and Development in Industry” (1980, 1998b). The data posed two problems. First, since 1978 this information has only been collected on a biannual basis. Thus, it was necessary to impute the missing years. Second, certain states are persistently missing. In these instances, the unassigned R&D in each region is assigned to each suppressed state on the basis of its Gross State Product.& The allocation of academic R&D expenditures by state is determined the NSF's annual “Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges\" (1998a). We obtain the marginal state tax rate on capital gains through the use of the TAXSIM tax simulation program. We compute the impact of $\\$1000$ Of capital gains on a wealthy individual in each state and year, controlling for the possible deductibility of state taxes in Federal taxes. [The program is described in Feenberg and Coutts (1993); the simulation and the resulting data are reproduced at http://www.nber.org/-taxsim/state-rates.]  \n\nTable 3 looks at venture capital activity in each state by tabulating the total number of companies that received venture capital and the total amount of venture capital invested from 1976 through 1994. The tremendous concentration of investment in four states is clearly evident. California has by far the most venture investing activity with nearly $\\$20$ billion invested (in 1994 dollars). Massachusetts, New York, and Texas are the next most active states and account for the bulk of the remaining capital. It is also clear that many states have almost no venture capital activity. We seek to explore these patterns in a regression framework.  \n\nIn Table 4 we present state fixed-effects regressions for the level of venture capital investment per capita (in millions of 1994 dollars) and the number of companies receiving venture capital per capita. We employ an observation for each year in each state, i.e., a balanced panel. Independent variables include market-wide measures used in the regressions in Table 2 (logarithm of IPO activity, the previous year's real T-bill return, and the previous year's equity market return). In addition, we include several variables that might proxy for state-level demand conditions. These include the previous year's growth in state Gross State Product (GSP) per capita as well as measures of last year's academic and industrial expenditure on R&D (in millions of 1994 dollars) per capita. The R&D expenditure potentially captures demand effects of high-technology firms. If R&D is higher in a state, it may mean that the number of potential entrepreneurs with promising ideas may be greater.  \n\nIn addition, we include a dummy variable that is equal to one after 1978 to capture the effect of changes in ERISA's prudent man rule. Finally, we include several measures of the capital gains tax rate burden. We first control for state and Federal capital gains taxes separately by including the maximum marginal state and Federal capital gains tax rate separately. We then add the Federal and state rates to create a variable which captures the total capital gains tax burden in that state.?  \n\nTable 4 shows that both industrial and academic R&D spending are significantly related to state-level venture capital activity. Increases in state R&D levels increase both the amount of venture capital invested as well as the number of firms receiving venture capital. This result suggests that both academic and industrial R&D spending are potentially important for the creation of entrepreneurial firms that demand venture capital.  \n\nSimilarly, growth in GSP per capita is positively related to venture capital activity. This result, consistent with the aggregate results, may indicate the importance of the demand effects, i.. it is important to have a strong growing economy to create new firms that need venture capital financing.  \n\nThe dummy variable measuring the shift in ERISA policy continues to have a positive effect in the state-level regressions. After the clarification of ERISA, the amount of venture capital invested per capita as well as the number of firms receiving venture capital per capita increases. Finally, capital gains tax rates continue to matter. In the regressions including both state and Federal rates, it is only the Federal rate that is significantly related to venture capital activity. The state capital gains tax rate is, however, always negatively related to venture capital activity and is of the same order of magnitude as the effect of Federal rates. The combined Federal and state capital gains rate is also significantly related to venture capital activity. The result confirms the earlier results. Capital gains tax rates do appear to be negatively related to venture capital activity.  \n\n## 5. Individual venture organization results  \n\n### 5.1. Summary statistics  \n\nIn this section, we examine fundraising patterns by individual venture organizations. We perform three levels of analysis. First, we present summary statistics for the database, both in its entirety and segmented by year. We then analyze factors affecting the fundraising ability of individual venture organizations. Finally, we examine the decision of venture organizations to raise funds with a focus on early- and seed-stage firms. The importance of early- and seed-stage funds in creating new firms is widely recognized. Many of the efforts to stimulate venture activity focus on stimulating seed capital funds. Understanding the unique factors affecting the decision to target these firms is important for potential policy decisions. We examine fund information collected by Venture Economics from 1961 through 1992.  \n\nTable 5 presents information on the completeness of the venture fundraising database. In all, we have information on 1294 venture capital funds. Of those, we have information on the fund size and closing date for 846 (20 of these are missing month of closing). The average venture organization in the sample raised 2.23 funds while the median raised only 1. The maximum number of venture funds raised by an organization is 25. The average venture organization raised $\\$126$ million in 1994 dollars while the largest organization had raised over $\\$2$ billion.  \n\nThe time series distribution of our sample is presented in Table 6. We see growth in both the number of funds raised and dollar volume of commitments in the early- and mid-1980s. The sample also appears to exhibit a slight growth in the size of funds raised (in constant 1994 dollars). If we look at the sum of all the funds in our sample, we have data on $\\$45.0$ billion in venture funding which represents nearly all the capital raised by organized venture capital partnerships during the sample period.1° The lack of size data for 448 of the funds does not impart bias to our results. Our data cover almost all the capital raised over the sample period and, hence, the results are clearly applicable to the most important firms.  \n\n### 5.2.Fundraising regression results  \n\nWe analyze firm level fundraising by using one yearly observation for each venture organization starting with the year that they raise their first venture capital fund. The dependent variable is either a dummy variable indicating whether the venture organization raised a fund or the amount of money (in millions of 1994 dollars) raised in that year. Independent variables include the age of the venture organization, the amount of money it raised during the previous ten years\" (in millions of 1994 dollars), the value of equity held by this venture organization in firms brought public in that year and the previous year, the value of all venture-backed firms brought public in the previous year, real GDP growth in the previous year, the previous year's Treasury bill return, the previous year's stock market return as measured by the annual return on the CRSP value weighted market index, a dummy variable that equals one after 1978 (indicating years after the clarification of the ERISA prudent man rule), and the top marginal capital gains tax rate on individuals.  \n\nWe estimate a Heckman two-stage model. The Heckman model estimates two equations. The first is the probability that a fund was raised in a given year. The second equation then estimates the amount raised given that a fund was raised in a particular year. This two-stage model is appropriate if the correct decision is that venture capitalists first decide whether to raise a new fund or not. Once they decide to raise a new fund, the venture capitalists then decide the size of fund they wish to raise. The two equations give us insights about factors that affect the probability of raising a new fund and ones that primarily affect the optimal fund size.  \n\nTable 7 gives the results from the Heckman models. The first regression in each model gives the probability of raising a new fund, while the second regression gives the size of a fund conditional on it being raised. We find that neither the capital gains tax rate nor ERISA's clarification have a significant effect on the probability of a venture organization raising a new fund. The ERISA dummy has no effect on the size of the fund either. The capital gains tax rate does, however, have a significant effect on the size of the fund raised. Lower capital gains tax rates are associated with larger funds. This would be expected if venture organizations raised new funds on a normal cycle that was typically unaffected by external factors. Changes in the capital gains tax rate may affect the quantity of good start-ups to finance as managers are induced to start firms. The greater quantity of good projects would lead venture capitalists to raise larger funds.  \n\nWe also find that firm performance has a dramatic effect on fundraising. Both the value of equity held in firms taken public by the venture capital firm in the current year and in the previous year have a positive effect on the probability of raising a new fund and the size of the fund. The effect of the previous year's IPO volume is nearly four times as large as the current year's. This might be due to the long process of raising a new fund (which may take many months). Venture organizations go on “road shows\"’ and gauge investor interest, sign up prospective investors, and generate the necessary documents prior to closing. The more relevant performance is probably the previous year's returns, which are foremost in investors’ minds during fundraising.  \n\nReputation also appears to have a positive effect on the size of the fund raised. Older and larger venture organizations have higher probabilities of raising funds and raise larger funds. The reputation variable potentially captures beliefs about future returns not captured in recent performance variables. The effect of venture organization size is particularly strong on the size of the fund raised. This could indicate that venture organization size is a good proxy for reputation. Venture organization size might also measure the need to raise larger funds. Large venture organizations may have more employees and general partners. In order to keep all of them working at capacity, the minimum fund size needed is substantially higher.  \n\nWe find that the Treasury bill return in the previous year is positively related to the probability of raising a new fund. This effect may stem from the rapid increase in funds being raised in the early 1980s at a time when real interest rates were high. Both the probability of raising a fund and the size of a new fund raised first decline and then increase with time from the previous fund. 12  \n\nWe present the fixed-effects regression models in Table 8. The fixed-effects models include dummy variables for each venture organization that are intended to pick up unmeasured firm-specific factors. If we find a result even after controlling for firm fixed effects, we can be confident that the effects are robust. We could not estimate the fixed-effects Heckman model. Therefore, we run two separate regressions. The first is a fixed-effects logit which estimates the probability of raising a fund in a given year. The second regression is a fixed-effects least squares regression that estimates the size of funds raised conditional on a fund being raised. The approximation to the two-stage maximum likelihood Heckman model is consistent in the estimations without the fixed effects, so we are confident that the results in Table 8 are reasonable [Maddala (1987)].  \n\nIn both specifications, the capital gains tax rate continues to be a significant factor in venture fundraising. A decrease in the capital gains tax rate increases the size of funds raised in all the specifications. In the first model, the ERISA dummy variable has an important impact. Controlling for firm factors, the ERISA clarification leads to a greater probability of raising a new fund.  \n\nVenture organization performance (as measured by the value of equity stakes in initial public offerings) continues to have a positive effect on fundraising. In the two-stage model with firm fixed effects, the probability of raising a fund increases with greater performance, but the size of the fund does not appear to be affected. We find, however, that the reputation variables have mixed signs in the fixed-effects regression, which are different from the regressions without the firm fixed effects. In the two-stage model, the probability of raising a fund is lower for older and larger organizations, but the fund size is larger. As a firm ages, the probability of raising a new fund declines, although the size of funds being raised increases. This lower probability of raising a fund may reflect the retirement of partners within older venture organizations. Unconditionally, older firms are more likely to raise a fund because of their better track record. Controlling for firm effects, however, as a firm ages, it becomes less likely to raise a fund.  \n\n### 5.3.Stage focus results  \n\nWe also undertake an analysis of the ability of venture capital organizations to raise a fund that focuses on early-stage investments. The early-stage venture market is often seen as being critical to the success of later-stage investments. Early-stage funds provide new firms with critical financing in their infancy [see for instance OECD (1996)]. Many of the policy initiatives undertaken across the country and around the world are aimed at increasing the availability of early-stage capital. Similarly, firms in their very early stages are the most prone to capital rationing and liquidity constraints because the uncertainty and asymmetric information are the greatest. If we can understand the incentives to raise a focused fund, we might be able to understand industry dynamics better and may make better recommendations about promoting new entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nWe divide firms into two categories in this analysis. We indicate whether the funds analyzed above have a stated investment focus on early-stage firms only. (Venture Economics characterizes each fund's focus in their database.) Table 9 presents summary statistics for venture funds that have a stated early-stage focus and those that do not. We find that funds focusing on early-stage investments are significantly smaller, with a mean [median] size of $\\$42$ $[\\$25]$ million, than are funds that do not focus on early-stage investments (mean of $\\$57$ million). This makes sense because early-stage investments are typically smaller than later-stage investments. Gompers (1995) finds that the average early-stage investment is only half as large as the mean later-stage investment. Because the amount of time spent during the investment and monitoring process (e.g., due diligence, negotiations, etc.) and the need for oversight after the investment is similar, early-stage funds are usually smaller.  \n\nWe also find that early-stage funds tend to be raised by venture organizations that are slightly older and larger. One possibility is that older, more experienced venture organizations have the necessary knowledge to raise a focused fund. The early-stage funds are, on average, more recent and are more likely to be raised on the West Coast. Clearly, the mix of investments on the West Coast, primarily California, is heavily concentrated on early-stage, technology-based companies. East Coast firms are more balanced and tend to invest in greater fractions of laterstage companies.  \n\nIn Table 10 we present multivariate regressions analyzing the determinants of fund focus. We use each new venture capital fund as an observation and examine whether it had an earlystage focus. As the summary statistics hinted, smaller funds are more likely to have an earlystage focus. Similarly, we find that firms on the West Coast are more likely to raise an earlystage fund. Finally, we find that a venture organization is more likely to raise a fund with an early-stage focus after the Department of Labor's clarification of ERISA's prudent man rule. This greater probability following ERISA change is potentially due to the clarification stating that investments would be judged prudent not by their individual risk, but by their contribution to portfolio risk.  Prior to this amendment, early-stage funds may have been viewed as too speculative and may have had a more difficult time raising money than a later-stage or general purpose venture capital fund. After the amendment, venture organizations could raise focused funds without worrying that pension funds would avoid it out of concern over its perceived riskiness.  \n\n## 6. Alternative Explanations  \n\nSeveral alternative explanations may account for the findings in Sections 4 and 5. First, the supply and demand for venture capital may be affected by the supply of substitute financing. We have attempted to control for the cost of credit by including the real interest rate. In periods of high real interest rates, venture capital may be more attractive from the entrepreneur's perspective. Similarly, if the availability of bank financing were a major factor in the determination of venture capital commitments, then we should have seen an increase in venture capital commitments in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when bank credit to young, small firms substantially declined. Instead, we see a decline in venture capital commitments over this time period, indicating that bank credit and venture fundraising moved together.  \n\nA second alternative explanation for our results on capital gains taxes and venture commitments may be the inability to accurately measure expected GDP growth. If expected GDP growth is somehow correlated with capital gains tax rates, then we might be incorrectly interpreting the significance to capital gains tax rates. In unreported regressions, we modeled expected GDP growth using the previous four years of real GDP growth. Instead of lagged GDP growth, we reestimated the regressions using the expected GDP growth rate. Results were qualitatively the same as in Sections 4 and 5. This is not surprising since the expected GDP growth rate is primarily affected by last year's growth.  \n\nFinally, the growth in venture capital commitments may have less to do with policy changes and more to do with changes in the amount of technological opportunities. In fact, the state level R&D expenditures indicate that this may be the case. If changes in technological opportunity were causing increases in venture capital investments, we would expect several measures of technological innovation to lead increases in venture fundraising. In particular, Kortum and Lerner (1998) show that a surge of patents 0ccurred in the late 1980s and 1990s. This suggests that some of the recent growth in venture capital fundraising in the mid-1990s may be due to increases in technological opportunities. The increase in venture fundraising in the late 1970s and 1980s (the period of our sample), however, does not seem to be caused by similar technology shifts. Similarly, the state level analysis shows that even controlling for R&D spending, regulatory policies still have an effect.  \n\n## 7. Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper, we examine the determinants of fundraising for the venture industry and individual venture organizations.  We examine supply and demand effects as well as the importance of individual firm performance and reputation.  \n\nWe find that demand for venture capital appears to play a critical role. Higher GDP growth and increases in R&D spending lead to greater venture capital activity. We also find that capital gains tax rates matter, with lower rates leading to a greater quantity of venture capital raised. The effect, however, appears to stem from a greater demand for venture capital: commitments by tax-exempt pension funds are the most affected by changes in the capital gains tax rate. We find evidence that ERISA clarification in rules governing pension fund investment have generally increased commitments to the industry.  \n\nFund performance is an important determinant of the ability of venture organizations to raise new capital. Firms that hold larger equity stakes in firms that have recently gone public raise funds with greater probability and raise larger funds. Reputation, in the form of firm age and size, also positively impacts the ability to raise new capital.  \n\nWe also provide evidence that the decision to raise an early-stage venture fund has been affected by pension regulations. The probability of raising a focused fund increased after  \n\nERISA's clarification. We also find greater early-stage activity in smaller funds and venture organizations on the West Coast where technology-based startups are more prevalent.  \n\nOur research has a variety of implications for policy makers who wish to stimulate venture capital activity. The fundraising results indicate that regulatory reform and policy decisions may have an effect on commitments to the venture industry. While the capital gains tax rate is an important driver of venture capital fundraising, blanket reduction in capital gains tax rates may be a blunt instrument for promoting venture capital. Our analysis suggests that an important factor for the increase in venture capital is probably increases in the number of high quality startups. The greater number of good firms leads to more demand for venture capital. Policies that increase the relative attractiveness of becoming an entrepreneur and promote technology innovation probably would have more of an effect on venture capital investments than an across the board cut in the capital gains tax rate. Furthermore, the results highlight the highly localized nature of venture capital activity. Countries that wish to promote venture capital activity may consider concentrating efforts rather than spreading resources uniformly around the country. This is in contrast to many of the efforts that various countries have instituted.  \n\nThe results also raise a series of questions for further research. In general, the role of reputation and performance as determinants of fundraising is consistent with earlier literature for other types of money managers. The decision to invest is clearly predicated on the expectation of future returns, and both past performance and reputation are components of the expected future returns. But in recent years, many of the most established venture organizations in the U.S. have experienced internal corporate governance problems and have been disbanded. The issue of who carries the reputation with them is important. Does reputation follow general partners who start their own fund or must they establish new reputations? In markets without experienced venture capitalists, how can the lack of reputation be overcome? Clearly, more work is necessary.  \n\nAnother set of unanswered questions relates to the effectiveness of public efforts to transfer the venture capital model to other regions. Even if venture capital organizations spur technological innovation in the United States, it is not evident that the model can be seamlessly transferred abroad. Different employment practices, regulatory policies, or public market avenues might limit the formation these funds [see Black and Gilson (1998) for a discussion]. Even if it were feasible to transfer such efforts, public economic development programs can be subject to political manipulation: e.g, pressures to award funds to politically connected businesses.  \n\nOn the other hand, overseas venture initiatives may be able to benefit from the experience of venture organizations in the United States. In particular, the Israeli Yozma program seems to have successfully captured “spillovers\"’ of knowledge from U.S. and British venture organizations. In contrast to many forms of government intervention to boost economic growth, the implementation of these programs has received little scrutiny by economists. [Two recent exceptions are Irwin and Klenow (1996) and Lerner (1996).] This is a ripe area for further exploration.  \n\nVenture capital is increasingly regarded as an important component of the U.S. economic landscape. While policy makers have often tried to affect the flow of funds into the sector, little has been known about the real impact of such policy measures. Our paper begins to answer those questions and points towards areas for future research.  \n\nReferences Anand, Bharat. 1996. “Tax Effects on Venture Capital\" Unpublished working paper, Yale School of Management.

Wells  \n\nBoston Uniersity Schoolof Management, Boston,MA,UA b Bain Capital, USA  \n\n# Abstract  \n\nThis paper analyses the determinants of venture capital for a sample of 21 countries. In particular, we consider the importance of initial public offerings (IPOs), gross domestic product (GDP) and market capitalization growth, labor market rigidities, accounting standards, private pension funds, and government programs. We find that IPOs are the strongest driver of venture capital investing. Private pension fund levels are a significant determinant over time but not across countries. Surprisingly, GDP and market capitalization growth are not significant. Government policies can have a strong impact, both by setting the regulatory stage, and by galvanizing investment during downturns. Finally, we also show that different types of venture capital financing are affected differently by these factors. In particular, early stage venture capital investing is negatively impacted by labor market rigidities, while later stage is not. IPOs have no effect on early stage venture capital investing across countries, but are a significant determinant of later stage venture capital investing across countries. Finally, government funded venture capital has different sensitivities to the determinants of venture capital than non-government funded venture capital. Our insights emphasize the need for a more differentiated approach to venture capital, both from a research as well as from a policy perspective. We feel that while later stage venture capital investing is well understood, early stage and government funded investments still require more extensive research. $\\copyright$ 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction  \n\nVenture capital has been the driving force behind some of the most vibrant sectors of the US economy over the past two decades. Venture capitalists were instrumental in fostering the tremendous growth of firms such as Microsoft, Compaq, Oracle, and Sun Microsystems, which were all founded less than 20 years ago, but have rapidly become dominant players in the high technology arena. While the contributions venture capital makes to the economy overall are underexplored, there exists a widespread belief that venture capital is instrumental in bringing innovations to market at a rapid pace, thereby creating economic growth, jobs, and opportunities for further technological innovation. The 1997 National Venture Capital Association annual study on the impact of venture capital sheds light on some of the job-creating abilities of the sector. The study reveals that between 1991 and 1995, venture-backed companies increased their staffs on average $34\\%$ per year. Over the same time period, Fortune 500 companies decreased staffing levels $4\\%$ per year.  \n\nThe growth rate of venture capital funding has been high in many countries, but funding levels still vary significantly (see Table 1). In this paper, our goal is to understand the determinants of growth in the venture capital industry. Our work builds on that of Black and Gilson (1998), who examine the importance of well-developed stock markets and initial public offerings (IPOs) for venture capital financing. Black and Gilson's empirical work tests only the significance of IPOs over time in the US. We test a number of other factors in addition to IPOs, and use panel data for 10 years and 15 countries. The factors we test are the ones enumerated in the literature on venture capital: IPOs, gross domestic product (GDP) and market capitalization growth, labor market rigidities, financial reporting standards, private pension funds, and government programs.  \n\nOur results indicate that IPOs are the most important determinant of venture capital investing. Private pension fund levels impact venture capital over time, but not across countries. Our analysis demonstrates the necessity of separating venture capital into early (seed and startup) and later (expansion) stage investing, both for the purposes of analysis and for policy considerations. In particular, we show that different types of venture capital are differently affected by the determinants of venture capital. Thus, labor market rigidities negatively affect early stage venture capital investments, but have no impact on later stage venture capital investments. IPOs have no impact on early stage investments across countries, but are a significant determinant for later stage venture capital investments. Government funded venture capital is not as strongly determined by IPOs as non-government funded venture capital. Finally, our qualitative analysis of government programs gives further insight into the role government funds can play as a catalyst for private sector funding.  \n\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the role of small firms in the economy and the link between these firms and venture capital from the perspectives of financial intermediation, corporate governance, and entrepreneurship. Section 3 explains how venture capital firms are organized and how they work. Section 4 surveys the theories that explain what factors affect venture capital investments. Section 5 discusses the data, while Section 6 covers the regression methodology. Section 7 presents our empirical results. Section 8 discusses the role of government programs and includes case studies of the venture capital experience of Israel and Germany. Section 9 concludes.  \n\n# 2. The role of venture capital in the economy  \n\nBefore we discuss venture capital in more detail, we first need to clarify our use of the term, since it is defined differently in the US and Europe. Venture capital, as we use the term, refers to one type of private equity investing. Private equity investments are investments by institutions or wealthy individuals in both publicly quoted and privately held companies. Private equity investors are more actively involved in managing their portfolio companies than regular, passive retail investors. The main types of financing included in private equity investing are venture capital and management and leveraged buyouts. Outside of the US, the term venture capital is frequently used to describe what we have just referred to as privateequity.  \n\nThe definition of venture capital, as it is used in the US, and as we use it in our paper, comprises three types of investing — seed, startup, and expansion investment — and excludes buyouts. These types represent three stages of investing which are defined with reference to the stage of development of the company receiving the investment.  \n\nSeed capital is the very first type of financing a newly founded company might want to secure. These funds are typically used to fund initial product research and development and to assess the commercial potential of ideas. Startup investments, on the other hand, are targeted at companies that have moved past the idea stage and are gearing up to produce, market, and sell their products. Companies at this stage still use more cash than they generate. Investments in either seed or startup stage are also referred to simply as early stage investments.  \n\nAfter a company has passed through the early stage, it becomes a potential candidate for expansion stage investing. In the expansion stage, a company that has already established its product in the marketplace often needs additional capital to fund the growth of its manufacturing and distribution capacity, as well as to fund further R & D.  \n\nTable 1 Country comparison   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Countries</td><td colspan=\"3\">Venture capital (US$ in millions)</td><td colspan=\"3\">Early stage (US$ in millions)</td><td colspan=\"3\">Private equity new funds (US$ in millions)</td></tr><tr><td>1986a</td><td>1995b</td><td>CAGR%</td><td>1986a</td><td>1995b</td><td>CAGR%</td><td>1986c</td><td>1995d</td><td>CAGR%</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>417</td><td>888</td><td>45.9</td><td>17</td><td>54</td><td>76.5</td><td>239</td><td>249</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td>1.9</td><td>1.4</td><td>-3.8</td><td>2</td><td>0.4</td><td>-16.5</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>195</td><td>139</td><td>-3.7</td><td>67</td><td>8.4</td><td>-20.7</td><td>344</td><td>210</td><td>-5.4</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>152</td><td>412</td><td>15.4</td><td>65</td><td>182</td><td>15.7</td><td>230</td><td>1,133</td><td>19.4</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>22</td><td>19</td><td>-1.6</td><td>4.6</td><td>4.5</td><td>-0.2</td><td>32</td><td>37</td><td>1.7</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>9.7</td><td>38</td><td>21.7</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.0</td><td>32.4</td><td>54</td><td>69</td><td>3.4</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>195</td><td>444</td><td>9.6</td><td>32</td><td>35</td><td>1.2</td><td>168</td><td>1055</td><td>22.6</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>43</td><td>694</td><td>36.4</td><td>9</td><td>116</td><td>32.8</td><td>50</td><td>274</td><td>20.9</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>17</td><td>25</td><td>4.7</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>-18.9</td><td>34</td><td>16</td><td>-7.9</td></tr><tr><td>Israel</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>60</td><td>139</td><td>18.0</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>21</td><td>246</td><td>31.5</td><td>11</td><td>60</td><td>20.9</td><td>203</td><td>354</td><td>6.4</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>2351</td><td>2524</td><td>7.4</td><td>18</td><td>11</td><td>-38.3</td><td>258</td><td>604</td><td>23.7</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>128</td><td>471</td><td>15.6</td><td>31</td><td>100</td><td>14.0</td><td>260</td><td>337</td><td>2.9</td></tr><tr><td>NewZealand</td><td>0.7</td><td>3.8</td><td>461.9</td><td>NA</td><td>0.9</td><td>NM</td><td>14</td><td>33</td><td>135</td></tr><tr><td>Norway</td><td>14</td><td>154</td><td>40.9</td><td>1.2</td><td>7</td><td>28.6</td><td>14</td><td>60</td><td>22.8</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>0.3</td><td>57</td><td>101.1</td><td>0.3</td><td>9</td><td>54.3</td><td>2</td><td>143</td><td>67.4</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>34</td><td>180</td><td>20.4</td><td>14</td><td>24</td><td>5.7</td><td>0</td><td>190</td><td>-2.35</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>61</td><td>31</td><td>-7.1</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>3.0</td><td>114</td><td>614</td><td>20.5</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>13</td><td>28</td><td>9.0</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>-22.7</td><td>6</td><td>64</td><td>29.5</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>65</td><td>883</td><td>3.5</td><td>158</td><td>36</td><td>-15.2</td><td>777</td><td>2363</td><td>13.2</td></tr><tr><td>UnitedStates</td><td>3181</td><td>3651</td><td>1.5</td><td>333</td><td>1093</td><td>14.1</td><td>8800</td><td>28,369</td><td>13.9</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe other category of investments included in private equity, in addition to venture capital, is buyouts. Buyouts are usually applied to more mature companies. In a leveraged buyout, debt is used to acquire a company and reduce its equity base. Management buyouts are leveraged buyouts where current management takes control of its company.  \n\nOur primary interest is specifically in venture capital, not private equity. We believe venture capital in particular merits interest for several reasons. The past performance of venture capital-backed companies shows that venture capital has been very successful at backing companies with innovative technologies and tremendous growth potential. Companies such as Apple, Compaq, Digital Equipment, Intel, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems were all backed by venture capital. As a measure of the success of these companies, we can consider their total market capitalization, which in July 1997 was $\\mathrm{US}\\$369$ billion.  \n\nThe National Venture Capital Association 1997 report gives further evidence on the beneficial impact of venture capital. In addition to creating jobs at a much faster rate than Fortune 500 companies, venture capital-backed firms have done well even when compared to other high growth companies. 1995 revenue growth for venture capital-backed high growth companies was $36.8\\%$ comparedto $23.8\\%$ for non-venture capital-backed high growth companies.  \n\n## 2.1. The role of venture capital in financial intermediation  \n\nVenture capital firms serve as financial intermediaries in a market where lenders and borrowers find it costly to get together. The costs are due to adverse selection and moral hazard, and the cost of administration, information gathering, and search efforts. By and large, the literature focuses on the important role banks play as financial intermediaries (Mayer, 1988; Fama, 1985; Myers and Majluf, 1984). However, for startup ventures, bank financing may not be optimal. In the US, for example, banks are prohibited from holding equity. But startups have few other tangible assets, and the prohibition makes it difficult for banks to obtain reasonable collateral on loans to startups. This severely restricts banks’ willingness to take the additional risk associated with these new companies. In addition, since startups require a lot of cash in the early stages to finance their growth, debt-based finance is usually inappropriate from a cash management perspective as it strictly ties the cash flows of companies.  \n\nEven in countries such as Japan and Germany, where banks can hold equity, startup ventures are not highly funded by banks. This is to a large extent due to corporate governance issues discussed in the next section.  \n\nGiven the need for financial intermediaries for startups and the unsuitability of banks to this role, the venture capital organization arose to fill this void in startup financing. American Research and Development, founded in Massachusetts in 1946, was the first modern venture capital organization. Venture capital is especially attractive because its equity finance structure gives companies the necessary leeway in their repayment schedule. In addition, by focusing on startups, venture capital firms achieve expertise and economies of scale in locating and financing potentially successful startup ventures.  \n\nGompers (1994) examines “Angels’ as an alternative source of funding for startups. “Angels'’ are essentially wealthy individuals who finance startups out of their own funds. While “Angels'’ represent an important source of financing, their scope is limited by the wealth of these individuals. “^Angels'’ are not a viable source for large amounts of capital. Another source of startup financing is large corporations. However, Sykes (1990) finds that these programs have had limited success.  \n\n## 2.2. Venture capital vs. other forms of corporate governance  \n\nStartup firms present a unique set of issues for corporate governance which makes venture capital particularly suited to the sector. They operate in new markets, where information about the nature of the market is generally poor. Furthermore, they do not have an established track record which could be used as a baseline performance measure. Because so much of their value lies in their potential for future growth and so little in their current, tangible assets, startups place particular demands on monitors of financial performance. Jensen (1993) describes the type of investor needed in this environment as ^^active investor''.  \n\nActive investors are investors who have a large financial interest in their investments, and can still provide an impartial view of the management of these firms. Some of the most common financial intermediaries, such as pension funds, insurance companies and money managers, are unable to perform the role of active investor due to legal structures and customs. Roe (1990) outlines the various restrictions on US banks, insurance companies, and mutuals, which prevent them from holding a large equity stake in any one company and from being actively involved on the boards of their investment companies.  \n\nSahlman (1990) and Jensen (1993) find that venture capitalists solve the corporate governance and monitoring problem through extensive initial due diligence about startup companies’ businesses. Furthermore, they maintain a close relationship by frequently visiting and talking to company management. The venture capitalists also sit on the boards of directors. In some instances, they even perform some key corporate functions for the firm, such as running the corporate finance department and working with suppliers and customers.  \n\nWhile countries such as Japan and Germany do not have restrictions on equity holding by banks, their banks are still not very adept at filling the necessary role as monitor for startups due to institutional design. A few banks dominate Japan's and Germany's banking industry and, often, only those companies with close relationships to these banks can obtain financing. Also, because they are large and provide a wide range of services, these banks do not have the specialization and focus required to handle small startups. Their involvement in management issues at the firms they lend to is often minimal. Edwards and Fischer (1994) document that German banks do not play an active role in management and that bank representation on boards is generally very small.  \n\nLarge companies can also play an active role in the development of smaller enterprises with new ideas. However, this governance model possesses many attributes that reduce the chances of success for startups. Hardymon et al. (1983) find that legal difficulties often arise over whether the corporation has access to ventures’ proprietary information. In addition, corporate venture capital groups within large organizations may not be able to operate autonomously (Siegel et al., 1988). Furthermore, Sahlman (1991) points out that the approval process within large enterprises is neither fast nor effective enough. He also notes that the entrepreneur is not sufficiently motivated, due to the absence of any equity participation and any negative repercussions of failure.  \n\nThus, venture capitalists are the only ones who can really successfully provide the type of corporate governance that startups need.  \n\n## 2.3.Venture capital and entrepreneurship  \n\nWhile the entrepreneurship literature does not emphasize the role of venture capital, its insights suggest that venture capital can be quite important in the context of entrepreneurial challenges. The recent literature, as summarized by Holmes and Schmitz (1990), focuses on the importance of technological innovation and of matching up entrepreneurs with appropriate projects.  \n\nOpportunities for creating new products arise over time as a consequence of technological innovation and demographic change, while the ability to exploit these opportunities varies across the population. Not everyone is capable of starting a new business, and those who have started one are not necessarily capable of managing it competently. Even good business projects must be matched with an appropriate entrepreneur if they are to succeed. If the success of a project hinges vitally on finding a suitable entrepreneur, venture capitalists can greatly aid the success of a project by providing a matching function. They can also assist the process by developing the manager's skills after she has been brought in, and by bringing in additional management talent as needed.  \n\nFurthermore, the literature on entrepreneurship finds that liquidity constraints are binding and, therefore, critical to entrepreneurs (Evans and Jovanovich, 1989). This underscores the importance of venture capital as a way to circumvent liquidity constraints.  \n\n# 3. Venture capital structure and functioning  \n\nBoth the private equity and the venture capital sectors differ across countries. Their differences start with organizational form. In the US and UK, firms are organized as limited partnerships, while in France and Germany they have a different organizational structure with far more involvement of banks (Lerner, 1995a,b). Another difference in organizational form is the prevalence of so-called captive funds in Europe and their relative absence in the US. Funds are labeled captive if more than $80\\%$ of their financing derives from one source. In many instances, captive funds are subsidiaries of banks. In France, in 1995, captive fundsaccountedfor $37.1\\%$ of new funds raised.  \n\nThe management style of venture capitalists differs across countries as well. In Japan and Germany, venture capital firms are not as actively involved in managing their investments as in the US. Japanese and German venture capitalists have traditionally not held board representation, nor have they been involved in day-to-day management issues. Hurry et al. (1991) present evidence on the different degree of involvement of US and Japanese venture capital firms. They show that US firms tend to make fewer investments, but take larger equity stakes in each investment. This strategy confers an advantage over the Japanese one because it allows the venture capitalists to better focus on managing and understanding a few companies and gives them a greater incentive to monitor.  \n\nThe composition of funding sources also differs dramatically by country. If we consider all private equity investing, the US private equity market received $38\\%^{2}$ of its funds from pension funds in 1995. In Germany, by contrast, pension funds suppliedonly $8.6\\%$ of new funds raised and banks supplied $57.2\\%$ in that same year.3  \n\nTables 2-4 indicate how levels of venture capital and private equity differ across time and across countries.

CAGR is the geometric annual growth rate over the time period considered.  \n\nprivate equity and venture capital funding across countries, we normalize our figures by average GDP for each country. Table 4 shows how, in relative terms in 1995, the US had the greatest amount of new fund flows into private equity. Averaged over the whole time period, however, the UK had slightly higher flows into private equity than the Us.  \n\nThe compound annual growth rate of new funds raised was also similar for both countries. This, however, masks some strong differences between the two. US private equity suffered a downswing which bottomed out in 1990, and then steadily rebounded over the next 5 years. UK private equity hit its trough only 1 year later, but then stagnated until 1994.  \n\nAn even more interesting difference, from the perspective of this paper, concerns the difference in early stage investment patterns between countries. If we again look at the US and UK, we see that the UK suffered a steady, unabated decline in early stage investing that took place over the whole time period (see Table 3). As a per mil of GDP, early stage investing dropped from 0.19 to 0.04 in the UK from 1986 to 1995. In the US, by contrast, early stage investing followed closely the development of private equity, with a trough in the early 1990s and steady recovery since then.  \n\nThe emphasis on early stage investing is strong and growing in some countries, such as Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and the Us. In other countries — Germany, Japan, and the UK, to name just a few — private equity is more involved in later stage financing. For example, in 1994, $36\\%$ of Germany's private equity4 was invested in later stage investments. However, for the same time period, only $18\\%$ of US private equity? was similarly invested.  \n\nWhile we recognize that great differences exist in venture capital and private equity firms across countries, we limit our description of organizational structure to the case of the US limited partnership. Since our main interest lies with venture capital and not private equity, we find it advantageous to use the US as an example given the specialization in venture capital that prevails there.  \n\nVenture capital firms in the US are typically organized as limited partnerships with the venture capitalists serving as general partners and the investors serving as limited partners. It was not until the early 1980s that the limited partnership became the predominant form of venture capital funds in the US In 1980, only $40\\%$ of funds were limited partnerships, but by 1992, over $80\\%$ of venture capital funds were organized as such (Gompers and Lerner, 1996). The US venture capital industry exhibits a high degree of geographic concentration. Gompers and Lerner find  that $25\\%$ of US venture capital firms were based in California over the 1972-1992 time period. A large portion of new capital committed comes from pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies and banks. In 1995, they provided $38\\%$ $22\\%$ and $18\\%$ , respectively, of new capital committed.  \n\nIn general, a venture capital firm will manage several pools of capital. Each of these pools of capital, also referred to as funds, is structured as a separate limited partnership. Venture capital firms invest in a broad range of industries, not just high technology startups. A fund will invest in projects over the first 3 to 5 years of its existence. Investments and appreciation are paid out to the partners over the remainder of the fund's life.  \n\nWe have already spoken about the importance of the monitoring that takes place between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. The relationship between venture capitalist and entrepreneur is marked by the following monitoring and control arrangements:  \n\n· Monitoring frequency. Gompers (1995) shows how decreases in industry ratios of tangible assets to total assets, higher market to book ratios and greater R& D intensities lead to more frequent monitoring.   \nCompensation schemes that are designed to provide the entrepreneur with the appropriate incentives. Equity-based compensation gives the entrepreneur the incentive to focus on growth.   \n· Active involvement of the venture capitalist with the company through board representation. Lerner (1995a,b) shows that venture capitalists involvement as directors is more intense when the need for oversight is greater.   \n· Use of convertible securities. These give the venture capitalists the option of selling their stake back to the entrepreneur.  \n\nThe need for monitoring also extends to the relationship between the investor and the venture capitalist. Just as the entrepreneur has an incentive to deviate from behavior that is optimal for the venture capitalist, the venture capitalist has an incentive to deviate from behavior that is optimal for the investor. Investors monitor venture capitalists in the following ways:  \n\n· The life of the venture capital fund is limited, which means that the venture capitalist cannot keep the money forever. The limited lifespan of venture capital funds also ensures that disagreements over when and how to distribute funds are minimized.   \nLimited partners can withdraw from funding the partnership after the initial capital investment. In practice, limited partners rarely withdraw their funds from the partnership. They are more likely to withhold new funds from venture capitalists in future fundraising efforts. Venture capitalists are explicitly prohibited from self-dealing, i.e., receiving preferential investment terms different from those granted to the limited partner.  \n\nIn the late 1980s the use of covenants became very popular. The average number of covenants used per contract grew from 4.4 to 7.9 between the two periods of 1978-1982 and 1988-1992, respectively (Gompers and Lerner, 1996). However, Gompers and Lerner (1996) find that restrictive covenants are only used in the most serious cases because they are very costly to negotiate. They also find that the use of covenants decreases during periods of high demand for venture funding, since the supply of venture capitalist services is rather limited. In this situation, the reduction of covenants is viewed as increased compensation for the venturecapitalist.  \n\n# 4. Factors that affect venture capital  \n\nThe previous section described how venture capitalists manage their investments. This section lays out the theoretical underpinnings of our empirical analysis, and explains what the driving forces are behind venture capital flows. We recognize that we have not included all factors that practitioners would deem important for venture capital. Specifically, we think that capital gains tax rates and the efficiency of bankruptcy procedures also impact venture capital. We encounter difficulties, however, in finding good measures for these variables to include in our empirical analysis. Thus, for instance, while we believe that capital gains taxes are important, using data on individual capital gains tax rates, we find no statistically significant impact on venture capital and, for this reason, we do not report the results in our regressions.  \n\n## 4.1. Initial public offerings  \n\nThe main risk faced by investors and venture capitalists is the risk of not getting their money back. Thus, a viable exit mechanism is extremely important to the development of a venture capital industry. Furthermore, an exit mechanism is essential to the entrepreneur for two reasons. First, it provides a financial incentive for equity-compensated managers to expend effort. Second, it gives the managers a call option on control of the firm, since venture capitalists relinquish control at the time of the IPO (Black and Gilson, 1998).  \n\nWe focus on IPOs as an exit mechanism for the following reasons. While there are many mechanisms to liquidate a fund, the literature shows that the most attractive option is through an IPO. A study conducted by Venture Economics (1988) finds that $\\mathrm{US}\\$1.00$ invested in a firm that eventually goes public yields a $195\\%$ average return (or an average cash return of $\\mathrm{US}\\$1.95$ over the original investment) for a 4.2-year average holding period. The same investment in an acquired firm only provides an average return of $40\\%$ (or a cash return of only 40 cents) over a 3.7-year average holding period. Also, if regaining control is important to the entrepreneur, IPOs are clearly the best choice, given that the other option, trade sales, frequently entails loss of control. Trade sales are sales of a  \n\nTable5 Percentage of divestments that are trade sales   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Country</td><td>1991 (%)</td><td>1992 (%)</td><td>1993 (%)</td><td>1994 (%)</td><td>1995 (%)</td><td>Mean (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td>22</td><td>50</td><td>100</td><td>NA</td><td>24</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>52</td><td>NA</td><td>57</td><td>51</td><td>32</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>24</td><td>7</td><td>70</td><td>62</td><td>85</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>67</td><td>37</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>48</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>41</td><td>56</td><td>57</td><td>33</td><td>48</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>82</td><td>76</td><td>19</td><td>13</td><td>64</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>86</td><td>89</td><td>57</td><td>21</td><td>52</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>48</td><td>44</td><td>22</td><td>24</td><td>44</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Norway</td><td>15</td><td>49</td><td>18</td><td>40</td><td>15</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>NA</td><td>100</td><td>57</td><td>90</td><td>56</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>72</td><td>62</td><td>20</td><td>31</td><td>24</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>13</td><td>40</td><td>78</td><td>43</td><td>25</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>40</td><td>4</td><td>24</td><td>33</td><td>47</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>UK</td><td>24</td><td>22</td><td>41</td><td>30</td><td>36</td><td>30</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTrade sales and divestments are measured in local currency terms.

The data are taken from the EVCA yearbooks.  \n\naccounted for by trade sales ranges from $30\\%$ in the UK to $76\\%$ in Portugal over the whole time period considered (Table 6).  \n\nTo account for the importance of exit mechanisms, we include both current and lagged IPOs in our statistical analysis. We do not have an explicit measure of trade sales. Increased volume of IPOs should have a positive effect on both the demand and supply of venture capital funds. On the demand side, the existence of an exit mechanism gives entrepreneurs an additional incentive to start a company. On the supply side, the effect is essentially the same; large investors are more willing to supply funds to venture capital firms if they feel that they can later recoup their investment.  \n\n## 4.2. Labor market rigidities  \n\nLabor market rigidities present an obstacle to venture capital growth. Sahlman (1990) discusses how labor market rigidities form a large barrier to the success of venture capital investing in countries such as Germany and Japan. In Japan, for instance, leaving a company is not only considered dishonorable, but departing individuals also lose valuable benefits of seniority. Also, should the individual fail in his new venture, it would be difficult for him to find new employment, which would lead to a further loss of social standing. Labor market rigidities are frequently cited as one important reason why venture capital is not more prevalent in Europe and Asia.6  \n\nLabor market rigidity should impact the demand for venture capital funds negatively (i.e., the higher labor market rigidity, the less demand for venture capital funds we would expect). Strict labor laws make hiring employees difficult for companies, because they deprive the company of the flexibility to let people go later on, should this become necessary. In addition, large benefits payments, which typically accompany more rigid labor markets, make it more expensive to hire in the first place.  \n\nWe use two measures of labor market rigidity. One reflects rigidity in the market for skilled labor, the other reflects rigidity in the overall labor market.  \n\n## 4.3. Financial reporting standards  \n\nSmall startup firms are risky prospects. If the market does not have good information on these companies, investors will demand a high risk premium, resulting in more expensive funding for these companies. This cost of asymmetric information can be reduced if the country in which the company operates has strict accounting standards. With good accounting regulation, venture capitalists need to spend less time gathering information to monitor their investments.  \n\nWe include an independent variable that measures the level of accounting standards in the various countries for public firms. Since we are dealing with private firms in our sample, we use this variable as a proxy for reporting standards of private firms. On the supply side, this variable should have a positive effect on the supply of venture capital funds.  \n\n## 4.4. Private pension funds  \n\nRaising money from pension funds provides numerous advantages to the venture capitalist. Venture capitalists can quickly raise a large amount of investment capital solely by approaching a few large pension funds. Furthermore, with only a few investors, a venture capital firm can economize on the amount of time expended on keeping its investors apprised of its activities. In addition, with changes in legislation and perceived high rates of return, many pension funds became eager to lend to venture capitalists. For all these reasons, private pension funds are an important source of venture capital funds in the US. In 1994, pension funds provided $46\\%$ of venture capital money in the United States (Black and Gilson, 1998).  \n\nOn the other hand, raising money from pension funds may present a few disadvantages. For instance, in the US, there may be regulatory compliance issues with ERISA. In addition, managers of pension funds are sophisticated investors who may require additional disclosure. However, these issues do not present a huge barrier for venture capitalists to raise money, especially for venture capitalists with good reputations.  \n\nWe have included private pension fund data as an independent variable in our regressions. Private pension funds should have a positive effect on the supply of new funds to venture capital firms. There is no reason to believe that private pension funds have any effect on demand for venture capital funds.  \n\n## 4.5. Macroeconomic variables  \n\nThe state of the country's economy will also have an effect on venture capital. Acs and Audretsch (1994) suggest that macroeconomic fluctuations influence startup activity in general. Macroeconomic expansions are found to lead to an increase in the number of startups. Since an increase in startup activity increases demand for venture capital funds, we expect a positive relationship between macroeconomic expansion and venture capital investing. We use GDP growth to measure macroeconomic fluctuations in our analysis and expect this variable to be positively correlated with venture capital investment.  \n\nWe also include growth in market capitalization as an explanatory factor for venture capital investing. We believe that increases in market capitalization create a more favorable environment for investors in general. Therefore, increases in market capitalization should be met by greater supply of funds to venture capital investments.  \n\n## 4.6. Government programs  \n\nMany governments have begun to recognize the benefits of venture capital and have made efforts to fund startup businesses. Lerner (1997) provides preliminary evidence that government funded programs can yield favorable benefits. However, O'Shea (1996) points out that there may also be disadvantages to these efforts. For instance, government spending on venture capital may hinder the development of a private venture capital sector. Furthermore, many are sceptical about the government's ability to appropriately target healthy ventures. In addition to looking at government funding in our statistical analysis, we also discuss on a more descriptive level the importance of various government programs in Section 8.1.  \n\n# 5. Data  \n\nThis paper empirically examines 21 countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are selected based on availability of information.  \n\nWe use panel data covering the years 1986-1995. Data on venture capital investments, early stage investments, and new funds raised are obtained from The European Venture Capital Journal, Asian Venture Capital Journal, The GIZA Group for Israel figures, Macdonald's and Associates for Canada figures and Venture Economics for US figures.  \n\nVenture capital investments refer to the total amount disbursed by venture capitalists for seed, startup and expansion stage investments. Early stage investments only include funds used for seed and startup investments. Our New Funds Raised number is dictated by data availability. Ideally, we would look at new funds raised for venture capital. However, the closest we can come to that figure is new funds raised for private equity. New Funds Raised is defined as total funds raised for all private equity investing and includes committed, but not yet paid, capital. Typically, the capital promised by investors to venture capitalists is not immediately paid to the venture capitalists. Most agreements call for a $25-33\\%$ cash commitment up-front and stipulate when addition cash is to be phased in at future dates (Sahlman, 1990). The total amount of investment promised to the venture capitalists is referred to as committed capital, even though only approximately one third is initially paid in.  \n\nCountry GDP data in local currency are provided by the IMF's International Financial Statistics Yearbook. Market capitalization data (annual end of period figures) in billions of US dollars are provided by the IMF's Emerging Markets Fact Book. Total Private Pension fund figures in US Dollars are provided by  \n\nInterSec Research. Exchange rates (annual end of period rates) are obtained from the IMF's International Financial Statistics and are expressed as national currency unit perSDR.  \n\nIPO data are available for 1986-1995 for Canada, Japan and the US, 1989-1995 for the UK, and 1991-1995 for Australia, other European Countries and New Zealand. They are provided by the Federation Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs, Securities Data, Nomura Securities and the Toronto Stock Exchange. These figures exclude privatizations, real estate trusts, utilities and closed-end funds.  \n\nRatings on accounting standards are measured by an index provided by International Accounting and Auditing Trends, Center for International Financial Analysis and Research. This index is created by examining and rating companies' 1990 annual reports on their inclusion or omission of 90 accounting items. A minimum of three companies in each country were studied.  \n\nWe include two measures of labor market rigidity. Our first measure gauges the amount of flexibility in a country's skilled labor market, by measuring the average job tenure of individuals who have completed some or all tertiary education. This statistic best represents the class of individuals who are likely to start new enterprises. For the US, this figure is 7.4 years while for Germany and Japan it is 10.5 and 9.5 years, respectively. Our second measure refers more generally to the entire labor market. It measures the percent of the labor force that has job tenure greater than 10 years. This statistic attempts to capture the flexibility of all individuals to leave their current position to join a startup. While there exist better measures of labor turnover,7 none offers as broad a cross-section as these two statistics. Data for these two measures are provided by the OECD's 1997 Employment Outlook, Chapter 5 (Draft) and 1994 Employment Outlook, respectively.  \n\nWe also use variables from the law and finance literature (La Porta et al.) to measure the efficiency of financial markets. The categorization of legal systems as reported by La Porta et al. (1996) divides countries into four legal traditions: English, French, German, and Scandinavian. The English legal tradition is also referred to as the common law tradition, while the other legal traditions can be grouped together as the civil law traditions. The different legal traditions differ by the extent to which shareholder and creditor rights are protected in the various countries. The common law tradition provides the best legal protections, while the French tradition is the worst in this respect.  \n\nThe variables Rule of Law, Anti-director Rights, and One Share One Vote all describe the amount of protection that shareholders can expect in a given country.  \n\nTable 7 Variable descriptions   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Description</td><td>Sources</td></tr><tr><td>Early Stage Investments</td><td>Early stage investments (Seed and Startup, both government and private sector funded）di- vided by average GDP</td><td>European Venture Capital Journal, Asian Venture Capital Journal, Mac- donald's and Associates for Cana- diandataandVentureEconomics</td></tr><tr><td>Early Stage Investments w/o government funds</td><td>Estimated EarlyStage Invest- ments, funded by private sector sources, divided by average GDP</td><td>for US data European Venture Capital Journal, Asian Venture Capital Journal, Mac- donald's and Associates for Cana- diandataandVentureEconomics</td></tr><tr><td>New Funds Raised</td><td>Annual New Funds raised (both government and private sector funded) domestically divided by average GDP.

(1996). Rule of Law reflects the law and order tradition in a country, as measured by the International Country Risk Guide. The scale ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores for a weaker law and order tradition. Anti-director Rights is an index aggregating shareholder rights. This index is formed by adding one for each of the following conditions: (1) when the country allows shareholders to mail their proxy vote; (2) when shareholders are not required to deposit their shares prior to the General Shareholders’ meeting; (3) when cumulative voting is allowed; (4) when an oppressed minorities mechanism is in place; or (5) when the minimum percentage of share capital that entitles a shareholder to call for an Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting is less than or equalto $10\\%$ . The index ranges from O to 5. One Share One Vote equals one if the company law or the commercial code of the country requires that ordinary shares carry one vote per share. Otherwise it is zero.  \n\nTable 7 provides a summary of the variables used in this paper and theil sources.  \n\n# 6. Methodology  \n\nWe use a linear specification for the supply and demand schedules of venture capital funds. In our regression analysis, we estimate the coefficients of the equilibrium specification.  \n\n## 6.1. Supply and demand structural equations  \n\nAs explained in Section 4, we believe the following factors (in addition to return percentage) influence the supply of venture capital: IPOs, accounting standards, GDP growth, and market capitalization growth. The following simple equation describes the supply of venture funds in the economy:  \n\nVenture capital funds supplied $i t$  \n\nSection 4 also describes the variables that we believe are important for demand for venture capital: IPOs, accounting standards, labor market rigidities, GDP growth and market capitalization growth. A simple equation for the demand side of venture capital is as follows:  \n\nVenture capital funds demanded $i t$  \n\nTo obtain the equilibrium, we solve the supply equation for return percentage, and substitute this expression into the demand equation. Then, taking into account the equality in equilibrium of supply and demand, we solve for the equilibrium quantity.Equilibrium Condition:  \n\nVenture capital funds $i t$  \n\n$$\n =\\pi_{0}+\\pi_{1}\\mathrm{IPOs}_{i t}+\\pi_{2}\\mathrm{Accounting~standards}_{i}\n$$  \n\nwhere, in equilibrium, Venture capital funds supplied $_{i t}=$ Venture capital funds demanded $_{i t}=$ Venture capital fundsi:  \n\nThe equilibrium for new funds raised is analogous. The only difference is that the supply of new funds is also affected by private pension funds. Our regression analysis considers two different forms of the equilibrium equation: the cross-sectional form and the within form.  \n\n## 6.2.

Each variable is normalized by average GDP. Early stage investments, venture capital investments, and new funds raised all include government funds. However, we believe that government funding is driven by considerations different from the ones driving private sector funding. Therefore, we also consider the three dependent variables without public source funds.  \n\n## 6.3.

The explanatory power of all the regressions is high, with $R^{2}\\mathrm{s}$ ranging from 0.49 to 0.71. The coefficient on IPOs is positive and statistically significant for virtually all specifications. This lends support to the hypothesis advanced in Section 4 that high levels of IPOs in a country will lead to more venturecapital.  \n\nTable 10 Early stage investments, between regressions   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Independentvariables</td><td colspan=\"6\">Dependent variables</td></tr><tr><td>(1) Early stage investments w/o gov't funds</td><td>(2) Early stage investments w/o gov't funds</td><td>(3) Early stage investments w/o gov't funds</td><td>(4) Early stage investments</td><td>(5) Early stage investments</td><td>(6) Early stage investments</td></tr><tr><td>IPOs</td><td>0.0044 (0.652)</td><td>-0.0007 (-0.117)</td><td>0.0073 (1.395)d</td><td>0.0024 (0.289)</td><td>-0.0040 (-0.579)</td><td>0.0049 (0.761)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Accounting Standards</td><td>-0.000001</td><td rowspan=\"2\">9.3×10-9 (-0.004)</td><td>-0.000002</td><td>-0.000001</td><td rowspan=\"2\">-0.000003 (0.985)</td><td>-0.000002</td></tr><tr><td>(-0.582)</td><td>(-1.421)d</td><td>(-0.409)</td><td>(-1.001)</td></tr><tr><td>Labor MarketRigidity</td><td colspan=\"2\">-0.00002</td><td>-0.00001</td><td>-0.00001</td><td></td><td>-0.00001</td></tr><tr><td>(educated)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(-1.469)d</td><td rowspan=\"2\">-0.000006</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(-1.367)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(-0.981)</td><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td rowspan=\"2\">(-0.921)</td></tr><tr><td>Labor MarketRigidity</td></tr><tr><td>(general)</td><td></td><td>(-2.625)a</td><td></td><td></td><td>(-2.016)b</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Market capitalization</td><td>-0.00003</td><td>-0.0002</td><td>-0.00004</td><td>0.00002</td><td>-0.00007</td><td>-0.00009</td></tr><tr><td>growth</td><td>(-0.233)</td><td>(-1.365)</td><td>(-0.297)</td><td>(0.099)</td><td>(-0.493)</td><td>(0.060)</td></tr><tr><td>GDP growth</td><td>0.0006 (0.704)</td><td>0.00037 (0.509)</td><td></td><td>0.0005 (0.504)</td><td>0.0005 (0.681)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>0.00024 (1.269)</td><td>0.00029 (1.275)</td><td>0.0003 (1.867)b</td><td>0.0002 (0.939)</td><td>0.00008 (0.315)</td><td>0.0003 (1.387)d</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.3672</td><td>0.6760</td><td>0.3323</td><td>0.1740</td><td>0.6152</td><td>0.1507</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nBetween regression of 15 countries.

This explanation involves reverse causality: Since venture capital investments frequently end up as IPOs, a higher level of such investments will lead to a higher level of IPOs down the road. Thus, our coefficient would be positive not because more IPOs lead to more venture capital, but because higher levels of venture capital eventually show up as greater amounts ofIPOs.  \n\nTo test for this reverse causality story, we examine several subpanels of our original panel, where the subpanels cover shorter time periods. The time periods are chosen such that investment projects started during the period will not have had enough time to progress to the IPO stage. The time periods are 1992-1995 and 1993-1995, and the results are contained in Table 9A. The results allow us to reject the reverse causality story, as the coefficient on IPOs remains positive and significant.  \n\nAnother way to test the reverse causality explanation is to look at the factors underlying IPOs, which are not dependent on venture capital. La Porta et al. (1996) analyze the legal determinants of IPO finance as part of their study into the legal determinants of external finance. They find that Rule of Law has a large positive effect on the number of IPOs. Furthermore, a higher degree of Anti-director Rights also leads to more IPOs. Even when they correct for specific differences in shareholder rights, they find that civil law countries (the German and French origin ones in particular) still have a significant negative impact on the amount of IPOs in a country.  \n\nBy regressing venture capital investments on shareholder rights and legal origin dummies in Table 9B, we can show to what extent these investments are dependent on the variables underlying IPOs. Rule of Law and Anti-director Rights are not significant in this regression. The civil law variables, however, are.

These results indicate that the same factors driving IPOs also drive venture capital investments. The connection between IPOs and venture capital investing appears more substantial than the reverse causality story would indicate. It appears that structural factors are driving the positive relationship between the two, and that we are not just observing the move, over time, of venture capital flows into IPO flows.  \n\nWhen we include government funded investments in total venture capital, the significance of IPOs drops, as measured by the $t\\cdot$ -statistic (Specifications 4-6). This implies that government investments are less sensitive to IPOs. From this, we infer that government funded venture capital supports investments in environments that are less favorable to venture capital (i.e., in environments where the IPO market is not strong).  \n\nThe government funded projects might nevertheless be sensible from an economic perspective, and might offer adequate returns. In order to decide whether this is the case, it would be helpful to have data on rates of return. There is some US evidence that government supported venture capital can select good projects. Lerner (1999) shows that companies that receive SBIR awards experienced higher growth relative to a matched sample. However, without more comprehensive data on returns for the various funds in our sample, we are unable to say whether government funds support high-return projects in environments that otherwise would not have supported them, or whether government funds back low-return projects. Our result does, however, indicate that government involvement can generate venture capital investments where otherwise there would have been none.  \n\nThe variable for accounting standards has a statistically significant negative coefficient. This result is surprising, as we expect a positive coefficient. This finding could be explained as follows: as we mentioned earlier, the accounting standards under consideration are those used by public firms. Therefore, they only provide a proxy for accounting standards at privately held firms. This proxy may not be correctly measuring the private firms’ accounting standards. Furthermore, Wright and Robbie (1996) provide evidence that accounting information is only one part of the venture capitalist's assessment process. While accounting information is an important piece in the decision making process, other elements, such as discussions with personnel and access to unpublished and subjective assessments, are also widely used. This insight, however, could only explain why accounting standards do not have a positive significant coefficient. The statistically significant negative coefficient,however, can still not be entirely understood.  \n\nTable 10 contains the results from the between regression of early stage investments on IPOs, labor market rigidities, accounting standards, market capitalization and GDP growth. While labor market rigidity was not significant in the regressions on venture capital, the coefficients on labor market rigidities in this specification, with early stage venture capital, are negative and significant. The significance for overall labor market rigidity is higher than that for rigidity of the more highly educated labor market. These results confirm the hypothesis advanced in Section 4 that labor market rigidities pose a hindrance to venture capital.  \n\nTable 14   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">(A) Private equity new funds raised, within regressions</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">Independentvariables</td><td>Dependentvariables</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(1)Privateequitynew funds raised</td><td>(2)Privateequitynew funds raised</td><td>(3)Private equitynew funds raised</td><td>(4)Privateequitynew funds raised</td></tr><tr><td>w/ogov'tfunds</td><td>w/o gov't funds</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.0736 (2.188)a</td><td>0.0509 (2.109)a</td><td>0.0617 (1.819)b</td><td>0.0344 (1.218)</td></tr><tr><td>Lagged IPOs</td><td>0.0721 (2.355)a</td><td></td><td>0.0632 (2.043)a</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PrivatePensionFundgrowth</td><td>-0.0002(-0.388)</td><td>-0.00009（-0.479)</td><td>-0.0002 (-0.481)</td><td>-0.00007(-0.299)</td></tr><tr><td>Marketcapitalizationgrowth</td><td>0.00007 (0.234)</td><td>-0.00002（-0.092)</td><td>0.000002 (0.006)</td><td>0.00007 (0.235)</td></tr><tr><td>GDP growth</td><td>0.0026 (0.585)</td><td>0.0023 (1.048)</td><td>0.0003 (0.064)</td><td>0.0039 (1.181)</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>0.0004 (1.607)c</td><td>0.0006 (3.839)a</td><td>0.0006 (2.527)a</td><td>0.0007 (3.139)a</td></tr><tr><td>R²</td><td>0.2060</td><td>0.0504</td><td>0.1448</td><td>0.0450</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n(B) Private equity new funds raised, within regressions2   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Independentvariables</td><td colspan=\"2\">Dependentvariables</td></tr><tr><td>(1)Privateequitynew funds raised w/o gov't funds</td><td>(3)Privateequitynew funds raised</td></tr><tr><td>IPOs</td><td>0.0731 (1.976)b</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Lagged IPOs</td><td>-0.0078(-0.206)</td><td>0.0786 (2.110)a -0.0083 (-0.217)</td></tr><tr><td>PrivatePensionFundgrowth</td><td>-0.0004(-0.897)</td><td>-0.0004(-0.898)</td></tr><tr><td>PrivatePensionFundlevels</td><td>0.0036 (2.552)a</td><td>0.0036 (2.576)a</td></tr><tr><td>Marketcapitalizationgrowth</td><td>-0.0001(-0.275)</td><td>-0.00006 (-0.179)</td></tr><tr><td>GDP growth</td><td>0.0036 (0.804)</td><td>0.0031 (0.684)</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>-0.0002 (-0.600)</td><td>-0.0002(-0.545)</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.3426</td><td>0.3251</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThere are several reasons why labor market rigidities might affect early stage venture capital and not later stage venture capital. First, the probability of an early stage investment going bankrupt is higher, which increases the probability that the employees of the venture will have to find other jobs. All things being equal, this will be more difficult in a country with higher labor market rigidity. Also, given the liquidity constraints of an early stage venture which, in most cases, has no regular revenue stream, it is increasingly difficult to hire employees because the environment offers the employer less flexibility to let people go and imposes higher costs of benefits for unemployment insurance, etc.  \n\nIt is surprising that the coefficient on IPOs in the early stage investment specification of Table 10 is not significantly different from zero. This implies that countries with higher levels of IPOs do not have significantly higher levels of early stage venture investments as well. This is particularly puzzling in light of our results later on, in Table 13, which show that early stage investments are sensitive to IPOs over time. Since IPOs are significant in the fixed effects, within regression specification of Table 13, it is likely that we have not identified all the variables which affect early stage venture capital in the between regression. Another signal that we do not have all relevant variables is that the R-squareds for early stage investments, with a range of 0.15 to 0.68 (Table 10), are much lower than the $R^{2}\\mathrm{s}$ for venture capital investment, which range from 0.49 to 0.71. One variable that might account for some of the unexplained variation is the amount of trade sales that take place. Trade sales are another exit mechanism, in addition to IPOs. We do not, however, at present have a measure for the prevalence of trade sales.  \n\nWhen we consider new funds raised for all private equity endeavors in Table 11A and B, we find, as we found for venture capital investments, that IPOs have a positive and significant coefficient. As was the case for venture capital investments, the explanatory power of our regressions is quite high, with $R^{2}\\mathrm{s}$ ranging from 0.82 to 0.87. Since we are considering funds raised for projects that range in size and riskiness across a broad spectrum, a variable that affects smaller, riskier ventures such as labor market rigidity, does not have a significant coefficient.  \n\nThe coefficients on pension fund levels and growth rates are not statistically significant. We think that this is due, in part, to the fact that pension funds are regulated diferently in the sample countries. The regulations hypothesis is supported by the evidence in Table 14A and B, which shows that, once fixed effects are taken into account, pension fund levels do have a positive and significant impact on new funds raised.  \n\nIn all regressions, contrary to our expectation, the coefficients on GDP and market capitalization growth are not statistically significant. The absence of significance on our macro-economic variable, GDP growth, underscores the importance of IPOs as the main explanatory factor for venture capital and private equity investments.  \n\n## 7.2. Within regression results  \n\nThe within regressions allow us to understand how variation across time in the explanatory variables affects venture capital, early stage investments, and new fund flows. Table 12 reports the results of the within regression of venture capital investments on IPOs, lagged IPOs, market capitalization growth and GDP growth. The current level of IPOs has a positive, significant coefficient, emphasizing, once again, the importance of IPOs. The other variables are statistically insignificant.  \n\nTable 13 reports the results of the within regression for early stage investments. IPOs have a positive effect on the level of early stage investments from year to year. Thus, even though the average level of IPOs does not affect the amount of early stage investments (as we saw in Table 10), early stage investments are still affected by yearly fluctuations in the amount of IPOs.  \n\nTable 14A and B reports results on within regressions of new funds raised. IPOs are again strongly significant with a positive sign. Lagged IPOs are also positive and statistically significant in Specifications 1 and 3 of Table 14A. Table 14B shows that private pension fund levels have a positive and significant coefficient, as expected. Again, the implications of these results indicate the omission of an individual country effect in the between regressions which is being picked up in the fixed effect regression.  \n\n# 8. Descriptive analysis  \n\nIn addition to the statistically measurable factors of the previous section, specific details of institutions, regulation, and culture also affect venture capital.  \n\nFor this reason, we include a study of government programs for venture capital, as well as brief case studies on venture capital in Germany and Israel. In Germany, venture capital has grown a lot. However, it has still not reached the level of significance that it has in the US or the UK. Israel, by contrast, is an example of successful venture capital development outside of the US. In 1993, new funds raised (per mil of GDP) in Israel exceeded those of any other country within our sample.  \n\n## 8.1. The role of government programs  \n\nGovernment schemes for assisting private equity vary widely, from providing legal infrastructure to establishing funds that invest directly in private equity projects. We examine some of the larger government programs, and show how they influence private equity flows.  \n\nGetting the basic legal and tax structures into place appears to be an important factor in aiding the development of private equity funds. For example, the US and the UK, which have good basic regulations, have high levels of private equity and venture capital investments as a percentage of GDP. Austria, on the other hand, lies on the opposite extreme of this spectrum. With no special legal structure for private equity firms and no tax or other incentives aimed at the industry, private equity investment languishes and shows no sign of growth in the near future.  \n\nPortugal furnishes another example of the importance of providing an appropriate legal environment for private equity. In 1986, when Portugal had even lower levels of private equity investment (again measured as a proportion of GDP) than Austria, the Portuguese government created a new type of corporate structure, the venture capital corporation. These venture capital corporations were granted a number of tax benefits as follows:8  \n\n·Exemption from the new company incorporation tax   \n· Exemption from income tax and other taxes during the year of incorporation and the three following years   \nAfter this period, deduction from tax of the profits appropriated to reserves and reinvested in venture capital projects during the following 3 years  \n\nAs a consequence, private equity investments in Portugal increased dramatically (by a factor of 38) between 1986 and 1987.  \n\nIn addition, growth of private equity in Portugal benefited from direct government funding. Through a variety of government agencies (the most important being the two EC supported regional development agencies NORDEPIP and  \n\nSULDEPIP), the Portuguese government contributed strongly to the growth in private equity funds in the early 1990s. In 1992, government agencies contributed Esc 460 million $(\\mathrm{U}S\\$3.1$ million) to new funds raised, or $15\\%$ of the total. By 1994, this figure had grown to Esc 12.8 billion $(\\mathrm{US}\\$80.5$ million), which represented $57\\%$ of new funds raised. Thus, the large increase in government financing was met by a similarly large increase in private funds. The increase in private funding appears sustainable, independent of continued large government programs. Thus, when government funding decreased from Esc 12.8 billion $(\\mathrm{US}\\$80.5$ million) in 1994 to Esc 2 billion $(\\mathrm{US}\\$13.4$ million) in 1995, an increase in bank funding from Esc 8.9 billion （ $\\mathrm{US}\\$59.5$ million） to Esc 13.7 billion $(\\mathrm{US}\\$91.7$ million) made up much of the shortfall.9  \n\nIn Norway, government funded private equity investments appear to have been a strong factor involved in rebuilding private equity after the banking crisis of the late 1980s. In 1989, Norway's private equity market bottomed out with only NKr 8 million ( $\\mathrm{US}\\$1.2$ million) in investments (less than $10\\%$ of the level of the previous year). The resurgence in the industry in 1990 (when NKr 392 million $(\\mathrm{US}\\$66.4$ million) was invested) is, according to the EVCA, in part a consequence of a $\\mathrm{NKr}800$ million $(\\mathrm{US}\\$120.9$ million) program launched by the government in 1989 as a way of strengthening the Norwegian venture capital industry.10  \n\nIn 1993, the Norwegian State Industrial and Regional Development Fund was started. This marked a transition point in the government's share of venture capital investing. From 1993 to 1995, government source investments increased from NKr 120 million $(\\mathrm{US}\\$16$ million) , which constituted approximately one third of total investments, to NKr 535 million $(\\mathrm{US}\\$84.7$ million), or $50\\%$ of private equity investments. Furthermore, the government's involvement appears to have spurred other types of investors, as total investment moved from NKr 350 million $(\\mathrm{US}\\$46.6$ million) to NKr 990 million $(\\mathrm{US}\\$156.7$ million) over the same period of time.11  \n\nGovernments can also play a strong role in influencing the growth of other sources of funds. For example, Ireland experienced a large surge in new funds raised as a consequence of a government-recommended increase in private equity investments by pension funds. A commitment of IR f50 million $\\mathrm{\\Delta(US\\Phi}70.5$ million) boosted new funds raised considerably, from IR f23 million ( $\\mathrm{\\DeltaUS}\\$32.4$ million) in 1993 to IR f150 million $(\\mathrm{US}\\$9232.1$ million) in 1994.12  \n\nSimilarly, in the US around 1980, a large flow of new funds in venture capital was unleashed with changes in the Employment Retirement Income Securities  \n\nACT (ERISA), that permitted venture capital investing for pension funds.13 In Australia, a similar measure was undertaken in 1985, when the Reserve Bank changed its rules to allow banks to make equity investments in small and medium sized enterprises.14 The Italian government has also recently given pension funds permission to invest in privately held small and medium sized enterprises.f? In Finland, banks and pension funds were also encouraged to invest in venture capital and in 1995, the share of these institutions in total venture capital raised went to $79\\%$ ,upfrom $20\\%$ in 1994.16  \n\nWhile government funding of private equity is minimal in the UK, government support of the industry occurs through the legislative structure of venture capital. The UK incentive schemes are:17  \n\nVenture Capital Trust (VCT): VCTs provide income tax relief on investments and capital gains tax deferral in the case of capital reinvestment.   \nEnterprise Investment Schemes (EIS): The EIS, successor program to the Business Expansion Scheme, provides up-front tax relief on investments, along with relief from capital taxation.   \n· Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme (SFLGS): SFGLS was introduced in 1981. Under this scheme, 41,000 loans were made between 1986 and 1996.   \nShare option schemes, which allow innovative and precisely tailored incentive compensation plans to be implemented   \nDirect financing through grants and awards is also available. These programs, however, are fairly small. Thus, for example, two of the large technologyoriented programs distribute only f50 million ( $\\mathrm{_{US\\S75}}$ million) per year.  \n\nAnother example of government involvement in a mature private equity market is the Netherlands. Government involvement in the Netherlands is still significant, but it is declining. The nominal figure for public investments has not changed substantially since the early 1990s, but its overall importance has declined, as the industry has grown. Thus in 1992, public sector investments were DFl 65 million $(\\mathrm{US}\\$35,8$ million) compared to DFl 55 million ( $(\\mathrm{US}\\$34.3$ million) in 1995. As a share of total investments, however, the public sector commitment dropped from $12\\%$ to $6\\%$ over the same time period.18  \n\nFurthermore, the Netherlands government has scaled back its venture capital commitments in other ways. The guarantee scheme for private venture capital companies launched in $1981^{19}$ was a cornerstone of government support. Under this scheme, the government covered up to $50\\%$ of losses incurred by venture capital companies. This scheme was reduced in 1990, and discontinued at the end of 1995. However, the reduction of government support programs for venture capital has not reduced the size of the venture capital industry in the Netherlands. On the contrary, over the period from 1990 to 1995, private equity investments as a percentage of GDP grew from $0.11\\%$ to $0.15\\%$ . Given its level of maturity, the Dutch private equity industry was capable of maintaining its growth, despite the gradual withdrawal of government support.  \n\nThus, whether we consider the legal and tax environment, loss guarantees, direct expenditures, or government encouragement of investment, it is clear that the government can play an important role in the development of private equity. Mature venture capital industries are quite capable of maintaining healthy levels even after this support is withdrawn.  \n\n## 8.2. Israel venture capital case study  \n\nBetween 1988 and 1992, Israel's venture capital industry was still in its infancy with only one active venture capital fund of $\\mathrm{US}\\$30$ million. At this time, the major suppliers of capital to emerging companies were large established investment companies belonging to holding groups such Hapolain, DB, Leumi, Israel, Koor, Clal and Elron Groups.  \n\nIn 1992, the Likud government began to promote the venture capital industry. It set up the Yozma venture capital program to provide financing for venture capital funds and to invest directly in companies. Yozma also encouraged foreign and local corporations to coinvest in high technology startups. In 1993, Yozma provided $\\operatorname{USS100}$ million to establish nine venture capital funds. By 1996, Israel's venture capital industry, which had raised more than $_\\mathrm{US}\\$1$ billion, had experienced such phenomenal growth that the government decided to exit the market. However, to continue to foster its venture capital industry, the Israeli government enacted a temporary legislation allowing tax-free investing in  Israeli  venture capital funds by foreign venture funds which had tax-free status in their home countries. Currently, there are 32 venture capital funds with a total of $\\mathrm{US}\\$500$ million invested which represents $50\\%$ of raised capital.  \n\nAnother attribute which fostered the growth of Israeli's venture capital industry is Israel's favorable taxation laws for individual investors. For persons not in the business of trading securities, capital gains on sales of securities on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) or securities of Israeli companies listed on recognized foreign exchanges are exempt from capital gains taxes in Israel. For individual residents, dividends are taxed at a maximum of $25\\%$ and interest is taxed at a maximum of $45\\%$ . Furthermore, some resident corporations receive a tax break on dividends. Finally, foreign investors face a maximum tax rate of $25\\%$ on dividends and interest. These laws made investing in equity securities extremely attractive which, in turn, produced a vibrant equity securities market. For reasons mentioned earlier, this provides a conducive environment for venture capital.  \n\nA record number of Israeli firms have successfully gone public. Some recent examples are M-Systems, Gilat Satellite, Mercury Interactive and DSP Group. The TASE is by far the strongest Middle East capital market with 654 listed companies in 1995. Total equity market capitalization as of December 1995 was $\\mathrm{US}\\$37$ billion, approximately $42\\%$ of Israel's GDP. Between 1991 and 1995, Israel's growth in market value was $589\\%$ in local currency. At the same time, Israel's economy had been very strong with GDP growth averaging $5.5\\%$ per year since 1991.  \n\nInitial public offerings for Israeli companies are not limited to TASE. In 1996, approximately 50 Israeli companies raised $\\operatorname{US}\\$1.$ billion on US exchanges. In addition, trade sales are a very popular exit mechanism for venture capital startups. In 1995, foreign companies acquired a significant number of Israeli startups. Some recent examples are America-on-Line's acquisition of Ubique, Boston Scientific's acquisition of Medinol and Intel's acquisition of Shamy.  \n\nMost portfolio companies in Israel's venture capital funds are in the early stage with an average company age of approximately 1.5-2 years. Currently, Israeli venture capital funds are primarily invested in technology companies such as telecommunications, data communications, industrial electronic equipment, software, multimedia and medical technology.  \n\nThe bulk of these startup companies were founded by scientists and engineers who left their previous jobs to start their own companies. Also, the immigration of many skilled scientists and researchers from the former Soviet Union fueled Israel's boom in technology research. Venture capitalists are especially attracted to these R& D startups because many of these new enterprises received grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The OCS administers the Law for Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development which targets developing science intensive industry and expands the technology infrastructure of the state. The OCS's 1995 annual budget was $\\mathrm{US}\\$370$ million,up from ${\\mathrm{US}}\\$110$ million in 1990. Currently, it supports close to one thousand companies.  \n\nFinally, the BIRD Foundation (Binational Industrial Research and Development) promotes US /Israeli corporate partnership investments in Israeli high technology startups. The average budget is $_\\mathrm{US}\\$1$ million over a 12-15 month period. BIRD typically provides half of all R&D expenses, but does not take an equity position in the enterprise. Instead, BIRD receives $150\\%$ repayment from successful projects. Currently, BIRD invests ${\\mathrm{US}}\\$114$ million in 391 different projects.  \n\nThe venture capital industry in Israel is becoming a significant part of the country's economy. Several factors have contributed to its success. While the government has played an important role in nurturing the industry, Israel's strong equity markets, and cultural and institutional factors, have allowed venture capital toprosper.  \n\n## 8.3. Germany venture capital case study  \n\nGermany's tradition of government support for the business sector dates back to the post-WWIl programs dedicated to rebuilding industry. While these programs bolstered the growth of small to medium sized companies in general, they did not focus on venture capital specifically.20  \n\nOne of Germany's most important small and medium enterprise programs is the European Recovery Program (ERP) which was started in 1947. It focuses on growing small businesses, primarily by providing low interest loans. ERP funds are disbursed by the Deutsche Ausgleichsbank (German Bank for Compensation) and the Deutsche Bank fuer Wiederaufbau (German bank for Reconstruction).  \n\nThe ERP also supports research and development programs, as do state and regionally administered funds. In addition to the federally funded and administered programs, the states also have programs intended to support small and mediumsized businesses. Most of these programs emphasize interest rate or loan subsidies to existing businesses, and do not therefore contribute much to the development of startups. Many of the programs weigh non-profit-maximizing objectives, such as labor market or environmental considerations, quite heavily.  \n\nKapitalbeteiligungsgesellschaften (Equity Stock Companies) were initiated in the 1950s and 1960s as yet another government institution intended to foster growth in small and medium-sized companies. Kapitalbeteiligungsgesellschaften (KBGs) are owned and funded by banks and state governments. Depending on whether they are public or private, the KBGs are more or less profit oriented. They provide equity or near-equity to established small firms that require financing for expansion purposes. KBGs are regulated with respect to their portfolio holdings, and for this reason tend to shy away from risky startup ventures. KBG investments are very hands-off. The KBGs provide little management supervision or support even though they might be involved with a company for up to 8 years.  \n\nUntil the early 1970s, there was no institutional structure available in Germany for the support of more risky startup ventures. When, in the 1970s, Germany's economic growth started to slow, consideration was given to how more growth could be generated in the small business sector. This led to the founding of  \n\nGermany's first venture capital company, the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Wagniskapital (German Society for Venture Capital, WFG).  \n\nThe founding of the WFG marked the beginning of modern venture capital in Germany. Its members were a group of 29 German financial institutions. Government involvement in the project was significant. The government agreed to cover $75\\%$ of capital losses, and also offered the prospect of generous assistance to cover operating expenses, should the need arise.  \n\nWhile it initially focused on startup enterprises, the WFG shifted emphasis somewhat in the early 1980s, when its funds were divided equally among startups companies earning DM 1 to 10 million ( $\\mathrm{{US}\\Phi.\\mathrm{{0.6}}}$ to 6 million) per year — and companies earningbetween $\\mathrm{DM}20$ and50million $(\\mathrm{US}\\$11.4$ to 28.6 million).  \n\nIn 1984, the WFG was restructured. The emphasis shifted toward later stage investments, and the number of partners was reduced to five. The specific industry focus (on high technology) from earlier years was abandoned, and non-technology investments came to represent a larger portion of the portfolio. Involvement in management decisions was still fairly limited.  \n\nIn 1988, the WFG underwent another organizational change. Deutsche Bank, one of the partners in the WFG venture, bought out the other partners and integrated the WFG into its own subsidiary.  \n\nOther players gradually entered the scene. The initial entrants all had government backing. The second venture capital firm to enter the scene was the Hannover Finanz, in 1979. The third venture capital firm appeared in 1982: the Landesfonds des Landes Berlin. In 1983, eight new companies entered the growing field of competitors. By 1995, the German Venture Capital Association had over 100 members.  \n\nFrom 1989 to 1995, Germany had a program called Beteiligungskapital fur Junge Technologieunternehmen (Equity Participation for Young Technology Companies, BJTU),21 administered by a subsidiary of the government owned Deutsche Ausgleichsbank. This was a co-investment scheme which gave the owner of the business the option of buying out the government share at a premium over the initial investment. If the company did not fare well, the founder was given the option of selling his share to the government at a discount to book value.  \n\nA successor was created to the popular BJTU program. The Beteiligungskapital fur Kleine Technologieunternehmen (Equity Participation for Small Technology Companies, BTU) was created in 1995, and slated to last through 2000.22 The BTU focuses on new firms. BTU funds will only be brought in at a level that matches the investment of a private investor. The program also contains a guarantee scheme which covers up to $50\\%$ of losses to the private investor.  \n\nThe institutional structures in place in Germany over the 1980s and, to a lesser extent, the 1990s have hindered the development of a venture capital industry on the scale of the UK or the US. The tax system in Germany does not favor venture capital investments by corporations. They cannot obtain a capital gains tax rates reduction. Corporate investments are taxed at the $56\\%$ corporate tax rate. Trade taxes and capital transaction taxes provide an additional burden.  \n\nIn 1987, the Geregelter Markt was established as a means to provide an exit mechanism for startup firms. The other two markets already available in Germany at this time, the Amtlicher Handel (main stock market) and the Telefonverkehr (an unregulated market similar to the US OTC market), did not provide a sufficiently liquid exit mechanism. However, listing companies on the Geregelter Markt is still not easy, and is subject to stringent requirements. The companies that satisfy these criteria tend to do well, but only a small number of companies can qualify. In 1995 plans were introduced to provide a new exchange, called the Neuer Markt, which would offer young and fast-growing companies a way to raise capital.  \n\nGermany has also experimented with regulatory incentives for venture capital. In 1987, Unternehmensbeteiligungsgesellschaften (Societies for Enterprise Participation, UBGs) were introduced, which benefit from a somewhat more favorable tax status than other types of investment vehicles. The pace of regulatory change increased in the 1990s, but still failed to introduce sweeping changes to the system. Regulations for public promoted venture capital companies were loosened in 1991. In 1994, the operating environment for UBGs was improved.  \n\nDespite government programs intended to encourage venture capital, venture capital in Germany is still relatively insignificant. New and early stage investments as a percentage of GDP were only 0.0063 in 1995. Part of the problem in Germany appears to be both a cultural and institutional23 aversion to risk taking. While some recent success stories24 on the German venture capital market indicate that this might be changing, Germany has still not evolved into a hotbed of venture capital activity.  \n\n# 9. Conclusion  \n\nPrivate equity and venture capital markets have been subject to strong cyclical fluctuations over the years. Bygrave and Timmons (1992) describe several cycles that have marked the US venture capital experience. A very slow start in the 1940s eventually led to a boom in the 1960s. A downturn through most of the 1970s gave way to another successful period in the 1980s. A brief but sharp downturn at the start of the 1990s has been followed by another boom. The experience outside the US has been marked by similar ups and downs, albeit over a shorter period of time, stretching back to the 1970s. We have compiled a statistical track record that allows us to not only understand these swings over time, but that also gives us insight into the differences in private equity and venture capital across countries.  \n\nWe show that, over time, IPOs are the main force behind the cyclical swings in venture capital. This result confirms the conventional wisdom on venture capital. We also discover a surprising result, which is that early and later stage venture capital investments are affected quite differently by the determinants of venture capital. Over time, IPOs explain less of the year to year fluctuations in early stage than in later stage investments. Our finding across countries is even more surprising: while later stage venture capital investments respond strongly to different levels of IPOs across countries, early stage investments are unaffected.  \n\nThese results point to the need for further research focusing on early stage venture capital investments, and reinforce the notion that the distinct stages of venture capital are fundamentally different. We believe that there are several factors that are determinants of early, but not later, stage venture capital. One of these factors which we have been able to identify is labor market rigidities. Labor market rigidities affect variation in early stage venture capital across countries, but do not explain variation in later stage venture capital.  \n\nGiven the importance of IPOs it is surprising that venture capitalists in countries with underdeveloped IPO markets do not avail themselves of the more developed IPO markets in countries like the US. This strategy of bringing companies to the US for the purpose of an IPO has been pursued successfully by the Israeli venture capital industry. A number of Israeli firms have had IPOs on the NASDAQ. It is not clear why venture capitalists in other countries have not pursued a similar strategy.  \n\nThere still appears to be a very strong home bias in the venture capital industry in general. This is expressed in two ways. First, venture capitalists tend to invest in their home country. The costs of monitoring distant companies (Lerner, 1995a,b) can at least partially explain why the home bias might affect investments. Second, venture capitalists also seek to exit their investments in the home country. This can again be partially explained by the time and effort it takes to sell a business. An IPO in a foreign country involves more cost and effort than an IPO in the home country.  \n\nThe additional costs incurred do not appear very high, and are unlikely to be as high as the monitoring costs incurred by investing in a foreign country. There may also be certain fixed costs associated with exiting through a non-domestic IPO. Once the barrier is breached, as it clearly is the case with Israel's many successful IPOs in the US market, additional IPOs might become easy to arrange. For venture capital industries that have not yet had many foreign IPOs, as is the case with Germany's, it might still be very costly to arrange these transactions. Given the importance of IPOs and the apparent solution for low IPO countries of listing on markets like the NASDAQ, the question of why there is such a strong home bias needs to be further addressed.  \n\nOur results on private pension fund levels and growth rates point to a need for a greater understanding of cross-country determinants. In our analysis of new private equity funds raised, we find that pension fund levels are significant over time, but insignificant across countries. We believe that some of these additional determinants, which would help explain differences across countries, can be found in regulatory and policy structures.  \n\nOur qualitative analysis shows that government policies can act as catalysts to galvanize private fund flows and investments. On a more quantitative, statistical level, our study of government involvement has produced some interesting results. We show that, compared to private venture capital, government-funded venture capital is less sensitive to IPOs across countries. Once again, the story for early stage investing is different: the difference in sensitivity of government-backed and non-government-backed early stage investments to IPOs drops by half in some specifications. These differences are only present when we compare across countries. Over time, the differences between the sensitivity of private and public venture capital to IPOs are negligible.  \n\nOur observation that government-backed venture capital is less sensitive to IPOs across countries than non-government-backed venture capital indicates a direction for future research. Governments appear to be willing to finance early stage projects that would not be funded privately. To evaluate the usefulness of the government role, it is important to understand the economic value of these projects. If more data on returns were available, they could be used to better understand the role of government in venture capital.  \n\nBy providing an empirical analysis of private equity and venture capital across countries, we have been able to confirm the value of having a well-functioning exit mechanism in the form of a strong IPO market. We have also shown that some segments of the venture capital market behave quite differently from others. Our findings regarding the need for a more differentiated approach to venture capital are especially important, in that they concern two areas — early stage investing and government involvement — that are of particular interest to policy makerstoday.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nWe thank Paul Gompers, Josh Lerner, and Andrei Shleifer for helpful conversations.

    "reference_markdown": "# Profits Without Prosperity: How Stock Buybacks Manipulate the Market, and Leave Most Americans Worse Off  \n\nWilliam Lazonick The Academic-Industry Research Network (www.theAIRnet.org) and University of Massachusetts Lowell  \n\nApril 2014  \n\nPaper prepared for the Annual Conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, Toronto, April 10-12, 2014. Funding for the research in this paper was funded by the Institute for New Economic Thinking for the projects “\"The Stock Market and Innovative Enterprise\" and “Impatient Capital in High-Tech Industries\", and by the Ford Foundation for the project, “Financial Institutions for Innovation and Development\". I acknowledge with gratitude the extensive comments on earlier drafts of this paper by Ken Jacobson of The Academic-Industry Research Network, and by Steve Prokesch and Justin Fox of Harvard Business Review.  \n\n## Corporate resource allocation and shared prosperity  \n\nFive years after the end of the Great Recession, corporate profits are high and the stock market is booming. Yet most Americans are not sharing in the apparent prosperity. While the top $0.1\\%$ of income recipients, the highest-ranking corporate executives among them, reap almost all the income gains, good jobs keep disappearing, and new employment opportunities tend to be insecure and underpaid. Corporate profitability is not translating into shared prosperity.  \n\nFor this lack of shared prosperity, the allocation of corporate profits to stock buybacks bears considerable blame. From 2003 through 2012, 449 S&P 500 companies dispensed $54\\%$ of earnings, equal to $\\$2.4$ trillion, buying back their own stock, almost all through open-market repurchases. Dividends absorbed an additional $37\\%$ of earnings. Scant profits remained for investment in productive capabilities or higher incomes for hard-working, loyal employees.  \n\nLarge-scale open-market repurchases can give a manipulative boost to a company's stock price. Prime beneficiaries of stock-price increases are the very executives who decide the timing and amount of buybacks to be done. In 2012 the 500 highest paid executives named on proxy statements averaged remuneration of $\\$24.4$ million, With $52\\%$ coming from stock options and another $26\\%$ from stock awards. With ample stock-based pay, top corporate executives can gain from boosts in stock prices even when for most of the population economic progress is hard to find. If the United States is to achieve economic growth with an equitable income distribution and stable employment opportunities, government rule-makers and business decision-makers must take steps to bring both executive pay and stock buybacks under control.  \n\n### From \"retain-and-reinvest\" to\"downsize-and-distribute\"  \n\nNow, as was the case a century ago, large corporations dominate the U.s. economy. In 2012 the top 500 U.S. business corporations by revenue had $\\$12.1$ trillion in sales, $\\$804$ million in profits, and 26.4 million employees worldwide.1 How the executives of these companies decide to allocate resources has a preponderant influence on the productive capability of the economy and the distribution of the gains of economic growth among the labor force.  \n\nIn the post-World War II decades, the guiding principles of corporate resource allocation can be summed up as “retain-and-reinvest\".2 Business corporations retained earnings and reinvested them in productive capabilities, including first and foremost those of employees who, in helping to make the enterprise more productive and competitive, benefited in the form of higher incomes and more employment security. “Retain-and-reinvest\" is a resource-allocation regime that supports value creation at the business level and implements a process of value extraction through which the firm shares the gains of innovative enterprise with a broad base of employees. In doing so, the innovative enterprise can contribute to equitable and stable growth - or what I call \"sustainable prosperity\" - in the economy as a whole.3  \n\nFigure 1a below shows that until the late 1970s changes in real wages tracked changes in productivity in the U.S. economy. It was the retain-and-reinvest employment policies of major U.s. corporations that largely accounted for this result.4 In line with this movement, there was a trend toward greater income equality in the United States from the late 1940s well into the 1970s.  \n\nAs shown in Figure 1b, however, since the late 1970s there has been a widening gap between the growth in productivity and the growth in real wages. This gap, I would argue, is largely the result of a shift of corporate resource allocation to a “downsizeand-distribute\" regime in which corporate executives look for opportunities to downsize the labor force and distribute earnings to financial interests. Had corporate executives made different allocation decisions, some of the earnings that were paid out to shareholders could have been invested in, among other things, the productive capabilities of the people thrown out of work. Downsize-and-distribute is a resource-allocation regime that supports value extraction at the business level that may enrich financial interests at the expense of employees who contributed to the process of value creation that generated those earnings. As a result, a downsizeand-distribute allocation regime contributes to employment instability and income inequity.5  \n\n![](images/fd7f7daa6cebc038a7c2467e8fc9e891fb460c607c104ab864e74d7c457a62c7.jpg)  \nFigure 1a.

Cumulative annual percent changes in productivity and real wages in the United States,1963-2012   \nSource: http://www.econdataus.com/wagegap12.html  \n\nLazonick: Profits Without Prosperity  \n\nSince the beginning of the 1980s there have been three broad reasons for downsizing, which I summarize as “rationalization\", “marketization\", and 'globalization\".6 From the early 1980s, rationalization, characterized by permanent plant closings, eliminated the jobs of unionized blue-collar workers. From the early 1990s, marketization, characterized by the end of a career with one company as an employment norm that had prevailed at major U.S. corporations through the 1980s, placed the job security of middle-aged and older white-collar workers in jeopardy. From the early 2oo0s, globalization, characterized by the massive movement of employment offshore, left all members of the U.s. labor force, even those with advanced educational credentials and substantial work experience, vulnerable to displacement.  \n\nInitially, each of these structural transformations in employment relations could be justified as resource-allocation responses to major changes in industrial conditions related to technologies, markets, and competition. During the onset of rationalization in the early 1980s, the plant closings were a response to the superior productive capabilities of Japanese competitors in consumer durable and related capital goods industries that employed significant numbers of unionized blue-collar workers. During the onset of marketization in the early 1990s, the erosion of the one-company-career norm among white-collar workers was a response to the dramatic technological shift of the microelectronics revolution from proprietary systems to open systems that favored younger workers with, for example, the latest programming skills. And during the onset of globalization in the early 2oo0s, the acceleration in the offshoring of the jobs was a response to the emergence of large supplies of highly capable but lower-wage labor in developing nations such as China and India whose work in tasks that had become routine complemented the expansion of higher-value added work being done by labor in the United States.  \n\nOnce US corporations adopted these structural changes in employment, however, they often pursued these downsizing strategies purely for financial gain. Some companies closed manufacturing plants, terminated experienced (and generally more expensive) workers, and offshored production to low-wage areas of the world simply to increase profits, often at the expense of the companies' long-term competitive capabilities and without regard for displaced employees' long years of service. Moreover, as these changes became embedded in the structure of U.S. employment, business corporations failed to invest in new, higher-value-added job creation on a sufficient scale to provide a foundation for equitable and stable growth in the U.S. economy as a whole.  \n\nTo the contrary, with superior corporate performance defined as meeting Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings per share (EPS), companies turned to massive stock repurchases to “manage\" their own corporations' stock prices. Trillions of dollars that could have been spent on innovation and job creation in the U.S. economy over the past three decades have instead been used to buy back stock for the purpose of manipulating the company's stock price. Through their stockbased compensation, corporate executives who make these decisions are themselves beneficiaries of this focus on EPS and rising stock prices as the measures of corporate performance.  \n\nDividends, not buybacks, are the traditional mode of distributing corporate cash to shareholders. Until the 1980s academics, executives, and regulators debated what proportion of profits could be paid out as dividends while leaving sufficient retained earnings to fund the growth of the firm.7 Retained earnings could be used for investment in plant and equipment, R&D, and training of the labor force as well as higher pay, more stable employment, and better working conditions for employees - all of which had the potential to generate sufficient productivity gains so that over time these expenditures could actually augment the company's profits.  \n\nDuring the 1980s, the retain-and-reinvest mode of resource allocation came under attack through the Reagan-era deregulation, the hostile takeover movement, and the newfound ideology of “maximizing shareholder value\" (MsV). Embracing this new agenda, by the last half of the 1980s U.s. corporate executives became focused on using repurchases, in addition to dividends, as an important mode of distributing corporate profits to shareholders. Downsize-and-distribute became touted as an efficient mode of corporate resource allocation.  \n\nDividends provide shareholders with a yield for, as the name says, holding stock. In contrast, buybacks provide shareholders with a yield for selling stock; that is, for ceasing to be shareholders. Since the 1980s, the ratio of dividends to net income for all U.s. corporations rose from $37\\%$ in both the 1960s and 1970s to $46\\%$ in the 1980s to $58\\%$ in the 1990s to $63\\%$ in the 2000s.8  \n\nFigure 2 shows net equity issues of U.S. corporations from 1946 to 2013. Net equity issues are new corporate stock issues minus outstanding stock retired through stock repurchases and M&A activity. Since the mid-1980s in aggregate, corporations have funded the stock market rather than vice versa.9 Over the past decade net equity issues of non-financial corporations averaged - $\\$376$ billion per year.  \n\nThat buybacks are largely responsible for negative net equity issues is clear from the chart on the evolution of gross repurchases shown in Figure 3. For the 251 companies in the S&P 500 Index in January 2013 that were publicly listed back to 1981, the buyback payout ratio - that is, repurchases as a proportion of net income - was less than $5\\%$ in 1981-1983 but $39\\%$ in 2010-2012, with a three-year peak of $70\\%$ in 2006-2008. From the 1980s to the 1990s to the 2000s, the dividend payout ratio declined from $50\\%$ to $44\\%$ to $41\\%$ , while the buyback payout ratio rose from $22\\%$ to $35\\%$ to $50\\%$  \n\n![](images/19cb1f9a16b49b9b818a90684d158dab8e553d935b1a69ce82fcc8a56afdbf5e.jpg)  \nFigure 2.

This fact undermines one of the most oft-cited justifications for buybacks, namely that companies do them when their top executives view the stock as undervalued by the market. In 1999, at the peak of the New Economy boom, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Chairman Warren Buffett warned in his letter to shareholders that “repurchases are all the rage, but are all too often made for an unstated and, in our view, ignoble reason: to pump or support the stock price.\"10  \n\nThe vast majority of buybacks done since the mid-1980s have been open-market repurchases in which neither shareholders nor the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the federal government agency that is supposed to regulate the stock market, know the actual days on which top corporate executives have decided to repurchase the company's stock. In his 1999 letter to shareholders, Buffett argued that buybacks could be beneficial to the “continuing shareholder\" when done at below “intrinsic value\", when all shareholders “\"have been supplied all the information they need for estimating that value\". These types of repurchases are done as tender offers in which the company announces its intention to repurchase shares at a stipulated price. With the open-market repurchases that have predominated since the mid-1980s, however, only the top executives of the repurchasing company know the timing of the buybacks, creating the possibility that they might trade for their own benefit on this valuable inside information.  \n\n## The government regulator encourages market manipulation  \n\nOn November 17, 1982, the SEC promulgated Rule 10b-18, which gives a company a safe harbor against manipulation charges in doing open-market repurchases.11 The safe harbor states that a company will not be charged with manipulation if its buybacks on any single day are no more than $25\\%$ of the previous four weeks' average daily trading volume (ADTV). Under Rule 10b-18, moreover, there is no presumption of manipulation should the corporation's repurchases exceed the $25\\%$ ADTV limit.12  \n\nRule 10b-18 covers only open-market repurchases, which have been estimated to be as much as $90\\%$ of all buybacks, because it is in the open market that undetected stock-price manipulation can most easily occur. Private, off-market transactions such as tender offers are not regulated under the Rule. In 1982 the SEC also excluded “block trades\" (at or above $\\$200,000$ in value or numbering at least 5,000 shares with a minimum value of $\\$50,000$ ） from the $25\\%$ ADTV calculation, apparently because in the early 1980s block trades, although done on the open market, were viewed as exceptional. In a revision of Rule 10b-18 in 2003, however, the SEC included most block trades in the $25\\%$ ADTVcalculation.13  \n\nRule 1ob-18 requires companies to announce stock repurchase programs that have been approved by the board of directors. But it does not require disclosure of the particular days on which top corporate executives instruct the company's broker to execute actual buybacks. In its lack of disclosure, its $25\\%$ safe harbor limit, and the absence of a presumption of manipulation even when the $25\\%$ limit is exceeded, Rule 10b-18 is highly permissive of stock buybacks.  \n\nIn a 1984 article, “Issuer Repurchases\", Lloyd H. Feller, a former associate director of the SEC's Division of Market Regulation, and Mary Chamberlin, the then-current deputy chief counsel of that Division, called Rule 10b-18 a “regulatory about-face\" from previous SEC views on the detection and prevention of manipulation through open-market repurchases.14 Since the SEC's inception as a result of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the regulatory agency had sought to prevent stock-price manipulation by insiders and to require companies to disclose all material information to all stock-market investors. In 1955 the SEC adopted Rule 10b-6 to try to prevent an issuing company from manipulating its stock-price during a distribution of its stock, such as during a public stock offering or an M&A deal, or when it had convertible bonds or warrants outstanding. In the 1960s, the “go-go years\" of conglomeration and takeovers,15 the SEC sought to extend this antimanipulative regulation to open-market repurchases more generally, and not just when a company had a distribution in process.  \n\nThe result was Rule 13e-2, which emerged out of the Williams Act of 1968 (amending the Securities Exchange Act to require disclosure of information in cash tender offers) and made its first appearance in 1969. Rule 13e-2 was proposed, but never passed in 1970, 1973, and 1980. Rule 13e-2 emphasized disclosure of full information to investors to maintain the integrity of the stock market. In sharp contrast to Rule 10b-18, which in the “regulatory about-face\" was adopted in 1982, Rule 13e-2 would have put a $15\\%$ ADTV limit on open-market repurchases, required disclosure of the days on which buybacks were actually done, and have presumed that a company was manipulating the market if it exceeded the $15\\%$ ADTV limit. Whereas Rule 13e-2 proposed strong regulation of stock-price manipulation, Rule 10b-18 in effect gave corporations license to use open-market repurchases to manipulate the market.16  \n\nThis regulatory reversal was the result of the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan as U.S. President on a platform of government deregulation and his appointment in 1981 of John Shad, vice-chairman of the stock brokerage firm E. F. Hutton, to head the SEC. Shad had been the first Wall Street executive to back Reagan for President, and had served as head of fundraising in New York State for the Reagan campaign.17 Not since Joseph Kennedy had been the inaugural chair of the SEC in 1934-35 had a Wall Street executive led the agency.  \n\nA Wall Street Journal article on the adoption of Rule 10b-18 noted that “[t]he new, deregulation-minded commission, with its 3-2 majority of Reagan appointees, has been revamping many SEC policies.\" It went on to say that Shad hoped that buybacks would help to fuel increases in stock prices, and thus be beneficial to shareholders. The longest-serving SEC commissioner, John Evans, appointed by President Nixon in 1973, expressed concern that Rule 10b-18 represented deregulation of buybacks that could result in market manipulation. $^{18}\\mathrm{In}$ the end, however, Evans agreed to make the adoption of Rule 10b-18 unanimous.  \n\nThe 2003 amendment to Rule 10b-18 included block trades within the $25\\%$ safe harbor because, as the SEC stated in its release, “during the late 1990s, it was reported that many companies were spending more than half their net income on massive buyback programs that were intended to boost share prices - often supporting their share price at levels far above where they would otherwise trade.\" The SEC went on to warn that the unregulated use of block trades in doing buybacks could exacerbate “the potential for manipulative abuse\", and “mislead investors about the integrity of the securities trading market as an independent pricing mechanism.\"  \n\nIn seeking to rectify these problems, the 2003 amendment to Rule 10b-18 initiated quarterly reports on stock buybacks. But the SEC still did not require disclosure of the actual days on which buybacks were done so it could determine, without a special investigation, whether a company had in fact exceeded the $25\\%$ ADTVsafe harbor limit. And, given the escalation of buybacks after 2003, it is clear that the 2003 amendment did nothing to bring “the potential for manipulative abuse\" under control. For the 251 major U.S. corporations included in Figure 2 above, the repurchase payout ratio for 2005 through 2008 was $64\\%$ , far higher than the $45\\%$ it had been in 1997 through 2000, a period in which the SEC had viewed buybacks as possibly contributing to market manipulation. Compared with 1997-2000, the absolute value of buybacks in inflation-adjusted dollars was 2.2 times higher in  \n\n2005-2008 and 1.4 times higher in 2009-2012, a four-year period that includes the sharp fall in buybacks in 2o09 as a result of the financial crisis.  \n\nThe daily buybacks that are permissible within the $25\\%$ ADTV limit are sufficiently large to permit a company to manipulate its own stock price. Table 1 shows the top ten stock repurchasers for 2003-2012, and the proportions of net income that each company spent on buybacks and dividends over the decade. In most cases, total distributions to shareholders exceeded net income.  \n\nTable 1.

The daily buyback safeharbor limits for the next nine top repurchasers for 2003-2012 ranged from $\\$87$ million for Hewlett-Packard to $\\$309$ million for Microsoft. Apple Inc., which did $\\$22.9$ billion in buybacks in fiscal 2013, after having largely refrained from the practice during the reign of Steve Jobs, can, at the time of writing, do up to $\\$1.5$ billion per day while still availing itself of the safe harbor. Within the limits of the total value of buybacks set by a board-authorized repurchase program, Rule $10\\mathrm{b}\\cdot$ 18 permits buybacks of these manipulative magnitudes to be repeated trading day after trading day.  \n\n### Why do companies do buybacks?  \n\nThe reasons commonly given to justify open-market repurchases all defy facts and logic. As already mentioned, executives often claim that buybacks are financial investments in undervalued shares that signal confidence in the company's future as measured by its stock-price performance. But as we have seen, over the past two decades major US companies have tended to do buybacks in bull markets and cut back on them, often sharply, in bear markets.  \n\nLazonick: Profits Without Prosperity  \n\nIndeed, our research shows that companies that do buybacks never sell the shares at higher prices so that the corporation can cash in on these investments. To do so would be to signal to the market that the company's stock price had peaked, which no CFO would want to do. On the contrary, a company that has sold high in a boom is sometimes forced to sell low in a bust to alleviate financial distress. For example, in the first three quarters of 2o08 General Electric spent $\\$3.2$ billion on buybacks at an average price per share of $\\$31.84$ . Then, to protect its triple-A credit rating in the wake of the losses of GE Capital in the financial crisis, the company did a $\\$12.0$ billion stock issue in the last quarter of 2008 at an average price per share of $\\$23.25$  \n\nAnother argument for doing buybacks is that a mature company runs out of profitable investment opportunities, so it is time to return cash to shareholders. The first problem with this argument is that, typically, the shareholders to whom cash is being “returned\" never made investments in the value-creating assets of the company in the first place. For example, the only money that Apple Inc. has ever raised from public shareholders was $\\$97$ million at its IP0 in 1980.19 Recently, hedge-fund activists such as David Einhorn and Carl Icahn, who have invested no money in Apple's productive assets and have played absolutely no role in the company's success, have purchased large stakes on the stock market and have pressured the company to “unlock value\" for shareholders by doing the largest buyback programs in corporate history.  \n\nThe second problem with the “mature company\" argument for doing buybacks is that companies that have over decades accumulated productive capabilities typically have enormous organizational and financial advantages, known as \"dynamic capabilities\", for entering related product markets, either by setting up new divisions or spinning off new firms.20 The strategic function of top executives is to discover new opportunities for the productive use of these dynamic capabilities. When instead they opt to do large-scale open-market repurchases, these executives are in effect not doing their jobs.  \n\nA commonly stated reason for doing buybacks is to offset dilution of EPS when employees exercise stock options that are part of their compensation. As I have documented, the volume of open-market repurchases is generally a multiple of the volume of options that employees exercise.21 In any case, there is no logical economic rationale for doing repurchases to offset dilution from the exercise of employee stock options. The point of this mode of compensation is to motivate employees to work harder and smarter now for the sake of higher returns to the company in the future. Corporate executives should be willing to wait for higher EPS to materialize in the future as a result of employee work effort rather than use corporate cash to offset dilution to guarantee higher EPS right away. And if higher earnings do appear, the employees should gain by exercising their options, while the company can allocate the increased earnings to investment in the next round of innovation.  \n\nFinally, there is the argument put forward by agency theorists, most notably Michael C. Jensen, that says that public shareholders are the economic actors who are best positioned to allocate productive resources to their best alternative uses.22 But as I have shown in my work, this argument lacks a theory of the commitment of financial resources to innovative investment strategies.23 Retained earnings have always been the foundation for investment in innovation, the essence of which is collective and cumulative learning within business organizations. The argument that buybacks represent “free cash flow\", as agency theorists contend, is typically an excuse for avoiding investments in innovation.  \n\nMore than that, the theory that economic efficiency requires that corporate executives allocate resources to “maximize shareholder value\" (MsV) is fundamentally flawed. The argument for MsV assumes that shareholders are the only participants in the economy who bear risk by investing in the economy without a guaranteed return. Not so. Taxpayers through government agencies that invest in infrastructure and knowledge-creation and workers through the firms that employ them to engage in collective and cumulative learning make risky investments in productive capabilities on a regular basis, without guaranteed returns.24 As risk bearers, taxpayers whose dollars support business enterprises and workers whose efforts generate productivity improvements have claims on corporate profits if and when they occur. The irony of MsV is that the public shareholders whom agency theory holds up as the economy's only risk-bearers typically never invest in the value-creating capabilities of the company at all. Rather they invest in outstanding shares in the hope that they will rise in price on the market. And, following the directives of MsV, a prime way in which corporate executives fuel this hope is by doing large-scale buybacks to manipulate the market.  \n\nThe more one delves into the reasons for the huge increase in open-market repurchases since the mid-1980s, the clearer it becomes that the only plausible reason for this mode of resource allocation is that the very executives who make the buyback decisions have much to gain personally through their stock-based pay. For the decade 2003-2012, during which the ten largest repurchasers in Table 1 above did a combined $\\$859$ billion in buybacks, equal to $68\\%$ of their net income, the CEOs of these companies received an average of $\\$152$ million in compensation (ranging from $\\$14$ million at Microsoft to $\\$329$ million at Cisco), of which $24\\%$ was from stock options and $36\\%$ from stock awards. During this decade the other four highest paid at these ten companies received an average of $\\$95$ million in compensation, of which $25\\%$ came from stock options and $36\\%$ from stock awards. Meanwhile since 2003 the stock prices of only three of the ten largest repurchasers, Exxon Mobil, IBM, and Procter and Gamble, have outperformed the S&P 5o0 Index.  \n\n### Maximizing executive compensation  \n\nIn its release on the amendment to Rule 10b-18 in 2003, the SEC articulated clearly why it needs to get rid of Rule 10b-18. “In summary,\" wrote the SEC, “Rule 10b-18 is intended to protect issuer repurchases from manipulation charges when the issuer has no special incentive to interfere with the ordinary forces of supply and demand affecting its stock price. Therefore, it is not appropriate for the safe harbor to be available when the issuer has a heightened incentive to manipulate its share price.\"25  \n\nYet the stock-based pay of the executives who decide to do repurchases on any given day provides the issuer with \"a heightened incentive to manipulate its share price.\" As shown in Figure 4, from 1992 through 2012 for the 500 highest paid corporate executives named on proxy statements anywhere from $55\\%$ to $86\\%$ Oof their total remuneration was stock-based, mainly in the form of gains from exercising stock options but increasingly in the form of restricted stock awards that require the company to attain EPS targets.  \n\nGiven the fact that in the United States companies are not required to announce the dates on which they actually do open-market repurchases, there is an opportunity for top executives to do buybacks to benefit themselves. Buybacks can enable companies to hit quarterly EPS targets, with the manipulation invisible to the public. The manipulation of EPS can make executives look good to Wall Street, in some cases offsetting EPS declines that reflect “bad news\".26 And it can also directly pad their pay, as is often the case with restricted stock awards that are contingent on EPS performance.27  \n\nMoreover, top executives who are privy to the company's repurchasing activity can use this inside information to time their option exercises and stock sales to increase their pay. Indeed, in 1991 the SEC made it easier for top executives to do just that. Until 1991, Section 16(b) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act prevented top executives from reaping short-swing profits when they exercised their stock options by requiring that they wait at least six months before selling the acquired shares. In 1991, by arguing that a stock option is a derivative, the SEC determined that henceforth the six-month waiting period would begin at the grant date, not the exercise date. Since the option grant date is always at least one year before the option exercise date, this reinterpretation of Section 16(b) meant that top executives, as company insiders, could now sell the shares acquired from stock options immediately upon exercise.  \n\n![](images/e66a70393f5543ed9442de78e2b3d1a926f3ae4123f7e19ba743dfdb7f1927fd.jpg)  \nFigure 4.

Since corporate insiders could immediately sell the stock, they could qualify for loans from brokers that would enable them to exercise stock options without laying out their own cash. They would also no longer face the risk that the shares might decline in value during the holding period.\" 28 After the Section 16(b) reinterpretation went into effect in May 1991, a compensation consultant was quoted as saying that senior executives “now have an opportunity of making a decision of when to get in and out at the most propitious time.\"29  \n\nDo top executives actually trade on this inside information? We do not know because the SEC does not require that, even after the fact, companies disclose the days on which they have done open-market repurchases. What we do know is that, to paraphrase a 1960 Harvard Business Review article,30 executive compensation has gotten out of hand. Stock-based pay creates a strong incentive for corporate executives to orient themselves toward downsize-and-distribute rather than retain-and-reinvest. And since the 1980s downsize-and-distribute has been the clear-cut winner in the corporate resource-allocation game.  \n\n## How to put a stop to the buyback binge  \n\nThe problem is that corporate resource-allocation is not a game. It is our source of economic security or insecurity, as the case may be. If Americans want an economy in which corporate profits result in shared prosperity, the corporate buyback binge must be brought to an end. As with any addiction, the addicted will experience withdrawal pains. But the best corporate executives may actually derive considerable satisfaction from getting paid a reasonable salary for investing in their company's future rather than, as is typically the case now, an enormously excessive salary for living off someone else's past.  \n\nGiven the huge sums of money involved, it will require a regulatory authority - the U.S. government - to step in to control the behavior of those who are unable or unwilling to control themselves. In the case of buybacks, the regulatory authority is the SEC. \"The mission of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\", we are told on its website,\" is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.\"31 Yet, as we have seen, in its rulings on, and monitoring of, stock buybacks and executive pay going back over three decades, the SEC has taken a course of action contrary to these objectives. It has assisted financial interests, including top corporate executives, in capturing the lion's share of the gains of U.s. productivity growth while the vast majority of Americans have been left behind.32 The formulation of Rule 10b-18 and the interpretation of Section 16(b) have facilitated a rigged stock market while, by disgorging cash to shareholders, undermining capital formation, including, it must be stressed, human capital formation.  \n\nThe American public should demand that the federal government agency that is supposed to regulate the stock market rescind the “safe harbor\" that enables corporate executives to manipulate stock prices, secure in the knowledge that their actions are government tested and approved. More than that, let the SEC do a  \n\nLazonick: Profits Without Prosperity  \n\nSpecial Study, on the scale of its 1963 study of securities markets that resulted in the creation of NASDAQ,33 of the possible damage that open-market repurchases have done to the U.S. economy over the past three decades. The fact that the SEC has facilitated, and even encouraged, a mode of resource allocation in which trillions of dollars of corporate profits have been thrown away on buybacks indicates that there is a pressing need for a major rethinking about how the stock market functions, and indeed what functions we expect it to perform.34 The SEC may well be advised to make open-market repurchases illegal.  \n\nThe American public should also demand that the SEC restore the prohibition that existed from 1934 to 1991 against top executives as insiders reaping short-swing profits. Although this piece of regulation would not in and of itself prevent U.S. corporate executives from reaping what they have not sown, it could help launch a much-needed discussion in the United States of the meaningful reform of executive compensation that goes beyond the ineffectual ceremony of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act's“Say-on-Pay\".35  \n\nThat discussion would take up the need for changes in the composition of boards to include representatives willing and able to take a stand against excessive executive pay. Boards are currently dominated by other CEOs who have a strong bias toward ratifying higher pay packages for their peers. There is a urgent need to rekindle the conversation started by Graef Crystal's 1991 best-seller, In Search of Excess: The Overcompensation of the Corporate Executive, in which this well-known compensation expert showed how, to give cozy boards cover to ratchet up executive pay, CEOs hired the same group of compensation consultants to benchmark the pay of other CEOs in their interlocking directorship network. As we have seen, top executive pay is now about three times greater in real terms than it was in the early 1990s when Crystal sounded the alarm on the overcompensation of the American executive.  \n\nIn going beyond “Say-on-Pay\", the U.s. Congress might show the courage and independence of its predecessors in standing up to corporate executives who had taken advantage of government regulation to pad their pockets.36 In the Reform Act of 1950, corporate executives had been granted the right to be taxed at the $25\\%$ capital-gains rate when they exercised qualified stock options instead of at the personal-income rate, which on the top tax bracket was $91\\%$ . Subsequent to the 1960 publication of the Harvard Business Review article,\"Are Stock Options Getting Out of Hand,\" by Harvard Law School Dean Ervin Griswold, Senator Albert Gore (DTennessee) launched a campaign through which Congress whittled away at the  \n\nLazonick: Profits Without Prosperity  \n\nspecial tax advantages that had been accorded executive stock options.37 After the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Graef Crystal was able to declare that stock options that qualified for the capital-gains tax rate, “once the most popular of all executive compensation devices,.have been given the last rites by Congress.\"38 It also happens that the 1970s was the period over the last century in which the share of thetop $0.1\\%$ of households of all U.S. income was at its lowest.39  \n\nFinally, in carrying out reforms of corporate resource allocation and executive pay, it must be recognized that in repurchasing stock and jacking up their own stockbased income, corporate executives have been doing exactly what agency theorists in leading business schools have been telling them to do: disgorge the so-called \"free\" cash flow and incentivize themselves to “maximize shareholder value\" by gorging themselves on stock-based pay.40 Yet, like neoclassical economic theory, from which it is derived, agency theory lacks a theory of innovative enterprise.41 It poses as a theory of value creation, when in fact it can only contemplate value extraction.  \n\nThe deeper intellectual problem, as I have argued elsewhere, is the adherence of neoclassical economists, conservative and liberal alike, to the “myth of the market economy\".42 It is time for the economics profession to get serious about constructing a theory of the relation between resource allocation and economic performance that can comprehend the evolution and operation of the business corporation. Only then, in my view, can \"new economic thinking\" become a positive force in the quest for stable and equitable economic growth.  "

We measure incentives as the increase in an institution's management fees when a stockholding increases $1\\%$ in value, considering both the direct effect on assets under management and the indirect effect on subsequent fund flows. In 2017, the average institution gains an extra \\$129,000 in annual cash flow if a stock in its portfolio rises $1\\%$ .The estimates range from $\\$19,600$ for institutions’ investments in small firms to $\\$307,400$ for their investments in large firms. Institutional shareholders in one firm often gain when the firm's competitors in the industry do well, by virtue of institutions’ holdings in those firms, but the impact of common ownership is modest in the most concentrated industries.  \n\n# 1 Introduction  \n\nThis paper studies institutional investors? financial incentives to be engaged shareholders. Institutional ownership of publicly traded U.S. firms rose from $32\\%$ to $73\\%$ of the overall market from 1980-2017, according to 13F filings with the SEC, and the 100 largest institutions now own more than $50\\%$ of ll equity.  This shift in ownership has the potential to substantially affect the governance of public firms if institutional investors have different incentives than other shareholders.  \n\nInstitutions have traditionally been viewed as passive owners, raising concerns that their growth will weaken governance and exacerbate agency problems (Bebchuk, Cohen, and Hirst 2017). However, recent studies provide evidence that larger institutions often exercise ‘voice’ through proxy voting and behind-the-scenes engagement with management (Carleton, Nelson, and Weisbach 1998; McCahery, Sautner, and Starks 2016; Appel, Gormley, and Keim 2016). A controversial strand of the literature argues that institutions who invest in several firms in the same industry may discourage product-market competition, either by shaping managerial incentives or advocating less aggressive corporate policies (Anton et al. 2020; Azar, Schmalz, and Tecu 2018; Azar, Raina, and Schmalz 2019). Yet it remains unclear how extensive institutional intervention is or, at a more basic level, whether institutions have strong incentives to be engaged. The answer to the latter question is complicated by the fact that institutions compete with each other and tend to be evaluated based on relative performance. Engagement by one institution will benefit other shareholders with whom it competes for funds, likely exacerbating the classic free-rider problem in corporate governance discussed by Grossman and Hart (1980) and Shleifer and Vishny (1986).  \n\nOur paper contributes to the literature by providing direct evidence on institutions? financial incentives to be engaged shareholders. We propose a simple framework to measure incentives that accounts for externalities among institutions and use this framework to estimate incentives for different types of institutions and firms. We also analyze how the payoffs of institutional shareholders of one firm are linked to the value of other firms in the industry to shed light on the potential impact of common ownership, accounting for the fact that rivals are cross-owned not only by the institution itself (similar to prior literature) but also owned by competing institutions. The latter effect has not been previously examined.  \n\nOur analysis is based on a simple framework: we measure incentives as the impact of a $1\\%$ increase in firm value on an institution's management fees. Incentives are the sum of a direct component that captures how a change in firm value affects assets under management (AUM) and management fees, and an indirect (flow) component that captures the impact on an institution's relative performance and subsequent fund flows. Analogous to Jensen and Murphy (1990) and Hall and Liebman (1998), we define overall incentives as either the percent or dollar increase in cash flow caused by a $1\\%$ increase in firm value.  \n\nIntuitively, direct incentives depend simply on the size of an institution's investment in the firm. Indirect incentives depend on whether the institution under- or overweights a firm relative to competing institutions and how strongly flows respond to institutions? relative performance.  \n\nOur sample consists of all institutions with 13F filings. The sample grows from just under 500 institutions in 1980, with an average portfolio of 180 stocks worth $\\$2.5$ billion (in 2017 dollars), to 3,800 institutions in 2017, with an average portfolio of 210 stocks worth $\\$5.5$ billion. The size distribution becomes more skewed over time and, by the end of the sample, five institutions alone—Fidelity, Capital Group, State Street, Blackrock, and Vanguard—account for over $25\\%$ of total AUM.  \n\nOur first step is to estimate the flow-to-performance sensitivity for institutional investors. We find that a one percentage point increase in an institution's quarterly return predicts a highly significant 1.39 percentage point increase in net inflow over the subsequent 12 quarters. This estimate implies that flows contribute significantly to institutions’ incentives and extends the literature on flow-to-performance sensitivities for mutual funds (e.g., Chevalier and Ellison 1997; Sirri and Tufano 1998).  \n\nFor our main results, we measure direct and flow incentives for every stock in an institution's portfolio, then average over all institutions holding a stock to get an estimate of incentives for a given firm or average over an institution's holdings to get an estimate of incentives for a given institution. In both cases, we value-weight incentives, so that larger shareholdings receive a greater weight. In some tests, we also consider the incentives of just a firm's largest shareholders.  \n\nDirect and flow incentives are both important and have increased in recent years. In 2017, a typical stockholding represents $1.56\\%$ of an institution's portfolio, compared with a weight of $0.44\\%$ in the portfolio held by other institutions.2 The weight of $1.56\\%$ determines an institution’s direct incentives, while the overweight relative to other institutions, $1.12\\%$ , determines flow incentives. With a flow-to-performance sensitivity of 1.39, total incentives can be expressed as $3.12\\%$ $1.56\\%+1.39{\\times}1.12\\%$ ), equal to the percentage increase in an institution's AUM and management fees if a typical stockholding doubles in value.  \n\nTo measure incentives in dollar terms, we need to estimate the dollar level of management fees. If we assume that fees equal $0.5\\%$ of AUM, a $1\\%$ increase in a typical stockholding leads to an extra $\\$236,300$ in an annual cash flow (direct incentives of $\\$12300$ plus flow incentives of $\\$61,600$ 0.Alternatively, if we use mutual fund data to proxy for how fees vary with an institution's size and investment approach, we estimate that a $1\\%$ increase in firm value leads to $\\$123,000$ in additional fees (direct incentives of $\\$84,400$ plus flow incentives of \\$44,600).3 These numbers can be interpreted as the annual cost that an institution would be willing to incur to bring about a certain one-time, $1\\%$ increase in firm value. (The total amount an institution would be willing to spend, equal to the present value of the stream of additional management fees, would be roughly an order of magnitude larger.) The estimates suggest that, despite the free-rider problems in corporate governance, many institutions would be willing to spend significant resources monitoring and engaging with firms if they expect engagement to have at least a modest impact on value.  \n\nTo put the numbers in perspective, we also estimate the incentives of activist investors who, through 13D filings, explicitly indicate an intention to influence the firm.  These estimates provide a benchmark for evaluating how strong incentives need to be to make engagement worthwhile. Activists take large positions in firms and have stronger incentives on average (in part because of their higher fees), but their incentives are often comparable to those of other institutions. For example, we estimate that a $1\\%$ increase in firm value leads to an  average annualized  gain  of $\\$520,400$ for activist investors, with an interquartile spread of \\$119,700-\\$732,600, based on a sample of 13D filings from 2015-2017.  \n\nIncentives vary substantially across stocks and institutions. Small institutions invest an average of $4.11\\%$ of AUM in a given firm, leading to incentives that are strong on a percentage basis $(9.32\\%)$ even though they are modest in dollar terms (\\$31,300). In contrast, large institutions tend to be more diversified, investing just $0.73\\%$ of AUM in an average stockholding. Their incentives are lower in percentage terms, but, given their size, a $1\\%$ increase in firm value  leads  to an extra $\\$219,500$ in annual cash flow (using an estimated management fee of $0.36\\%$ for large institutions).  \n\nThe growth of index funds and ETFs has an interesting effect on institutional incentives. Institutions with large indexed portfolios—Schwab, Dimensional, State Street, Blackrock, and Vanguard—make large dollar investments, which, all else equal, provide stronger incentives to be engaged. On the other hand, these institutions charge lower management fees and, therefore, receive a smaller portion of any increase in firm value compared with other institutions. The net effect is that, for the five institutions above, a $1\\%$ increase in the value of a typical stockholding leads to an extra $\\$133,000$ in annual management fees (based on an estimated management fee of $0.11\\%$ in 2017).  \n\nWe also study incentives at the firm level, averaging across a firm's institutional shareholders, to understand how strong the incentives are for a given firm's shareholders to engage with management. For large stocks, a typical share (in 2017) is held by an institution that invests $2.47\\%$ of its portfolio in the firm. Direct and flow incentives together imply that the average institutional shareholder gains $\\$307,600$ in annual cash flow if firm value increases $1\\%$ . For small stocks, a $1\\%$ increase in firm value leads to dollar gains of just $\\$19,600$ ; the incentives to intervene are lower, though the costs of engagement could be lower as well.  \n\nFinally, following the recent literature on cross-ownership among firms in the same industry, we quantify how much institutional shareholders in one firm gain if rival firms in the industry increase in value, by virtue of the institutions? holdings of those firms (taking into account both direct and flow incentives). We focus primarily on industries with a small number of firms or high sales concentration to highlight the potential impact on competition when strategic interactions are more likely to be important. For these industries, rival incentives are positive but typically smaller than own-firm incentives. For example, in industries with 2-6 firms, the average institutional shareholder in one firm gains $\\$78,100$ in additional fees if that firm goes up $1\\%$ in value but $\\$31,400$ in annual cash flow if every competitor goes up $1\\%$ (institutions often invest in multiple firms in an industry but, when they overweight one firm, they tend not to overweight other firms in the industry). The latter number equals $\\$8,100$ per rival firm. To put the numbers in perspective, consider a corporate action that would increase the value of a firm at the expense of industry rivals, one-for-one (for example, a move that allows the firm to take market share away from its rivals). Our estimates suggest that institutions? ownership of multiple firms in an industry makes this strategy about $30\\%$ less valuable for most institutional shareholders than it otherwise would be and $73\\%$ less valuable for the five large indexers, for which common ownership is more important. We find similar results using other concentration measures and either SIC-based or HobergPhillips (2010, 2016) industries.  \n\nOur findings contribute to the large literature on the governance role of institutional investors. The literature suggests that institutions influence various corporate policies, including CEO pay, investment, takeovers, board structure, and, more controversially, output prices (Bushee 1998; Gillan and Starks 2000; Hartzell and Starks 2003; Aggarwal et al. 2011; Aghion, Van Reenen, and Zingales 2013; Fich, Harford, and Tran 2015; He and Huang 2017; Azar, Schmalz, and Tecu 2018; Azar, Raina, and Schmalz 2019; Koch, Panayides, and Thomas 2020; Lewellen and Lowry 2020). However, active involvement requires an institution to spend resources to monitor the firm, engage managers, and vote on shareholder proposals, all of which have an uncertain payoff and success rate. Our results estimate institutions’ potential benefits from taking these actions, but more work is needed to understand the costs of engagement, the probability that engagement is successful, and the value consequences of successful engagement.  \n\nOur paper also contributes to the literature on flow-to-performance effects in asset management, which typically focuses on individual mutual funds (e.g., Chevalier and Ellison 1997; Sirri and Tufano 1998). While a few papers explore interactions among funds within a family (Nanda, Wang, and Zhang 2004; Brown and Wu 2016), we provide the first estimate of the fund-to-performance sensitivity for institutional investors overall. The relation is statistically and economically large, and the implied competition for funds contributes significantly to institutions? financial incentives.  \n\n# 2 Framework  \n\nThe goal of the paper is to study the incentives that institutional investors have to be active shareholders: What is an institution's payoff from taking an action—-monitoring the firm, engaging with management, voting on shareholder proposals, etc.—that affects firm value? An oft-stated view in the literature is that many, if not most, institutions have little incentive to be involved in corporate governance, but to our knowledge no one has explicitly estimated the payoffs from being active.  \n\nOur approach focuses on the additional fees an institution earns if a stockholding increases in value, recognizing both the direct impact on AUM when the stock goes up and the indirect impact from performancerelated fund flows. To be specific, suppose the institution earns an annual fee equal to a given percentage $p$ Oof AUM, where AUM at the end of period $t{+}I$ equals:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{A U M_{t+1}=A U M_{t}*\\left(1+\\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_{i,t}R_{i,t+1}\\right)+F l o w_{t+1}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$R_{i,t+1}$ is stock i's return in period $t{+}l,w_{i,t}$ is the stock's weight in the institution's portfolio at the start of $^{t+1}$ ， and $F l o w_{t+1}$ represents the net inflow of new money in period $t{+}I$ . Our empirical analysis allows Flow to react with a delay to performance but, for expositional simplicity, suppose that it is linked to contemporaneous returns relative to a benchmark:  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{F l o w_{t+1}=A U M_{t}*\\big[\\alpha+\\beta*\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_{i,t}R_{i,t+1}-\\sum_{i=1}^{N}v_{i,t}R_{i,t+1}\\right)+e_{t+1}\\big],}\\end{array}$ (2) where $\\beta$ is the flow-to-performance sensitivity and $v_{i}$ is the weight of stock $i$ in the benchmark portfolio. From eqs. (1) and (2), the incentives to increase stock $i^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}$ value in a given year come from a direct component, stemming from the additional fees associated an increase in AUM:  \n\nand a flow component coming from the incremental fund inflows driven by improved performance:  \n\nAn implicit assumption here is that Flow reacts the same to all sources of relative performance, whether from luck, stock-picking skill, engagement activities, etc. This would be true, for example, if investors observe the institution’s return but not underlying cause. In addition, eqs. (3) and (4) consider the impact on fees if a single stock changes in value, holding constant the value of other stocks. Our measure of ‘rival incentives, described below, considers how incentives change if engagement affects a firm's competitors, but the analysis does not encompass any potential impact on a firm’s customers or suppliers. Those effects could be important if institutions invest in multiple firms in the supply chain.  \n\nEqs. (3) and (4) express incentives as the dollar increase in management fees of a $100\\%$ increase in stock i's value. Empirically, we divide by 100 to calculate the dollar impact of a $1\\%$ increase in stock i's value, which strikes us as a more appropriate magnitude to consider. In addition, since $p^{*}A U M$ is the level of management fees, we can drop that term from the formulas to express incentives on a percentage basis.  \n\nOur incentive measures are analogous to Hall and Liebman's (1998) measures of CEO incentives, representing an institution's gain from a percentage increase in firm value. We consider percentage changes in firm value, rather than dollar changes, because policies that affect value roughly in proportion to a firm's size (such as governance or strategic issues) seem the most likely to attract institutional attention.  \n\nOne interpretation of dollar incentives is that they give an upper bound on the annualized cost the institution would be willing to incur to bring about a certain $1\\%$ increase in value. (The total amount the institution would be willing to spend is given by the present value of the stream of additional fees, but we leave the numbers as annual cash flows for simplicity.) These costs might stem from the extra time, effort, and legal expenses needed to monitor the firm and engage with management. An important point is that we focus on the incentives of the money manager itself—-how much the manager would be willing to spend out-of-pocket—-not the incentives of the institution's clients, who would benefit from the entire increase in AUM rather than just the increase in $p^{*}\\mathrm{AUM}$ . This distinction is important because it is not always clear who actually bears the costs of engagement. In mutual funds, for example, some costs are paid directly by the management company while other costs are charged to the fund as an operating expense. The latter arrangement would seem to better align the money manager's and clients? interests, since the manager would have an incentive to spend until the net benefit to investors is zero, but, anecdotally at least, engagement costs often seem to be borne directly by the mutual fund company (see, e.g., Pozen 1994). In a similar vein, it is important to note that we focus on the incentives of the management company, not of individual funds. Individual funds could have conflicting interests in some circumstances, but we abstract from those issues to highlight the potential gains to the management company itself.4  \n\nThe framework is easily extended to consider issues related to common ownership. Recent studies emphasize that institutions often invest in many firms in an industry, providing an incentive to support policies that benefit the industry as a whole (possibly at the expense of consumers). We measure these incentives very simply by calculating how institutional shareholders in firm $i$ are affected by changes in the value of firm i's competitors. Concretely, we calculate ‘rival incentives? for stock $i$ by summing our incentive measures over other firms in the same industry:  \n\nWwhere $j$ indexes other firms in the industry $(j\\neq i)$ . Rival incentives are higher if the institution invests more within the industry and depend, in part, on the holdings of competing institutions $(\\nu_{j})$ . Total rival incentives (the sum of eqs. 5 and 6) can be negative if an institution has modest cross-holdings within the industry if an action benefits other institutional shareholders of rival firms more. This situation is observed often in our data, providing a counterweight to the incentives of some institutions to support anticompetitive policies. These rival flow incentives have not been previously incorporated into analyses of common ownership.5  \n\n# 3 Data  \n\nOur main data come from Thomson Reuters′ database of 13F filings with the SEC. Since 1980, the SEC has required institutional investors that ‘exercise investment discretion over $\\$100$ million or more² of so-called 13(f) securities to report, with some exceptions, their holdings of U.S. stocks and other exchange-traded securities every quarter. Holdings are identified by CUSIP, allowing an easy merge with price and share data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP).  \n\nThomson Reuters classifies institutions as (i) banks, (i) insurance companies, (i) investment companies, (iv) investment advisors, or (v) other. The distinction between the last three categories is somewhat arbitrary, and Thomson Reuters mistakenly misclassified many institutions as ^other? starting in 1998 (see Wharton Research Data Services’ (WRDS) User Guide for details). To circumvent these issues, we combine the last three categories into a single group-‘Type $\\backepsilon$ institutions—that includes mutual fund companies, hedge funds, pensions, endowments, and other asset managers.  \n\nWe make four additional changes to Thomson Reuters? data. First, to mitigate a potential problem related to split adjustments in the data (see WRDS’ User Guide), we adjust holdings for stock splits that occur between the ‘filing? and ‘report dates using CRSP's adjustment factors. Second, WRDS documents serious problems with the data starting in the second quarter of 2013 caused by stale and omitted 13F filings. As a fix, WRDS provides a supplemental dataset for June 2013-December 2017 based on institutions’ original 13F filings with the SEC. We clean these data and merge them by hand with Thomson Reuters (see the Appendix for details). Third, we aggregate (separately) the holdings of Blackrock and Capital Group, which Thomson Reuters reports under multiple entities (see also Ben-David et al. 2018). We also download from EDGAR two quarters of 13F data for Blackrock (March and June 2010) that are missing from Thomson Reuters. Finally, we set institutional ownership to $100\\%$ of shares outstanding in the small number of cases that institutions appear to hold more than $100\\%$ of the firm (see Lewellen 2011 for details).  \n\nTable 1 reports descriptive statistics for the data, breaking the sample into various subperiods from 1980-2017   \nto show how the sample evolves through time.6  \n\nPanels A and B describe the cross section of institutions. The sample grows from 540 institutions in the early 1980s to 3,648 institutions in the period 2015-2017 (in these panels, N’ is the number of institutions in the sample). The average institution in all periods holds roughly 200-250 U.S. firms, with a portfolio worth $\\$2.4$ billion in the early 1980s and $\\$5.3$ billion in recent years (in 2017 dollars).  Interestingly, the median institution actually shrinks by about half from 1980 to 2017, ending with a portfolio of 76 stocks worth $\\$302$ million in the final subperiod. The different trends for the mean vs. median reflect the fact that institutions' size distribution becomes more skewed over time, with dramatic growth in the top AUM percentiles (AUM here is measured by an institution's holding of U.S. stocks). For example, the 99th AUM percentile grows four-fold over the sample, from $\\$18.5$ billion in the early 1980s to $\\$76.0$ billion in 2015-2017. This rise in large institutional investors with widespread stockholdings has led to concerns about the competitive effects of common ownership.  \n\nPanels C and D summarize the distribution of institutional ownership across U.S. firms (here, “N’ represents the number of firms in the sample). The average firm at the beginning of the sample has 19 institutional shareholders who own $12\\%$ of shares outstanding, steadily increasing to 186 institutional shareholders who own $58\\%$ of shares in the period 2015-2017. (On a value-weighted basis, the average firm has more than 1,000 institutional shareholders at the end of the sample, holding $73\\%$ of the firm's shares.) Nearly every firm has at least one institutional shareholder in recent years.  \n\n# 4 Flow-to-performance sensitivity  \n\nAn increase in the value of an institution's stockholdings has both a direct impact on AUM and an indirect effect via relative performance and subsequent flows. We estimate the latter effect—the flow-to-performance sensitivity of institutions--in this section.  \n\n## 4.1 Background  \n\nA large literature studies how mutual fund flows respond to past performance. For example, Chevalier and Ellison (1997) estimate that a two-year-old fund grows 45 percentage points faster, $55\\%$ Vs. $10\\%$ , if its excess return in the prior year increases from $0\\%$ to $10\\%$ implying a flow-to-performance sensitivity of 4.5. Flow-toperformance sensitivities are smaller for older funds, close to zero for poorly-performing funds, and strong for the best-performing funds (implying nonlinearities in the relation).  \n\nA few recent studies explore growth within fund families, though we are not aware of any study that directly estimates flow-to-performance sensitivities at the family level. Nanda, Wang, and Zheng (2004) show that the existence of a ‘star’ fund is positively related to the growth of affiliated funds (see also Khorana and Servaes 1999; Massa 2003; Gaspar, Massa, and Matos 2006; Sialm and Tham 2016). Brown and Wu (2016) argue that flows respond to the performance of other funds in the family because their returns provide information about the quality of shared resources (see also Choi, Kahraman, and Mukherjee 2016). How strongly these effects show up at the family level depends on whether new flows into a fund come from within the family or from competing institutions.  \n\n## 4.2Flow-to-performance estimates  \n\nWe estimate institutions? flow-to-performance sensitivity by regressing net inflow on past benchmark-adjusted returns, allowing for a delay in the arrival of new money. Quarterly net inflow equals the growth rate of AUM minus the institution's quarterly portfolio return:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{N e t I n f l o w_{i t}=\\frac{A U M_{i t}-A U M_{i,t-1}(1+R_{i t})}{A U M_{i,t-1}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $R_{i t}$ is inferred from the institution's holdings at the end of quarter $_{t-1}$ . The predictor variable, an institution's benchmark-adjusted return, equals $R_{i t}$ minus the value-weighted return of all institutions of the same type, capturing the idea that investors are more likely to evaluate an institution's performance relative to similar institutions (the results only change slightly using raw returns).?7  \n\nTable 2 shows that flow is strongly related to prior performance. In Panel A, we regress flow in quarters $^{t+1}$ through $t{+}12$ on benchmark-adjusted returns in quarter $t$ .The slopes are significantly positive for all 12 quarters, with the strongest effects observed in quarters $t{+}2$ through $t{+}4$ (slopes of 0.18-0.21). The cumulative flow-to-performance sensitivity over 12 quarters, 1.37, implies that a $1\\%$ return in quarter $t$ leads to an immediate $1\\%$ increase in AUM followed by an additional $1.37\\%$ increase in AUM in the subsequent three years as new money is received (the t-statistics in the table take into account possible correlation between the slopes at different horizons using an approach similar to Jegadeesh and Titman 1993). The quarterly slopes become insignificant after three years and the cumulative flow-to-performance sensitivity grows only slightly, to 1.41, if we extend the horizon out to 16 quarters. The results are comparable to those reported by Chevalier and Ellison (1997) for older mutual funds.  \n\nA potential concern with the estimates in Panel A is that the cumulative flow at horizon $t{+}\\mathbf{k}$ reflects not only the impact of returns in quarter $t$ but also the impact of returns in $t{+}1,.{\\ldots},t{+}\\mathrm{k}{-}1$ , which might be correlated with the return in quarter $t$ if performance is persistent. That effect is subtly different than the effect we are trying to measure, which is how flow responds to a one-time increase in value. As a robustness check, in Panel B, we regress flow on all 12 lags of quarterly returns simultaneously, to isolate the impact of each quarter's return controlling for performance in other quarters (the slope on the kth lag is reported under horizon $\\overline{{\\mathbf{\\Psi}}}t+\\mathbf{k}\\overline{{\\mathbf{\\Psi}}}$ , in a slight abuse of notation). The slopes are very similar to the simple-regression estimates, with a cumulative flow-to-performance sensitivity of 1.39.  \n\nFigure 1 ilustrates the shape of the flow-to-performance relation for institutions. We sort institutions into relative-performance quintiles each quarter and plot the quintiles’ net inflow over the subsequent 12 quarters against their relative returns. The graph provides some evidence of convexity in the relation, mirroring results for mutual funds, but the effect is not dramatic.  \n\nIt is interesting to note that flow-to-performance sensitivities vary across institutional types (not tabulated). The relation is weakest for the small number of insurance companies in the data (38 institutions per quarter with a flow-to-performance sensitivity of just 0.47), and strongest for ^Type $\\backepsilon$ institutions that include investment companies, investment advisors, and other asset managers (1,396 institutions per quarter with a flow-to-performance sensitivity of 1.59). This suggests that the flow incentives we document below might overstate incentives for banks and insurance companies but understate incentives for Type 3 institutions (which have more than $80\\%$ of total AUM in recent years). However, there is no reason to believe that average incentives across all institutions would be biased.  \n\nPerhaps surprisingly, flow-to-performance sensitivities do not seem to depend on an institution's size. In particular, our estimates are similar if the regressions include only institutions that make up the top $75\\%$ Of total AUM (cumulative slope of 1.50) or just the 100 largest (cumulative slope of 1.61) or 50 largest (cumulative slope of 1.45) institutions each quarter. In all three cases, the flow-to-performance sensitivity is not significantly different for institutions above and below the cutoff, with t-statistics of 0.30-1.65 on interaction terms added to full-sample regression.  \n\n# 5 Institutions’ incentives  \n\nAs described in Section 2, we measure an institution's incentive to be an active shareholder as its payoff from $1\\%$ increase in the firm's value. The payoff comes from an increase in management fees when AUM rises, considering both the direct increase in AUM if a holding does well (direct incentives) and the indirect impact on relative performance and subsequent flow (flow incentives). Our estimates of flow incentives are based on the flow-to-performance sensitivity of 1.39 in Panel B of Table 2.  \n\nPercent incentives depend on a firm's porfolio weight, while dollar incentives also depend on the level of management fees, which are not observable. For simplicity, our baseline measure assumes an annual management fee equal to $0.5\\%$ of AUM for all institutions, close to the average advisory fee of U.S. equity mutual funds during the sample (e.g., Rawson and Johnson 2015).  \n\nThe baseline can be scaled up or down to reflect alternative assumptions about average fees, but a limitation is that it does not account for variation across institutions. A second approach is to use data on mutual fund fees, available on CRSP since 1999, to approximate how fees vary with an institution's size and investment approach (we cannot merge the datasets directly because CRSP only has mutual funds). To be specific, we estimate percentage management fees for five groups of institutions: a group of institutions with large index funds—Schwab, Dimensional, State Street, Blackrock, and Vanguard—and four non-indexer size quartiles, each with $25\\%$ of (remaining) AUM. We match institutions in the index group and top size quartile directly to fund companies on CRSP to estimate their management fees (if we cannot match, we use the average fee for other institutions in the group as a proxy). For smaller institutions, we use the average management fee for fund-company size quartiles as a proxy for the management fees of institution size quartiles (the group's average fee in 1999-2002 is used for earlier years). Average management fees using this approach trend downward from $0.60\\%$ in the early 2000s to $0.45\\%$ in 2017 and are lower for large institutions and indexers. The estimates vary over time from $0.70{-}0.78\\%$ for small institutions, $0.61{-}0.69\\%$ for quartile 2, $0.47{-}64\\%$ for quartile $3,0.36{-}0.49\\%$ for quartile 4, and $0.11{-}0.24\\%$ for indexers.  \n\n## 5.1 Institution-level incentives  \n\nTo begin, Table 3 looks at incentives measured at the institution level: we estimate incentives for each firm in an institution's portfolio and calculate the value-weighted average across holdings.α  The table summarizes the cross-sectional distribution of these institution-level estimates, with institutions weighted equally in Panel A and weighted by AUM in Panel B. The table focuses on 2015-2017 since recent years are probably the most interesting, but results for other time periods are reported later.  \n\nConsider, first, percentage incentives. Many institutions hold fairly concentrated portfolios, with the average stockholding equal to $5.71\\%$ of AUM when we equal-weight institutions and $1.59\\%$ of AUM when we valueweight institutions (these numbers equal %Incentives_Direct in the table). The weights are much higher than the same stock's weight in the benchmark portfolio held by other institutions of the same type, $0.35\\%$ on an equal-weighted basis and $0.39\\%$ on a value-weighted basis (not tabulated). Thus, if a stock held by an institution doubles in value, the equal-weighted average institution realizes a direct $5.71\\%$ increase in AUM plus an additional $7.45\\%$ increase due to higher subsequent flow( $1.39{\\times}(5.71\\%{-}0.35\\%)$ ),implying total percentage incentives of $13.16\\%$ . For the value-weighted average institution, a doubling in firm value leads to a $1.59\\%$ direct increase in AUM and an additional $1.68\\%$ increase due to subsequent flow ( $1.39\\times(1.59\\%-$ $0.39\\%)$ ), implying total percentage incentives of $3.27\\%$  \n\nTo express the numbers in dollar terms, we multiply percent incentives by our estimates of annual management fees (as described above) and divide by 100, so that dollar incentives represent the increase in management fees from a $1\\%$ increase in firm value.  \n\nMeasured this way, incentives seem fairly small for the majority of institutions, reflecting their modest size. Focusing on our second approach for estimating fees, a $1\\%$ increase in firm value leads to an additional \\$11,000 in annual management fees for the equal-weighted average institution (direct incentives of \\$5,200 plus flow incentives of \\$5,900). However, incentives vary substantially across institutions—the cross-sectional standard deviation is $\\$47,700$ —and tend to be much stronger for larger institutions. On a value-weighted basis, a $1\\%$ increase in firm value leads to an average increase of \\$112,600 in annual management fees, 10 times larger than the equal-weighted average, and a quarter of total AUM is held by institutions with incentives greater than $\\$150,200$ (the value-weighted 75th percentile of dollar incentives). Again, these incentives can be interpreted as the maximum an institutional investor would be willing to spend annually to bring about a onetime, $1\\%$ increase in the value of a stockholding.  \n\nFigure 2 looks more explicitly at the incentives of small, medium, and large institutions. We sort institutions into the five groups described earlier, representing a group of large ‘indexers′ plus four value-weighted size quartiles. The small quartile (Q1) includes the majority of institutions (3,469) with average AUM of \\$1.1 billion, while the large quartile (Q4) includes just the 10 largest, non-index institutions with average AUM of \\$398.1 billion. (The indexers—Schwab, Dimensional, State Street, Blackrock, and Vanguard—have average AUM of $\\$8$ billion.) For brevity, we report dollar incentives using only the approach that allows management fees to vary across groups. Percentage fees equal $0.73\\%$ $0.64\\%$ $0.54\\%$ , and $0.38\\%$ for quartiles 1-4 and $0.15\\%$ for indexers during this period.  \n\nNot surprisingly, incentives vary substantially across groups. Small institutions invest an average of $4.05\\%$ of their portfolios in a given firm, compared with a weight of just $0.32\\%$ in the benchmark portfolio. Thus, on a percentage basis, overall incentives for small institutions are strong, with direct incentives of $4.05\\%$ and flow incentives of $5.18\\%$ $(1.39\\times(4.05\\%-0.32\\%)$ ). In dollar terms, average direct incentives equal \\$12,900 and average flow incentives equal \\$16,300, implying that a small institution's annual cash flow increases by an $\\$29,200$ if a stockholding goes up $1\\%$ Small institutions benefit directly from an increase in a stock's value but even more from its impact on relative performance and subsequent flow.  \n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the largest non-index institutions invest, on average, $0.67\\%$ of AUM in a given stock in their portfolios, modestly higher than the stock's weight $(0.43\\%)$ in the benchmark portfolio held by other institutions. Percentage incentives for large institutions, $0.67\\%$ direct and $0.33\\%$ flow, are about an order of magnitude weaker than for small institutions. In dollar terms, however, a $1\\%$ increase in firm value leads to an extra $\\$184,400$ of annual management fees for large institutions. The estimates suggest that large institutions should be willing to invest significant resources to improve the performance of firms they hold, consistent with recent evidence that large institutions take an active role in governance (Appel, Gormley, and Keim 2016; McCahery, Sautner, and Starks 2016).  \n\nThe final group, indexers, have the largest dollar holdings. All else equal, this provides stronger incentives to be active shareholders. But these institutions also have the lowest management fees and the most diversified portfolios, which push incentives in the opposite direction. The group's average stockholding is just $0.48\\%$ Oof the institution's porfolio, and total percentage incentives are just $0.56\\%$ $0.48\\%$ direct $+~0.08\\%$ flow). In dollar terms, indexers² total incentives equal $\\$114,000$ , only a small amount of which comes from flow incentives since their holdings closely mirror the aggregate holdings of other institutions. These dollar incentives sem modest given indexers’ size but, in absolute terms, still suggest that indexers should be willing to spend significant resources to improve firms in their portfolios.  \n\nOur estimates here provide an interesting perspective on the growing role of institutional investors and the rise of very large institutions. There seems to be a fairly common view that large institutions such as Blackrock and Vanguard have limited incentives to engage in corporate governance because of the scope of their holdings and limited ability to deviate from their benchmarks. The rise of low-cost index funds, in particular, suggests ‘corporate governance will take a backseat' (The Economist Intelligence Unit 2017) and is “bad for capitalism' because index funds cannot ésell their stocks if they dislike the actions of management? (The Economist 2017). However, our findings suggest that large institutions like Blackrock gain substantially when their holdings do well, by virtue of the additional management fees they stand to receive if AUM increases. Indeed, the largest institutional investors— because of their size—actually have stronger incentives than many activist investors, a group we explore in more detail below.?  \n\nAt the same time, the steady decline in management fees during the sample tends to reduce incentives, since it reduces the gains going to asset managers from any increase in firm value. For example, the dollar incentives for indexers in Fig. 2 would be much higher (\\$384,100 vs. \\$114,000) if their management fes were $0.50\\%$ rather than $0.15\\%$ from 2015-2017. Indeed, indexers have weaker incentives than other large institutions primarily because their fees are so much lower.  \n\nFigure 3 illustrates how average incentives change through time, value-weighting across institutions. Total percent incentives decline during the first 25 years of the sample, from roughly $5.0\\%$ to $2.5\\%$ ,buthave rebounded to just over $3\\%$ in the last 10 years. The decline and subsequent rebound mirror changes in institutions’ average portfolio weight (not shown), which drops from $2.5\\%$ in March 1980 to around $1.6\\%$ in recent years. At the same time, the average institution has become bigger over time, especially during the market boom in the 1990s. As a consequence, average dollar incentives increase dramatically from $\\$14,000$ in March 1980 to $\\$123,400$ in June 2000 (in 2017 dollars). Dollar incentives have not grown since that point, fluctuating with the level of the stock market and average AUM.  \n\n## 5.2 Activist investors  \n\nOur estimates imply that large institutions earn $\\$184,400$ in extra fees annually if a stockholding increases $1\\%$ in value. These incentives seem economically meaningful, but it might be useful to benchmark them against the incentives of “activists’ who file Schedule 13D, explicitly indicating an intention to influence the firm. In particular, Schedule 13D must be filed with the SEC when an investor, or coalition of investors, acquires more than a $5\\%$ stake in a firm unless the investor intends to remain passive (in which case Schedule 13G can often be filed). Activist investors choose to engage with firms, so their expected gains must be strong enough to compensate for engagement costs.  \n\nOur sample of 13D filings comes from Whale Wisdom, a data provider that collects and aggregates SEC filings. We merge WhaleWisdom's 13D data with our main sample in order to build a database of activist investments by institutional investors. To help ensure the integrity of the data, we require the institution to have a 13F filing in the same quarter as the 13D filing and to report holding at least $5\\%$ of shares outstanding at quarter end. We also restrict the sample to 13D holdings by institutions identified as investment advisors, hedge funds, or activist investors by WhaleWisdom (the full 13D dataset includes a small number of trusts, banks, foreign pension funds, and other investors). These filters produce a sample of 1,252 13D filings by 206 different institutional investors from 2015-2017.10  \n\nTable 4 shows incentives estimates for the sample of 13D holdings, i.e., we estimate how much an institution gains when a 13D holding increases $1\\%$ in value. An observation in the table corresponds to an institutionquarter-13D filing, with percentage and flow incentives determined by the investment's weight in the institution's broader portfolio. (The table summarizes the institution's overall stock portfolio, but non-13D investments are otherwise excluded from the analysis.)  \n\nWe report three sets of estimates for activists’ dollar incentives. The first two assume that institutions with 13D filings have the same management fees as the broader population of institutions (a $0.5\\%$ fee in the first approach or a size-matched percentage fee in the second approach). However, since many activists are private equity or hedge funds, we also report incentives assuming institutions earn a $1.3\\%$ management fee and $20\\%$ performance fee (close to average fees in recent years).f A complication here is that the performance fee is a one-time fee earned for good returns, while management fees are earned annually. To put the two on a comparable basis, we annualize the performance fee by dividing it by ten, i.e., we report the equivalent annual value if the performance fee is converted to a perpetuity at an interest rate of $10\\%$  \n\nThe average 13D holding in Table 4 is $\\$175$ million (Panel A) and represents $7.5\\%$ of an institution's portfolio on an equal-weighted basis and $13.4\\%$ of the portfolio on a value-weighted basis. These weights are much higher than for non-13D holdings and lead to incentives that are larger than the typical institutional holding. For example, if activist institutions earn the same management fees as the wider population of institutions (using our second, size-matched approach), the value-weighted average direct incentive is $\\$70,900$ and the average flow incentive is $\\$97,800$ , implying total dollar incentives of $\\$168,700$ for 13D holdings. The latter number grows to $\\$316,000$ if activist instead earn a $1.3\\%$ management fee, and annualized performance fees would add another $\\$204,300$ . These incentives compare with value-weighted average incentives of $\\$112,400$ for the full population of institutions and $\\$184,400$ for large non-index institutions (as reported earlier).  \n\nIt is also interesting to note that activist incentives are highly skewed and often quite modest. For example, from Panel A, $75\\%$ of 13D holdings are smaller than $\\$145$ million and have dollar incentives below $\\$45,000$ using our measure with a $1.3\\%$ management fe, performance-fee incentives below $\\$29,000$ , and total combined incentives below $\\$74,000$  \n\nThe picture that emerges from Table 4 is two-fold: First, the costs of much activism may be relatively small, since the costs should be bounded above by the potential gains that activists expect (as reflected in the incentive measures). Second, while activists overall have stronger incentives, larger institutions in our main sample often have incentives that are comparable to those of activist investors.  \n\n## 5.3Firm-level estimates  \n\nThe analysis above focuses on incentives at the institutional level. An alternative is to measure incentives at the firm level, averaging across a firm's shareholders. The underlying goal is to understand (i) whether institutional shareholders in a given firm have a strong incentive to engage with management and (i) for what types of firms are institutional incentives the strongest. To get at these issues, we average incentives either for all institutions holding a given firm (Table 5) or for just the firm's largest institutional shareholders (Table 6), weighting by the value of their holdings. Again, we focus initially on the most recent period, 2015-2017, but show results for the full sample later.  \n\nIn some ways, the message from Table 5 is similar to our conclusions from the institutional-level estimates: incentives often seem small but vary substantially across firms. For the equal-weighted average firm in Panel A, institutions own $58\\%$ of shares outstanding and invest, on average, $1.15\\%$ of AUM in the firm (conditional on holding the stock). Average percent incentives are relatively strong, $2.72\\%$ , but average dollar incentives are just $\\$12,000$ (based on our second, more conservative approach), reflecting the modest size of the typical  \n\ninstitutional holding.  \n\nIncentives are stronger for larger firms, as reflected in the value-weighted estimates in Panel B. Institutions own $72\\%$ of the value-weighted average firm and invest, on average, $1.63\\%$ of AUM in the firm. Average percent incentives equal $3.33\\%$ and, because the investments are larger in absolute terms, dollar incentives, \\$117,900, are about an order of magnitude greater than for the equal-weighted average firm. Incentives are more than $\\$162,100$ (per institution) for firms that make up $25\\%$ of total market cap and as high as $\\$533,800$ at the value-weighted 99th percentile. The results suggest that institutional investors in many firms would be willing to spend significant resources to improve the firm’s performance (assuming no externalities with other firms in their portfolios, an issue we consider shortly).  \n\nFlow incentives are, on average, a significant portion of total incentives in Table 5, but a key feature is that flow incentives can be negative if an institution invests only a small fraction of AUM in the firm (smaller than the portfolio weight held by other institutions). In those cases, flow incentives reduce the institution's incentive to engage with the firm and, in the extreme, can actually push total incentives negative, i.e., some institutional shareholders would benefit if the firm drops in value because their losses are smaller than the losses of competing institutions. In fact, for the value-weighted average firm, $22.1\\%$ of institutional shares are held by institutions with negative flow incentives and $5.6\\%$ of institutional shares are held by institutions with negative total incentives (not tabulated). Thus, a tiny fraction of a firm's shares are held by institutions with apparently perverse incentives.  \n\nIn Table 6, dollar incentives are roughly twice as strong for a firm's five biggest institutional shareholders (institutions with the largest stakes, not institutions with the largest AUM). The five biggest shareholders own roughly a quarter of total shares outstanding and gain an estimated $\\$231,100$ in annual management fees (per institution) if the value-weighted average firm increases $1\\%$ in value.  Average dollar incentives for these shareholders are greater than $\\$139,300$ for firms that make up more than half of total market cap (as indicated by the value-weighted median in Panel B of Table 6) and greater than $\\$306,900$ for firms that make up one quarter of total market cap (as indicated by the 75th percentile). Not surprisingly, shareholders with the largest stakes have the strongest incentives to engage with management and, presumably, are also the most likely to have an impact on corporate policies.  \n\nFigure 4 shows how institutional incentives vary with the size of the firm. We sort firms into value-weighted size quartiles (each group contains roughly $25\\%$ of total market value) and report value-weighted average incentives for all institutional shareholders of the firm (not just the biggest five). Group 1 has the smallest 3,823 firms with an average market cap of $\\$1.7$ billion, while group 4 has the largest 24 firms with an average market cap of $\\$237.8$ billion.  \n\nThe most striking result in the figure is that percentage incentives are only modestly lower for institutional shareholders of small stocks vs. large stocks. Put differently, the average institutional shareholder of a small firm invests nearly as much as a percent of AUM in the firm as the average institutional shareholder of a large firm, despite the fact that large firms are more than 100 times bigger. This reflects the fact that, conditional on holding a small stock, the average fractional ownership is greater ( $4.1\\%$ Vs. $2.1\\%$ ) and the fact that smaller institutions are more likely to hold smaller stocks. In dollar terms, however, institutional shareholders gain substantially more when large stocks do well. For quintile 4, average direct incentives equal $\\$123,700$ and average flow incentives equal $\\$74,000$ , implying that institutional shareholders in the largest firms earn an estimated $\\$247,700$ more in annual management fees (per institution) if the firm goes up $1\\%$ in value. (The cross-sectional patterns are similar but the magnitudes roughly double if we focus on the five largest shareholders of the firm.)  \n\n## 5.4  Discussion  \n\nOur results suggest that larger institutions often have meaningful incentives to be engaged shareholders. Of course, whether institutions act on these incentives depends on the costs of being engaged and the expected impact on a firm's value. Our comparison with activist investors in Section 5.2 provides indirect evidence that incentives can be strong enough to induce engagement, but a few studies provide direct evidence on the costs, impact, and frequency of different types of institutional engagement.  \n\nGantchev (2013) estimates the costs of activist campaigns using a structural model. Most activist campaigns are resolved through negotiations, but some include demands of board representation, proxy threats, and, in rare cases, proxy fights. The paper finds that campaigns ending in a proxy fight ( $7\\%$ of the sample) cost $\\$10.7$ million, while costs are $50\\%$ to $75\\%$ lower in less hostile cases. On the benefit side, the average returns to activism range from $2\\%$ to $8\\%$ and, on average, activists earn positive returns net of costs. (Similarly, Brav et al. 2008 report average announcement returns of $7-8\\%$ around 13D filings.)In comparison, our estimates imply that institutions gain roughly $\\$115,000$ in annual cash flow if firm value goes up $1\\%$ .or $\\$1.15$ million in present value if capitalized as a perpetuity at $10\\%$  \n\nAt the same time, most institutions do not engage in public activist campaigns (in our sample, only 206 institutions file Schedule 13D in the period 2015-2017).13 However, many institutions do choose less confrontational forms of engagement. McCahery, Sautner, and Starks (2016) survey 143 large institutions and find that $63\\%$ of respondents conduct private discussions with management in response to concerns about corporate governance and disagreements about a firm's strategy. Surveys by Institutional Shareholder Services (2014) and Ernst and Young (2016) report similar results and find that such engagement has been increasing in recent years.  \n\nThe impact of behind-the-scenes engagement is difficult to quantify. The skeptical view is that most institutions lack the expertise to identify value-enhancing changes to a firm's strategy or the power to pressure managers because, unlike activists, they refrain from public confrontation. This view is consistent with mixed evidence that institutional engagement has a significant impact on firm value (Wahal 1996; Strickland, Wiles, and Zenner 1996; Carleton, Nelson, and Weisbach 1998; Del Guercio and Hawkins 1998). On the other hand, Carleton, Nelson, and Weisbach show that, of 43 firms targeted for governance changes by TIAA-CREF from 1992-1996, all but one reached an agreement with TIAA-CREF, typically through private negotiations without a shareholder vote (see also Pozen 1994; Nesbitt 1994; Wahal, 1996; Gillan and Starks 2000). In addition,  \n\nBushee (1998), Hartzell and Starks (2003), Aghion, Van Reenen, and Zingales (2013), Fich, Harford, and Tran (2015) and others provide evidence that institutional owners affect a variety of corporate decisions. Firms may pay attention to the views of their largest shareholders because they have considerable voting power, the ability to sway others, or simply because the CEO and board want to maintain a good relationship with the firm's shareholders. These institutions seem to have both the incentive and ability to engage with firms, even if they are not ‘activist' investors.  \n\n# 6 Rival incentives  \n\nThe estimates above focus on how much an institution gains if an individual firm in its portfolio does well. In practice, institutions often invest in several firms in the same industry, and decisions made by one firm can affect other firms owned by the institution. Casual observation suggests this phenomenon has become more widespread in recent years and has led to growing concerns about the possible effects on competition. In this section, we explore the prevalence of common ownership, measure its impact on institutions′ incentives, and study how these incentives vary across firms and industries.  \n\nOur approach here is a simple extension of the analysis above. For each firm, we estimate how much the firm's institutional shareholders gain or lose when other firms in the industry (\\*rivals') increase in value, by virtue of the institutions’ holdings of those firms. Specifically, ‘rival incentives’ for a given institutional shareholder of firm $i$ are measured as:  \n\nwhere $p$ is the institution's percentage management fee, $j$ indexes other firms in the same industry as $\\mathrm{firm}i,{\\boldsymbol{w}}_{j}$ and $\\nu_{j}$ are weights in the institution's portfolio and benchmark portfolio, respectively, and $\\beta$ is the estimated flow-to-performance sensitivity for institutions. (Eqs. 8 and 9 give the dollar change in management fees from a $100\\%$ increase in rivals′ value; as before, we divide by $p^{*}A U M$ to express incentives on a percentage basis or divide by 100 to get the gain or loss from a $1\\%$ increase in value.) The estimates provide a simple measure of an institution's incentives to consider the impact on a firm's competitors when voting on shareholder  \n\nproposals, engaging with management, etc.14  \n\nA distinguishing feature of our framework is that rival incentives depend not just on an institution's holdings in the industry (direct incentives), but also on the holdings of other institutions through the impact on relative performance and subsequent flows. Even if an institution invests in rival firms, it might not have strong— or, indeed, even positive—rival incentives if other institutions invest more heavily in those firms. In other words, rival incentives depend on whether an institution under- or overweights rivals compared with other institutions, an effect that has not been considered by the prior literature.  \n\nPart of our goal here is to inform the debate on how common ownership might affect competition among firms. An important consideration is that common ownership and any impact on competition are likely to depend on the size of the industry. For example, an institution might be more likely to invest in several firms in an industry of 200 firms than an industry of 10 firms, and the impact of any cross-holdings in the two industries could be quite different. To address this issue, we report results separately for more- and lessconcentrated industries, sorting either by the number of competitors or the fraction of sales coming from the four largest firms (the four-firm concentration ratio).  \n\n## 6.1  Estimates of rival incentives  \n\nTable 7 reports estimates of rival incentives and, for comparison, the ^own-firm’ measure of incentives from Table 5 (i.e., incentives for firm $i$ itself). We estimate incentives for all institutions holding a given firm, take the holding-weighted average across shareholders, and report the value-weighted cross-sectional distribution of the firm-level estimates. Own-firm incentives represent the gain to a firm's institutional shareholders if that firm goes up in value, while rival incentives represent the gain to the same institutions if other firms in the industry go up in value. We focus on firm-level estimates here in order to study how much rival incentives might impact the engagement choices of a given firm's shareholders. For brevity, we report dollar incentives using only our second approach for estimating management fees, which allows percentage fees to vary with an institution's size and investment approach.  \n\nPanel A focuses on firms in the most-concentrated industries, defined here as 3-digit SIC codes with 2-6 firms (we consider alternative definitions later).1 In these industries, an average institutional shareholder in a given firm invests $1.46\\%$ of AUM in that firm but a smaller amount, $0.29\\%$ , in total in all of the firm's rivals. The first number represents a large overweight relative to other institutions’ investment in the firm $(0.26\\%)$ , while the second number is slightly higher than the benchmark weight $(0.18\\%)$ .16 Thus, an institution that invests in one firm in the most-concentrated industries sometimes invests in the firms’ rivals, but the size of the investment is relatively modest. As a consequence, rival incentives are, on average, much smaller than ownfirm incentives in these industries, $0.43\\%$ in percentage terms and \\$31,400 in dollar terms, compared with own-firm incentives of $3.13\\%$ and $\\$78,100$ , respectively.  \n\nA key result in Panel A is that, if an institution invests in one firm in the most-concentrated industries, it often underweights rivals (even though the average overweight is slightly positive). In particular, the row labeled 'negative flow incentives′ shows that $65.3\\%$ of institution-held shares are held by institutions that underweight rival firms. These institutions may invest some in a firm's competitors, producing positive direct incentives, but an increase in rivals′ value reduces the institutions’ performance relative to other institutions and predicts lower subsequent flow. Remarkably, $46.2\\%$ of institution-held shares for the average firm in Panel A are held by institutions for which the negative flow effect is bigger than the positive direct effect, i.e., the institutions gain when the firm's rivals do poorly. These institutions provide a potentially powerful counterweight to other shareholders that might favor policies that benefit rivals.  \n\nCommon ownership is, of course, more pervasive in industries with more firms, where the scope for crossownership is greater. In industries with 7-18 firms (Panel B), the average institutional shareholder in a firm invests $1.31\\%$ of AUM in that firm and $0.76\\%$ of AUM in all other firms in the industry. The first number is much higher than the firm's weight in the benchmark portfolio $(0.21\\%)$ , while the second number is marginally higher than the benchmark weight $(0.51\\%)$ . The majority $(56.2\\%)$ of institutional shares are held by institutions that underweight rivals.  \n\nIn industries with more than 18 firms (Panel C), the total value of rivals is larger and common ownership is greater. Conditional on investing in one firm in those industries, the average institution invests an additional $4.70\\%$ of AUM in other firms in the industry. This weight is higher than the firms′ weight of $3.88\\%$ in the benchmark portfolio held by other institutions, and roughly half of institutional shares in a given firm are held by institutions that underweight rivals.  \n\n## 6.2 Discussion  \n\nAt one level, the interpretation of Table 7 is simple: common ownership of firms in the same industry is indeed common, especially in industries with many firms. A decision by one firm in an institution's portfolio, if it has broader industry effects, will often impact multiple firms held by the institution. Thus, at the most basic level, an institutional shareholder often has at least some incentive to consider the fortunes of rival firms when voting on shareholder proposes or engaging with management.  \n\nThe magnitudes are perhaps more important to consider. One interpretation, as discussed earlier, is that dollar incentives equal the maximum annualized amount an institution would be willing to spend to bring about a One-time $1\\%$ increase in value. This number is relatively modest for rival firms in the most-concentrated industries: the average institution would be willing to spend $\\$31,400$ annually in exchange for a $1\\%$ increase in the total value of all rival firms, equivalent to just \\$8,100 per rival (compared with own-firm incentives of \\$78,100; the per-rival numbers are not tabulated). Rival incentives are larger for industries with many firms, sincea $1\\%$ increase in the value of a big portfolio represents a bigger dollar increase, but remain small on a per-rival basis: rival incentives are \\$446,900 in the least-concentrated industries in Panel C, equivalent to just \\$3,700 per rival. Across all industries, the incentives per rival firm are relatively modest, with a value of just \\$35,500 even at the 99th percentile of the distribution. The per-rival numbers imply that the average institutional shareholder of one firm gains much more if that firm goes up $1\\%$ in value (\\$118,400 on average across all firms) than if another firm in the industry goes up $1\\%$ $\\$4,600$ on average).  \n\nTo put the numbers in perspective, suppose regulators are worried that institutional investors have an incentive to promote collusion among firms, given their ownership of multiple firms in the industry. If collusion would increase the value of all firms in the industry by $1\\%$ , an average institutional shareholder would gain \\$4,600 per rival from such a policy (in addition to the own-firm effect). Thus, the typical institution would only find it optimal to promote collusion if the engagement and coordination costs—-not to mention the legal risks—-per firm are quite small. To be clear, we are focusing here on the incremental incentive effects of common ownership; the shareholders of any firm, even in the absence of common ownership, would have an incentive to collude with competitors.  \n\nAs a second example of anticompetitive incentives, consider a policy that increases the value of a firm at the expense of other firms in the industry, dollar-for-dollar. If the costs are distributed across rivals in proportion to their market caps, a $1\\%$ gain for one firm implies a $0.77\\%$ loss for the average rival firm in the same SIC code.17 Based on our estimates in Table 7, a $1\\%$ increase in firm value leads to an $\\$118,400$ increase in annual cash flow for the average institutional shareholder of the firm (own-firm effect), offset by a $\\$51,400$ decrease in annual cash flow caused by the institution's losses from the drop in value of rival firms. The latter number varies from $\\$32,300$ in the most-concentrated SIC codes to \\$61,300 in the least-concentrated SIC codes. Institutions′ cross-holdings in the industry tend to reduce by roughly $40\\%$ the average institution's incentive to support a policy that helps the firm at the expense of industry rivals.  \n\n## 6.3Extensions  \n\nTable 8 repeats the analysis using two alternative definitions of industry concentration, the first based on fourfirm concentration ratios and the second based on Hoberg and Phillips’ (HP 2010, 2016) industries. For the latter, we use HP's recommended TNIC- $.3^{\\circ}$ dataset that identifies a firm's closest competitors from product descriptions in 10-K filings (the ‘coarseness’ is designed to be similar to 3-digit SIC codes). An important feature is that the TNIC-3 datasets is not transitive, i.e., firm A may compete with firms B and C even though B and C do not compete with each other. Thus, the TNIC-3 data does not identify distinct industries, per se, but instead gives us a measure of how many competitors a firm has. We sort firms into three groups based on this count (1-5 competitors vs. 6-17 competitors vs. 18 or more competitors), mirroring the sort using SIC codes in Table 7. (The sample drops to 3,407 firms in Panel B because the HP dataset does not have competitors for all firms.)  \n\nThe results in Table 8 are similar to those in Table 7 (for brevity, Table 8 reports only the value-weighted mean of the firm-level estimates). In industries with the highest four-firm concentration ratios in Panel A, an institutional shareholder in a given firms invests, on average, $1.50\\%$ in that firm and $0.64\\%$ in all of the firms' rivals, leading to own-firm incentives that are about twice as large as rival incentives (\\$105,300 vs. $\\$59,300$ In Panel B, an institutional shareholder in a firm with few competitors invests, on average, $1.25\\%$ of AUM in that firm and $0.27\\%$ in all of its competitors, implying own-firm incentives that are about three times stronger than rival incentives (\\$78,900 vs. $\\$27,500$ ). Again, institutional shareholders invest more in competitors when the number of competitors is larger, increasing to $1.11\\%$ of AUM when there are 6-17 competitors (compared with an own-firm investment of $1.77\\%$ ) and $5.01\\%$ of AUM when there are 18 or more competitors (compared with an own-firm investment of $1.58\\%$  \n\nTable 9 replicates the analysis using just a firm's five largest institutional shareholders (i.e., those with the largest stakes). The results are similar to those in Tables 7 and 8 except that dollar incentives here are about twice as big. The largest institutional shareholders of one firm tend to invest in rival firms with about the same propensity as other institutions, with an average portfolio weight somewhat higher than the benchmark weight. At the same time, more than half of large shareholders in the most-concentrated industries underweight rivals, implying that a substantial fraction of a firm's largest shareholders have negative rival flow incentives and about one-quarter have negative total rival incentives. Those institutions have a particularly strong incentive to promote policies that benefit the firm at the expense of industry rivals, again providing a potentially important counterweight to institutions with greater common ownership in the industry.  \n\nTable 10 considers an alternative way to identify large shareholdings, in this case focusing on each institution's largest holding within an industry (3-digit SIC code). The idea is that an institution's largest holding in the industry might be regarded as its ‘main’ holding and command a disproportionate share of the institution's attention. We estimate incentives for this set of holdings and report the distribution of institution-level estimates. Own-firm incentives for these holdings are much larger than rival incentives. For example, in the most-concentrated industries, an institution invests $0.98\\%$ of its portfolio in its largest holding in the industry but just $0.14\\%$ in all of the firm's rivals, leading to own-firm incentives that are many times larger than rival incentives, $2.00\\%$ Vs. $0.14\\%$ in percentage terms and $\\$80,600$ Vs. $\\$123,400$ in dollar terms. At the same time, rival incentives reach as high as $\\$116,300$ at the 99th percentile.18  \n\nTable 11 looks at the link between rival incentives and indexing. Many of the recent concerns about common ownership focus on large indexers like Blackrock and Vanguard that often invest in multiple firms in the same industry. It seems interesting, then, to compare rival incentives for the large indexers in our data (Schwab, Dimensional, State Street, Blackrock, and Vanguard) with rival incentives of other institutions. For brevity, Table 11 focuses on the most-concentrated industries, where concerns about the impact of common ownership are likely to be greatest.  \n\nIndexers have stronger dollar incentives than the average non-indexer. As observed earlier, indexers hold very diversified portfolios, with portfolio weights that are similar to the benchmark portfolio held in aggregate by other institutions.19 For example, in Panel A, the average index shareholder in a given firm (in the most concentrated industries) invests $0.33\\%$ of AUM in that firm and only slightly less, $0.20\\%$ , in the firms’ rivals, closely matching the benchmark weights ( $0.27\\%$ and $0.19\\%$ , respectively). Indexers own-firm incentives are about twice as large as their rival incentives in both percentage ( $0.42\\%$ Vs. $0.22\\%$ ) and dollar (\\$80,400 vs. $\\$45,300$ terms. In comparison, non-index institutions invest $2.35\\%$ of AUM in a given stock-holding and $0.31\\%$ of AUM in the firm's rivals. Non-indexers tend to be smaller but earn higher management fees, and the net effect is that their own-firm dollar incentives are similar to indexers’ (\\$78,900 vs. $\\$80,400$ ）while their rival-firm incentives are weaker (\\$26,600 vs. \\$45,300). Thus, common ownership is relatively more important for large indexers than for other institutions.  \n\nThe conclusions are similar from the other panels in Table 11, which identify highly-concentrated industries using four-firm concentration ratios (Panel B) and number of Hoberg-Phillips competitors (Panel C). The main difference is that, in Panel B, indexers? rival incentives are slightly higher than their own-firm incentives. Conditional on investing in one firm in a high-concentration-ratio industry ( $0.45\\%$ of AUM), indexers invest an additional $0.55\\%$ of AUM in the firm's rivals. Both percentages are similar to the weights in the benchmark portfolio, but the results show that index shareholders in one firm often have significant exposure to other firms in the same industry. In dollar terms, an index shareholder gains, on average, $\\$113,400$ in annual management fees when the firm goes up $1\\%$ in value and $\\$119,000$ in fees when all other firms in the industry go up $1\\%$ in value. The latter number equals $\\$10,600$ per rival. This suggests that, while indexers gain from an overall increase in industry value, they would only find it optimal to promote collusion if the engagement, coordination, and legal costs per firm are relatively small.  \n\nFor additional perspective, consider again a policy that increases the value of one firm at the expense of industry rivals, dollar-for-dollar, with the drop in rivals? values distributed in proportion to their market caps. In Panel A, the \\$80,400 gain in management fees for the average indexer (own-firm effect) would be offset by a $\\$58,600$ loss in management fees from the drop in rivals’ values; for non-indexers, the own-firm gain of $\\$78,900$ would be offset by a $\\$23,400$ loss from the drop in rivals’ values. In Panel B, the own-firm gain of \\$113,900 for indexers would be offset by a $\\$92,600$ loss from the drop in rivals’ values, while the own-firm gain of \\$106,600 for non-indexers would be offset by a loss of $\\$26,800$ . Like other institutions, the indexers benefit from policies that increase the value of a firm at the expense of rivals, but their greater ownership of multiple firms in an industry means their net gains are much smaller.  \n\nFigure 5 explores how incentives have changed since 1980. For the most-concentrated industries (SIC codes), rival incentives are always much lower than own-firm incentives. Rival incentives in Panel A fluctuate around $0.4\\%$ throughout the sample, compared to roughly $3.0\\%$ for own-firm incentives. In less-concentrated industries (Panel B), rival incentives trend up through time and have been consistently higher than own-firm incentives for the last 20 years (these are total incentives if all rival firms go up in value; the numbers are much smaller on a per-firm basis). Rival incentives increase from about $4\\%$ in the 1980s to $5-6\\%$ in recent years, with an additional and fairly significant rise to nearly $7\\%$ at the very end of the sample, while own-firm incentives drop from about $4-5\\%$ in the 1980s to $3-4\\%$ in recent years. Notwithstanding the modest trends, the graphs do not suggest a dramatic change in the importance of common ownership and rival incentives through time (except, perhaps, for the rise in less-concentrated industries in 2017).  \n\nFigure 6 provides an alternative perspective on trends in common ownership, focusing on the fraction of institution-held shares for which the shareholder has negative rival incentives, i.e., the institution gains if rival firms drop in value. The solid line in each panel shows that most institutional shareholders underweight other firms in the industry, but the fraction has steadily declined through time, from $80\\%$ to $60\\%$ for moreconcentrated industries and from $55\\%$ to $50\\%$ for less-concentrated industries. The dashed line shows that, even taking into account the positive direct incentives when an institution invests in rivals, total incentives are often negative as well, especially in the more-concentrated industries. The fraction of institutional shares held by institution with negative total rival incentives drops from roughly $75\\%$ to $45\\%$ for more-concentrated industries and from $30\\%$ to $15\\%$ for less-concentrated industries. These trends provide more evidence that a rise in common ownership has changed the incentives of institutional investors.  \n\n# 7 Conclusions  \n\nThe growth of institutional investors raises fundamental questions about their role in corporate governance. Our paper studies the financial incentives that institutions have to be active shareholders: How much does an institution gain from taking an action—-monitoring the firm, engaging with management, voting on shareholder proposals—that affects firm value?  We measure incentives as the increase in an institution's annual management fee caused by a $1\\%$ increase in the value of a portfolio firm, considering both the direct impact of an increase in AUM and the indirect effect via relative performance and subsequent fund inflows.  \n\nOur estimates suggests that institutions′ incentives are frequently modest but can be strong, especially for larger firms and larger institutions. The typical institution holds a fairly concentrated portfolio, with a portfolio weight of $1.56\\%$ invested in an average (value-weighted) holding in 2017, far higher than the firm's weight in the aggregate portfolio held by other institutions. As a result, institutions gain an extra $\\$123,000$ in annual management fees, on average, if a holding goes up $1\\%$ in value (taking into account both direct and flow incentives, and allowing management fees to vary with an institution's size). Our estimate varies from \\$31,300 for small institutions, to $\\$133,000$ for large institutions with sizable index funds, and to $\\$219,500$ for other large institutions. These numbers can be interpreted as the maximum annualized amount an institution would be willing to spend to bring about a one-time, $1\\%$ increase in firm value, suggesting that large institutions have meaningful incentives to be engaged shareholders. (To be sure, incentives are much smaller for many holdings.) Indeed, the incentives of largest institutions, by virtue of their size, are comparable to the incentives of many activist investors.  \n\nWe also study an institution's incentives to consider how firm policies affect other firms in the industry. As prior studies point out, such incentives arise because institutions often invest in multiple firms in an industry. We find that rival incentives can be significant, especially for large indexing institutions, but are generally weak in the most-concentrated industries (in which concerns about strategic interactions might be larger). We also find that, for a significant fraction of institutional shareholders in a given firm, rival incentives are actually negative because the institution underweights rival firms relative to competing institutions, implying that an increase in the value of a rival hurts the institution's relative performance and, hence, subsequent flows. This flow effect has a potential to counteract the incentives of other shareholders that gain when other firms in the industry do well.  \n\nOur approach complements the recent literature on institutional ownership by offering a direct estimate of institutions’ financial incentives to be engaged. The approach can be extended in several ways. First, while our analysis focuses on the potential gains from being active, the costs of engagement remain relatively poorly understood. Second, more research is needed to understand how institutions can affect managerial decisions, and in general, whether institutional engagement is successful and has a significant impact on value. Finally, institutions may be engaged shareholders for non-financial reasons, such as for legal, social, or political reasons, and the relative importance of these motives is not well understood.  \n\n8 References   \nAggarwal, Reena, Isil Erel, Miguel Ferreira and Pedro Matos, 2011.

WRDS documents serious problems with the data starting in 2013Q2 and provides a supplemental dataset for June 2013-December 2017 based on institutions’ original 13F filings on EDGAR. This Appendix summarizes how we clean the dataset and merge it with Thomson Reuters.  \n\nTo start, we identify and fix a variety of errors in the raw 13F filings, including (i) errors in CUSIP numbers; (i) transposed ‘share’ and ‘value’ columns; (i) inconsistent reporting of Berkshire Hathaway shares (presumably due to the unusually high price of BRK.A shares, some institutions multiply their shares held by 100 and, implicitly, divide the share price by 100); (iv) inconsistent treatment of stock splits that occur between the reporting and filing dates; and (v) inconsistent labeling of whether an amended filing ^adds new holdings′ or ‘is a restatement.? We identified errors by comparing the reported value of holdings in the 13F file to the value calculated using CRSP stock prices or looking for anomalous changes in holdings or portfolio value from one quarter to the next.2o  \n\nInstitutions in the WRDS 13F database are then linked to institutions on Thomson Reuters by name and, where possible, comparing AUM and number of holdings as secondary checks. (Much of the matching was done by hand, given the variety of abbreviations and naming conventions used by Thomson Reuters.) In many cases where an initial match was not found, we traced the issue (via EDGAR or an internet search) to name changes in 13F filings not reflected in the Thomson Reuters database. In a relatively small number of cases, Thomson Reuters appears to aggregate or disaggregate 13F filings, i.e., some institutions on Thomson Reuters file under multiple CIKs (which Thomson Reuters combines) and some institutions have holdings reported by another institution (which Thomson Reuters reports separately). In the end, we are able to link the vast majority of institutions in the two databases.  \n\nIt might be useful to note that the accuracy of the link has a very limited effect on our tests. Combining the datasets simply allows us create a consistent time series of holdings for a given institution, before and after 2013Q2 (using Thomson Reuters data before and WRDS 13F data after). However, we only use the time series for a given institution when we estimate flow-to-performance sensitivities; our main results otherwise require only the cross section of holdings at a given point in time.  \n\nMore generally, the results in the paper are not sensitive to whether we (i) ignore errors in the WRDS 13F data (other than doing basic consistency checks, such as ensuring that shares held is less than shares outstanding); (i) use Thomson Reuters? updated data that at least partially fixes the problems identified by WRDS; or (i) use a linking table provided by WRDS rather than our own links (the WRDS linking table was used in previous drafts of the paper, with similar results).  \n\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics, 1980-2017   \nThis table reports descriptive statistics for our sample of institutions and firms (cross-sectional average, median, standard deviation, and 1st, 25th, 75th, and 99th percentiles) from 1980-2017. Panels A and B report statistics by institution for assets under management (in 2017 dollars) and number of firms held (in these panels, N is the number of institutions in the sample). Panels C and D report statistics by firm for the number of institutional shareholders and fraction of shares owned by institutions (in these panels, N is the number of firms). Institutional ownership comes from Thomson Reuters and WRDS, while price and shares outstanding come from CRSP. Institutional ownership is aggregated to the firm level using   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"8\"></td></tr><tr><td>Period</td><td>Avg</td><td>Med</td><td>Std</td><td>p1</td><td>p25</td><td>p75</td><td>p99</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Panel A: Assets under management (S millions), by institution</td></tr><tr><td>1980-1984</td><td>2,395</td><td>855</td><td>3,947</td><td>35</td><td>401</td><td>2,444 18,504</td><td>540</td></tr><tr><td>1985-1989</td><td>2,907</td><td>831</td><td>6,201</td><td>20</td><td>354</td><td>2,568 30,966</td><td>785</td></tr><tr><td>1990-1994</td><td>3,225</td><td>671</td><td>8,912</td><td>16</td><td>272</td><td>2,274 39,172</td><td>1,006</td></tr><tr><td>1995-1999</td><td>5,743</td><td>689</td><td>23,911</td><td>27</td><td>284 2,484</td><td>95,765</td><td>1,342</td></tr><tr><td>2000-2004</td><td>5,948</td><td>491</td><td>31,184</td><td>18</td><td>201</td><td>1,874 110,373</td><td>1,815</td></tr><tr><td>2005-2009</td><td>5,113</td><td>380</td><td>31,614</td><td>10</td><td>149</td><td>1,496 83,621</td><td>2,468</td></tr><tr><td>2010-2014</td><td>4,745</td><td>325</td><td>35,165</td><td>5</td><td>128</td><td>1,344 71,078</td><td>2,945</td></tr><tr><td>2015-2017</td><td>5,292</td><td>302</td><td>47,913</td><td>4</td><td>113</td><td>1,159 75,986</td><td>3,648</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\"></td></tr><tr><td>PanelB:Numberoffirmsheld,byinstitution 1980-1984</td><td></td><td></td><td>193 13</td><td>76</td><td>233</td><td>920</td><td>540</td></tr><tr><td>1985-1989</td><td>192 225</td><td>128 125</td><td>328</td><td>10</td><td>66</td><td>256 1,584</td><td>785</td></tr><tr><td>1990-1994</td><td>242</td><td>114</td><td>403</td><td>11</td><td>64</td><td>253 1,933</td><td>1,006</td></tr><tr><td>1995-1999</td><td>269</td><td>112</td><td>488</td><td>9</td><td>62</td><td>244 2,476</td><td>1,342</td></tr><tr><td>2000-2004</td><td>260</td><td>96</td><td>509</td><td>7</td><td>53</td><td>208 2,884</td><td>1,815</td></tr><tr><td>2005-2009</td><td>228</td><td>81</td><td>470</td><td>6</td><td>40</td><td>183 2,716</td><td>2,468</td></tr><tr><td>2010-2014</td><td>212</td><td>76</td><td>425</td><td>5</td><td>35</td><td>176 2,522</td><td>2,945</td></tr><tr><td>2015-2017</td><td>212</td><td>76</td><td>429</td><td>5</td><td>32 175</td><td>2,576</td><td>3,648</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\"></td></tr><tr><td>Panel C:Numberofinstitutional shareholders,byfirm 1980-1984</td><td>19</td><td>3</td><td>43</td><td>0</td><td>0 14</td><td>232</td><td>5,259</td></tr><tr><td>1985-1989</td><td>28</td><td>8</td><td>59 0</td><td>2</td><td>25</td><td>319</td><td>6,226</td></tr><tr><td>1990-1994</td><td>39</td><td>13</td><td>73</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>37 388</td><td>6,281</td></tr><tr><td>1995-1999</td><td>48</td><td>17</td><td>88</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>52 455</td><td>7,504</td></tr><tr><td>2000-2004</td><td>81</td><td>37</td><td>126</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>100 661</td><td>5,933</td></tr><tr><td>2005-2009</td><td>113</td><td>66</td><td>155</td><td>1</td><td>20</td><td>140 811</td><td>4,956</td></tr><tr><td>2010-2014</td><td>148</td><td>89</td><td>200</td><td>1</td><td>30</td><td>175 1,038</td><td>4,225</td></tr><tr><td>2015-2017</td><td>186</td><td>110</td><td>253</td><td>4</td><td>40</td><td>215 1,384</td><td>4,175</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Panel D: Institutional ownership (fraction of shares), by firm</td></tr><tr><td>1980-1984</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.19</td><td>0.59</td><td>5,259</td></tr><tr><td>1985-1989</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.19</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.29</td><td>0.70</td><td>6,226</td></tr><tr><td>1990-1994</td><td>0.23</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.38</td><td>0.79</td><td>6,281</td></tr><tr><td>1995-1999</td><td>0.28</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.47</td><td>0.89</td><td>7,504</td></tr><tr><td>2000-2004</td><td>0.36</td><td>0.31</td><td>0.29</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.60</td><td>0.97</td><td>5,933</td></tr><tr><td>2005-2009</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.51</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.21</td><td>0.79</td><td>1.00</td><td>4,956</td></tr><tr><td>2010-2014</td><td>0.54</td><td>0.59</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.24</td><td>0.84</td><td>1.00</td><td>4,225</td></tr><tr><td>2015-2017</td><td>0.58</td><td>0.65</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.87</td><td>1.00</td><td>4,175</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table estimates the flow-to-performance sensitivity for institutional investors based on average slopes from crosssectional regressions of net inflow on lagged benchmark-adjusted returns (intercepts are not reported). In Panel A, net inflow in quarters $^{\\mathrm{t+1}}$ ， $_{\\mathrm{t}+2}$ $^{\\mathrm{t}+12}$ is regressed on benchmark-adjusted returns in quarter t (separate regressions for each horizon). In Panel B, net inflow is regressed on 12 lags of benchmark-adjusted returns (combined regression; the slope on lag $\\mathrm{k\\Omega}$ is reported under horizon $\\mathbf{\\tilde{\\gamma}_{t+k}},$ ). Net inflow is the growth rate of assets under management minus the institution's quarterly return.

In both developed and emerging economies, we find better legal rights and their enforcement significantly affect the likelihood of VC success. As well, better developed stock markets have a positive influence on VC performance, which highlights the importance of capital markets for development of VC industry. Strikingly, we find that cultural distance between the countries of the portfolio company and its lead VC investor is positively related to VC success. Further analyses reveal that cultural differences create incentives for better ex-ante screening and due diligence, so transactions involving high cultural disparity materialize only when they have substantial economic potential. Finally, consistent with the “home bias” literature, the presence of local VC investors positively influences VC success and mitigates foreign VC firms? \"liability of foreignness\"” arising from institutional and cultural differences, but only in developed economies. Local VC participation does not affect performance in emerging economies, which highlights the lack of expertise/experience of local investors in those countries. Our conclusions follow from the analyses of VC investments in more than 9,0o0 companies across 32 countries that include both developed and emerging economies.  \n\n## Introduction  \n\nIn recent years, global venture capital (VC) investing has increased manifold in terms of capital involved, number of deals, and geographical diversity. Initially largely confined to North America and a few Western European countries, VC investing is now a phenomenon throughout the world. Global non-U.S. VC investing reached nearly $\\$25$ billion in 2007 (Source: SDC Platinum Venture Economics) and many U.S. based VC firms actively invest abroad. Most research to date has analyzed VC investments in North America, which primarily include funding of U.S. based companies. In this study we analyze the determinants of VC success in global investing, focusing especially on country-specific institutional and cultural factors.  \n\nSuccessful global investing can have several benefits for VC firms in terms of improved access to deal flow, increased diversification, and potentially higher growth. However, the observed success of VC investments varies substantially across countries, which suggests there are important country-specific factors that facilitate successful VC exits.  \n\nFor instance, several accounts by academics and practitioners highlight the importance of legal and institutional framework, culture, and local partners in international investment decisions. While several studies (for example, La Porta, Lopez de Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny, 1997, 1998) emphasize the positive effect of the legal environment on financial decision making and valuations, some recent works (Allen et al., 2005, 2007) suggest that at least in some emerging markets, business can prosper within an underdeveloped legal system. This highlights the possibility that legal rights and protection that are considered important in well-developed economies may not have similar significance in all countries. In a similar vein, while a welldeveloped stock market in the U.S. is often regarded as an important catalyst for the development of VC industry (Black and Gilson, 1998), it remains an empirical question whether stock market development matters for VC success.? The analysis of global VC investments allows us to formally determine the impact of two very important dimensions of a country's institutional framework-law and capital markets-on VC success.  \n\nWhile international investing has advantages, it can also increase risk manifold when VC firms invest in foreign countries. Investments in small private companies with intangible assets and unproven technologies are undoubtedly risky propositions, and even more so in less developed and emerging economies. Furthermore, the unfamiliar environment and lack of awareness of local cultural and social practices, amplify the already substantial agency problems VCs face due to large information asymmetries with insider managers and entrepreneurs. On one hand, cultural differences can seriously impede VC success. Yet, on the other, we observe several transactions that involve investor and investee firms from different countries (Bottazzi, Da Rin, and Hellmann, 2008b). How then do cultural differences affect VC performance? And, in view of cultural and institutional differences, how important is the role of local partners? Have local non U.S. VC firms been effective in contributing to portfolio company success given the acute information asymmetry between company insiders and non-local investors? A positive effect would indicate that local partners can serve to alleviate agency problems and align interests of insiders and outside investors, thereby boosting investment performance.  \n\nThus our key objective in analyzing VC investments in an international context is to ascertain the impact of legal rights and protection, stock market development, cultural differences, and local investor participation on VC success. While prior work examines the effects of institutional and cultural differences on VC investment decisions, their impact on VC success has not been analyzed. Second, by focusing on an international setting, we are able to discern the value added by local VC investors and their contribution to VC success. In so doing, we not only add to the large body of work on “liability of foreignness\", but also contribute to the literature on “home bias\". To facilitate our analysis of VC success, we assemble the largest-todate dataset comprising VC financing of more than 9,000 companies across 32 countries that include both developed and emerging economies.  \n\nOur results indicate both institutional and cultural factors are important in determining VC success internationally. First, we construct country-specific legal indices that capture shareholder rights, enforcement rights, rule of law, corruption, and accounting disclosure standards, and relate them to the likelihood of VC success.? In line with the evidence in La Porta et al. (2007, 2008), our results suggest that law matters for success of private investments as well. In particular, better country-specific legal rights and protections positively influence VC success, and do so in both developed and emerging economies.  \n\nSecond, we find that a well developed, IPO-conducive stock market, is an important catalyst in VC success in both developed and emerging economies. This is consistent with Black and Gilson's (1998) conjecture on the significance of a better developed stock market for sustenance and growth of VC industry. Well functioning capital markets are not only beneficial for conducting IPOs, but they also provide much needed stock currency for potential bidders engaging in acquisitions. It is well known that successful VC exits largely involve initial public offerings (IPOs) and acquisitions of privately held VC-backed companies.  \n\nHowever, globally, we observe that the proportion of successful VC exits through IPOs or acquisitions is substantially lower than that observed in the U.s. This suggests that better developed stock markets (as in U.S.) encourage VC investing, as higher average returns, particularly from IPOs, provide VCs additional incentives to invest in and provide their expertise and skills to their portfolio companies (see also footnote 2). Furthermore, founder entrepreneurs may also have a higher likelihood of retaining control over their companies if IPOs were to occur more frequently, which in turn provide the entrepreneurs additional incentives to work harder for their companies’ success (Black and Gilson, 1998).  \n\nThird, we explore the significance of culture on VC success. Although intuitively appealing, the role played by culture in economic outcomes is a relatively new area of research (Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales, 2006). Cultural differences between their countries are likely to influence transactions between VC investors and portfolio companies. Furthermore, these differences can affect the level of trust, nature of financial contracting, and portfolio company performance. Anecdotal evidence suggests that both VCs and entrepreneurs emphasize the importance of good working relationships, in an atmosphere of trust, for a better chance of success. Unfamiliarity with the local business practices and/or lack of trust, driven in part by cultural differences, may adversely impact these relations and hence impede VC success.  \n\nSome recent studies that relate cultural differences and economic decision making include Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2007, 2008) who examine the role of trust in investment decisions. In the VC context, Bottazzi, Da Rin, and Hellmann (2008b) analyze the impact of trust on VCs? international investment choices. Progressing naturally, we investigate the impact of cultural differences on international VC success. We measure cultural differences between the countries of VC investors and their portfolio companies using the Hofstede distance.4 Strikingly, we actually find that a higher cultural distance between the lead VC investor and the portfolio  \n\ncompany increases the likelihood of VC success. This result persists when we relate the four individual components of Hofstede distance to international VC success.  \n\nOne possible explanation is VCs, expecting cultural differences, do a better job in screening and due diligence before investing in their portfolio companies. Anticipating cultural differences, if VCs set a higher bar for their investments in culturally distant nations, and yet make those transactions, the investments are likely to be of better than average quality. We test this interpretation in two ways.  \n\nFirst, we exploit the observed tendency of experienced VCs being more likely to be involved in culturally distant transactions, to construct a measure of VC due-diligence and then incorporate it directly in our multivariate analysis of VC success. A significantly positive coefficient on the due-diligence measure would suggest that better screening and evaluation of companies does result in a higher success rate for VC firms. We indeed find this to be the case.  \n\nSecond, we interact cultural distance with an emerging economy indicator to test whether cultural distance has an incremental impact on VC success in emerging economies. We obtain a significantly positive coefficient on the interaction term, which suggests that VCs rationally anticipate significant challenges, originating in part from cultural differences, when investing in emerging economies, and hence spend considerable upfront effort in proper screening and due diligence of those investments. This results in a higher likelihood of VC success. A related test also shows that the coefficient on cultural distance is significantly larger in predicting VC success in emerging economies relative to the developed economies.  \n\nFinally, we analyze the impact of local investor participation on VC success. There exists a large body of research in international business and management, which illustrates that while indigenous firms gain tangible advantages due to their easier access to local information, networks, resources, and knowledge, foreign firms incur higher information and transaction costs arising from their lack of familiarity with the host environment and local cultures. As a result foreign investors suffer from what Kindleberger (1969), Hymer (1960, 1976), and Zaheer (1995) term “liability of foreignness’ or LOF. The extensive literature on “home bias’ draws similar conclusions in terms of performance of investments made in more familiar local environments relative to alien turfs (for example, see Coval and Moskowitz, 2001).  \n\nWhile testing for implications of local VC involvement, we need to control for VC syndication effects, since it has been found to be an important predictor of VC success. We do so in two ways. First, we measure the size of VC syndicate in each portfolio company. Second, we control for whether the VC syndicates contain a U.S. headquartered VC firm. U.S. based VC firms dominate the organized VC industry, and possess extensive VC investment experience by virtue of their long history of venture capital activity. Moreover, U.S. style venture capital contracts have been found to be more efficient in terms of performance which is also reflected in their increased worldwide adoption through the years (Kaplan, Martel, and Stromberg, 2007). Our results indicate VC syndicate size is associated with a higher likelihood of VC success in both developed and emerging economies. VC syndicates containing U.S. headquartered VCs experience a higher level of success as well although only in developed countries.  \n\nMore importantly, when we control for local investor participation, we find that VC syndicates that include both U.S. based and local VCs have a much higher likelihood of success. On the other hand, the indicator denoting presence of a U.S. headquartered VC firm loses its power to predict VC success. This suggests that U.S. headquartered VC firms and local VC investors in venture capital syndicates act as complements, as VC syndicates that include both investor types perform significantly better. While the presence of a U.S. based VC firm brings the benefit of experience and contract design expertise, local VC investor participation helps in mitigating the LOF problem.  \n\nHowever, local investor participation does not affect VC success in emerging countries. This is consistent with the notion that local VC investors from emerging economies are relatively inexperienced, and hence do not have the expertise to exploit their local informational advantage and contribute significantly to the likelihood of portfolio company success.  \n\nThe major contributions of this research are as follows. Motivated by the observation that VC success varies substantially across countries, we analyze the influence of countryspecific institutional and cultural factors on VC success. We believe this study is the first of its kind examining VC investments across several countries and analyzing the determinants of their success. Second, we show that a country's institutional framework-legal system and capital markets-is important in contributing to success of privately-held VC investments. This indicates that the presence of better developed legal institutions and capital markets represent a source of comparative advantage for countries trying to promote entrepreneurship and the venture capital industry. Third, we highlight the influence of cultural differences and local investor participation on VC success. In so doing, we emphasize the importance of both VC screening (due-diligence)  \n\nand monitoring for VC success. Finally, since our dataset is larger and more diverse than those in earlier studies, we separately analyze the sub-samples of developed and emerging economies and provide evidence regarding the determinants of VC success in both types of markets.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature and outlines the testable hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data and provides summary statistics. Section 4 investigates the performance of international venture investments in a multivariate framework. Section 5 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Literature review, hypotheses, and analytical framework  \n\nWe review the extant literature pertaining to international venture capital in this section and outline the testable hypotheses. We discuss each important strand that can potentially affect the likelihood of VC success in a global context, particularly focusing on the institutional and cultural differences across countries.  \n\n### 2.1. Legal rights and protection  \n\nAmong institutional features country-specific legal systems, especially, have a widespread impact on business and economics. For attracting investments, strengthening investor confidence through appropriate laws and regulations is considered particularly important. Regulations on shareholder rights including those that protect minority shareholders and reliable enforcement of shareholder and creditor rights in the event of disputes are critical for creating an attractive investment climate. Furthermore, promoting sound corporate governance standards is equally imperative. Countries that promote and enforce rules related to standardized public disclosure, management accountability, and internationally accepted accounting practices are likely to be favored by investors. Worldwide, over the previous two decades, several countries have instituted reforms that address these important issues aimed at strengthening their local financial markets for attracting foreign investment.  \n\nLa Porta, Lopez de Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1997, 1998)-LLSV hereafter-and several other studies have shown that law matters for financial decision making and valuations. In the VC context, a number of recent studies examine how legal systems influence venture capital contracts; see in particular, Bottazzi, Da Rin and Hellmann (2008a), Cumming, Schmidt and Walz (2008), Kaplan, Martel and Stromberg (2007), and Lerner and Schoar (2005). To examine the impact of legal rights and protection on the likelihood of successful VC exits, Cumming, Fleming, and Schwienbacher (2005) use a sample of countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and provide evidence that better legal rights positively affect the likelihood of VC success. Similarly emphasizing the positive impact of law, Cumming and Walz (2009) show that less stringent accounting standards and weak legal systems appear to facilitate aggressive performance reporting behavior by VC funds when they disclose valuations of their yet unharvested investments. Our analysis of the impact of legal rights and protections on VC success differs from previous research in primarily two ways.  \n\nFirst, we separately analyze the impact of legal rights and protections on the likelihood of VC success in emerging countries, since it is not entirely clear which (or even whether) legal rights and protections matter in emerging economies. For example, Allen et al. (2005) study China’s recent economic growth, and conclude that even though its legal and financial systems are much underdeveloped, yet it has one of the fastest growing economies. In another study on India, another fast growing economy, Allen et al. (2007) provide evidence that many Indian firms conduct business outside the formal legal system and do not rely on formal financing channels from markets and banks for most of their financing needs. On the other hand, Lerner and Schoar (2005) provide evidence that private equity transactions (involving buyouts, corporate acquisitions, distressed firms, company expansion, IPOs, privatizations, and venture capital) in developing countries with better law enforcement have higher post-money valuations. The overall evidence suggests a more complicated system seems to operate in emerging economies rather than the more conventional law-finance-growth nexus.  \n\nSecond, since our dataset is larger and more diverse than those in other studies that analyze the impact of law on VC success, we believe our analyses confer better power on the statistical tests, relative to more homogeneous samples.?  \n\nGiven prior evidence of a mostly positive impact of law on valuations of companies, and also its importance for economic growth and development of financial markets, our null hypothesis captures the idea that countries with better legal regimes and protection are likely to witness a higher proportion of successful VC exits. Our first hypothesis is:  \n\n$H_{I}$ :Better country-specific legal rights and protection positively influence the likelihood of internationalVCsuccess.  \n\nTo capture law, we aggregate the country-specific legal rights and protection into a legal index by adding the shareholder rights, enforcement rights, and accounting standards in each  \n\ncountry. The shareholder rights are aggregated on six indicator variables: one share-one vote, proxy by mail, cumulative voting, oppressed minorities mechanism, preemptive rights, and unblocked shares prior to meetings (source: LLSV), and then divided by their maximum possible value of 6. In a similar vein, the enforcement rights are an amalgam of five law variables: efficiency of judicial system, rule of law, corruption, risk of expropriation and repudiation of contracts, each assigned ten points (source: LLSV and Transparency International). The cumulative enforcement rights thus created are divided by their maximum value of 50. The accounting standards are measured on a scale of O-1oo (Source: LLsV), and we normalize them by their maximum possible value of 100. Finally, we create the country-specific legal index by adding the normalized values of shareholder rights, enforcement rights, and accounting standards for each country.8  \n\n### 2.2. Stock market development  \n\nA vital institutional factor conducive to attracting investment and promoting growth is a well-developed capital market. Financial market development can facilitate economic growth by reducing the costs of external finance to firms (Rajan and Zingales, 1998). A useful indicator of financial development is the ease with which a company or an entrepreneur can obtain financing for their projects based on the quality of the underlying assets or ideas (Rajan and Zingales, 2003). By reducing information and transactions costs and allowing more entrepreneurs to obtain external finance, well-developed capital markets improve the allocation of capital. In general, better functioning financial systems can make financial services available to a larger proportion of the population, rather than restricting capital to entrenched incumbents (Morck, Wolfenzon, and Yeung, 2005).  \n\nWhile Western countries typically have well developed institutions (for example, capital markets) relative to other economies, several countries, particularly emerging economies, have instituted wide ranging reforms to improve the functioning of their institutions. A few of these reforms consisting of legal and regulatory changes are aimed at strengthening the local capital markets to promote foreign investment, availability of capital, and entrepreneurship.  \n\nA key feature of the venture capital industry is harvesting of VC investments. Harvesting provides the venture capitalists the only way to earn consistently profitable returns by converting their illiquid investments into cash. A good performance in harvesting investments considerably facilitates future fundraising, and even when evaluating potential investments, VCs have an eye on the prospective exit avenues available to them. The two profitable exit avenues - IPOs and acquisitions - require well functioning stock markets as a vital catalyst for their occurrence. For instance, stock markets provide potential acquirers much needed acquisition currency, whereby the bidders can use their stock (or a mix of cash and stock) in acquisition transactions. An active and vibrant stock market also creates incentives for increased VC investment activity, leading in turn to an active venture capital industry (Black and Gilson, 1998). Because of the importance of stock markets for (rapid) VC exits from their portfolio companies, we hypothesize that countries with well-developed stock markets are likely to witness a higher likelihood of successful VC exits. Our second hypothesis tests this intuition.  \n\n$H_{2}$ :Better developed stock markets are more conducive for successful VC exits  \n\n### 2.3. Cultural differences  \n\nAn important topic in international business studies is the difference in national cultures across countries, and the resultant impact on different facets of business enterprise. While the importance of cultural issues has received prominent emphasis in other disciplines such as strategic management and international business, their impact on corporate financial decisions is only now being explored. In a recent article, Chakravarti et al. (2008) examine the impact of cultural differences on cross-border acquisitions, and provide evidence that higher cultural differences actually lead to higher announcement returns for acquirers. Relating trust and economic decision making, Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2008) examine the role of trust, originating at least in part from the cultural differences between countries, as a determinant of trade and investment flows between the countries. While Guiso et al. (2008) employ macro-level data two recent studies employ micro-data to examine the role of trust on investment decisions. Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2007) show that trust affects stock market investment decisions in general, while Bottazzi, Da Rin, and Hellmann (2008b) document that trust plays a central role in VC investment decisions as well.  \n\nHowever, the impact of cultural differences on the eventual outcome of international VC investments has not been analyzed. In the VC context, anecdotal evidence suggests that both VCs and entrepreneurs emphasize the importance of mutual trust, for a higher likelihood of their companies′ success. In fact, not being able to build effective working relationships is often regarded as one of the primary causes of failed ventures, even in a relatively homogeneous investing environment as the U.S. Arguably, in international VC investments, differences arising from cultural diversity can be a major source of conflict between company insiders and external investors, with potential to adversely affect VC performance.  \n\nOn the other hand, awareness of cultural differences and related challenges can lead to better ex-ante screening and due diligence, whereby transactions involving high cultural disparity materialize only when they have substantial economic potential.? We hasten to add that all VC transactions are subject to an extensive due-diligence process. However, a higher cultural disparity between the parties is likely to make investors extra-cautious and create incentives for better screening of their porfolio companies, especially involving international transactions. Rosenbloom (2002), for instance, emphasizes the importance of due diligence in all transactions and particularly those involving parties across national borders. Thus, which of the two effectspositive or negative-dominates empirically is an interesting unanswered question that we explore by analyzing the role of cultural differences in VC investment outcomes. We examine the following null and alternative hypotheses:  \n\n$H_{3N}$ : A higher cultural disparity between the VCs and their portfolio companies adversely affects the performance of international VC investments.   \n$H_{3A}$ : A higher cultural disparity between the VCs and their portfolio companies leads to better ex-ante screening and due diligence by VCs thereby positively affecting the performance of internationalVC investments.  \n\nTo test our third hypothesis, we use the Hofstede's measures of country culture to compute cultural differences between countries. Geert Hofstede, in his landmark book on international management, Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work Related Values, explains how cultures evolve by imbibing factors that include climate, economic development and history.  \n\nHofstede classifies culture into four major dimensions - small versus large power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism versus collectivism, and masculinity versus femininity. Power distance measures the degree of equality, or inequality, between people in the country's society. For example, in societies displaying small power distances, people relate to each other more as equals regardless of formal positions. In contrast, in large power distance countries (India, Japan) people tend to accept the power of others simply based on their hierarchical positions. Uncertainty Avoidance captures the society's attitude towards uncertainty and its attempt to cope with anxiety in uncertain situations. Cultures that scored high on  \n\nuncertainty avoidance tend to prefer rule-based societies, and structured circumstances (Mediterranean countries, Japan). Individualism refers to the extent the society helps in reinforcing the individual achievement, whereas collectivism emphasizes collective action by individuals. Latin American societies rank among the most collectivist, while the U.S. is one of the most individualistic cultures. Masculinity reflects the extent to which the society values the traditional 'masculine′ features such as assertiveness, achievement, competitiveness, and the accumulation of materialistic possessions. In contrast, femininity emphasizes relationships and quality of life. Furthermore, a high femininity ranking indicates the country has a low level of differentiation and discrimination between genders. Japan, for example, is considered one of the most “masculine” countries in this regard while Sweden the most “feminine.\" These aspects constitute the four dimensions on which societies are calibrated, and scores assigned to nations.  \n\nResearchers have used the Hofstede measures to calibrate the four dimensions of a society's culture, and then used the differences in the measures to capture the idea of “cultural distance” between the countries. Several studies also report that the Hofstede measure is correlated with other measures of culture or trust; for e.g., Chakrabarti et al. (2008) find that Hofstede's distance measure is positively correlated with the mutual distrust measure of Guiso et al. (2008), indicating that countries with higher cultural distance also display higher mutual distrust. In summary, we note that the Hofstede measure is one of the most used and cited cultural frameworks in international business, management and applied psychology and has been used in several other business disciplines. We compute the cultural distance as follows:  \n\nHofstede cultural distance $:=\\big(\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\big(C_{P C,i}-C_{V C,i}\\big)^{2}\\big)^{1/2}$ where, $C_{P C,i}=$ portfolio company's culture on measure $i$ $C_{V C,i}=$ lead VC's culture on measure i The lead venture capital firm in the VC syndicate is defined as the VC firm that has invested the maximum amount in the portfolio company across all rounds of financing.  \n\n### 2.4. Liability of foreignness, home bias, and local investor participation  \n\nThe institutional, cultural, and social differences among countries further amplify the macroeconomic and company-specific business and technology risks, investors face when investing globally. In general, foreign investors’ unfamiliarity with local investment practices can impact both their investment decisions and success. Theoretical work in international  \n\nbusiness and management ilustrates that while indigenous firms gain tangible advantages due to their easier access to local information, networks, resources, and knowledge, foreign firms incur higher information and transaction costs arising from their lack of familiarity with the host environment, and thereby suffering from what Kindleberger (1969), Hymer (1960, 1976), and Zaheer (1995) term ‘liability of foreignness² or LOF.10  \n\nIn a similar vein, a large body of research has analyzed the “home bias' phenomenon in which investors exhibit preference for local, more familiar investments. For example, Coval and Moskowitz (1999, 2001) show that mutual fund managers prefer to hold locally headquartered firms and also make substantial abnormal returns from local investments. Similarly, Hau (2001) finds that proprietary traders in the German stock market perform better when they are geographically closer to Frankfurt. Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001) also demonstrate that local language and culture have positive impacts on equity shareholdings and trading. Other studies that provide similar evidence in a cross-country setting include Choe, Kho, and Stulz (2005) who analyze Korean stocks and find that foreign investors purchase shares at higher prices than resident investors and sell them at lower prices. Similarly, Shukla and van Inwegen (1995) show that U.K. money managers underperform American money managers when picking U.S. stocks. These studies suggest that home advantage matters, which gets reflected in local investors' investment decisions and performance.  \n\nAs well, local VC investors, by virtue of their familiarity with the companies   \nincorporated in home countries and their access to resources and extended information networks,   \ncould contribute positively in both screening and monitoring VC investments. Bottazzi, Da Rin   \nand Hellmann (2008b) show that the presence of local partners affects VCs’ investment   \ndecisions and that having a local partner from the same country as the company increases the   \nlikelihood of VC investing. We therefore hypothesize that local investor participation in the VC   \nsyndicate contributes positively to the success of portfolio companies. Our fourth hypothesis is:   \n$H_{4}$ :VC syndicates with local investment participation perform better than ones without local VC investors.  \n\nWe test these four hypotheses capturing the possible impact of legal, institutional and cultural differences on the likelihood of VC success using the data assembled on VC investments all over the globe. The next section describes data, their sources, and sample statistics.  \n\n## 3. Data and Sample Statistics  \n\n### 3.1. Data  \n\nWe source the data from SDC VentureXpert database provided by Thomson Financial. We focus on investments made in private companies all over the world, excluding North America.1l The primary sample includes all VC investments made between 1996 and 2002, in companies that received their first round of VC funding beginning in 1996. Since our focus is on analyzing the cross-sectional determinants of VC success in an international setting, we consider all VC investments in our sample of countries, irrespective of whether they are made by local or foreign VCs. Of course, presence of local VCs is essential for analyzing the importance of local investor participation. However, the private equity investments in buy-outs of relatively mature companies do not form a part of the study. Since, we track the performance of portfolio companies until the beginning of 2007, the methodology provides for a minimum of four years for a successful exit, consistent with the analysis in Gompers and Lerner (2000a), Hochberg et al. (2007), and Nahata (2008). Companies that do not exit successfully by the beginning of 2007 are classified as unsuccessful exits.12 Since some of the companies that are private (and coded unsuccessful) at the end of 2006 may eventually exit successfully we primarily employ the Cox hazard framework in our analyses to account for the right-censored feature of our sample, although our results are robust to using the logit models. In addition to analyzing the likelihood of VC success, the hazard models account for timing of the events as well.  \n\nThe information on successful exits - IPOs and acquisitions - is available in the VentureXpert database, and we carefully supplement it with the data from the New Issues database (for IPOs) and M&A database (for company mergers and acquisitions), also provided by Thomson Financial. It is well known that VC firms reap most of their profits from a small sub-sample of their investments that exit either through IPOs or acquisitions. Previous literature including but not limited to Gompers et al. (2008a), Hochberg et al. (2007), Zarutskie (2007), and Nahata (2008) use occurrence of IPOs and acquisitions as a measure of success of VC firms and their portfolio companies. Hochberg et al. (2007) also show that this measure is a reasonable proxy for VC fund returns.  \n\nFrom the VentureXpert database, we extract other relevant information on the portfolio companies and the VCs, including the size of the VC syndicate, identities of the VC investors, identity of the lead VC firm based on the total investment made by each VC firm in the portfolio company, VC age, countries in which VC firms and portfolio companies are headquartered, companies? developmental stage, and their industry.  \n\nOur other sources of data are diverse. We extract the country-specific law variables from the data maintained by LLsV on their website, which we use to construct the cumulative shareholder rights, aggregated enforcement rights, and finally, the legal index. A measure of country-specific corruption, one of the constituents of enforcement rights, is procured from Transparency International. We obtain the Hofstede measures of culture from Geert Hofstede's Website, and use them to compute the cultural distance between the countries of the portfolio company and the lead VC investor. Next, we extract the information on annual number of IPOs in a given country from the SDC's New Issues database, and country population from World Bank World Development Indicators, both of which are used to measure the stock market development in the country. The information on country GDP is also procured from World Bank World Development Indicators. To measure stock market conditions in a given country, we use the country-specific Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indices. Finally, we access the Penn World Tables for data to measure the degree of openness of a given country's economy to international trade. Country GDP, stock market conditions, and country openness allow us to control for macroeconomic conditions.  \n\nWe impose the following filters on our data. First, we exclude VC investments that are made after the company is involved in an IPO or an acquisition, since they are impertinent to our analyses. Second, we exclude countries that did not witness VC investments in at least fifteen companies over the seven-year period to improve the signal to noise ratio and mitigate the adverse impact of outliers. Finally, since we extensively use country-specific information in our analyses, we are limited to focusing on countries covered by all the data sources. Our final data sample consist of VC investments in 9,153 portfolio companies based in 32 countries, for which relevant company, country, and VC firm information are available.  \n\nTable 1 presents the country-wise distribution of VC investments made in developed and emerging economies between 1996 and 2002, and their status at the beginning of 2007. We use the MSCI Barra classification to categorize countres into developed and emerging economies.3 Three points are notable. First, about $23\\%$ of the VC backed portfolio companies are based in emerging economies. Second, no single country dominates the sample: UK, the largest country in terms of number of VC backed portfolio companies, contributes less than $20\\%$ to the sample. Finally, $18.1\\%$ of the VC backed portfolio companies in developed economies are successful, compared to $13.7\\%$ in emerging economies. The successful exit rate-based on IPOs and acquisitions of portfolio companies-is lower than that observed for U.s. based portfolio companies that have exit rates around $25\\%$ (Hochberg et al., 2007; Nahata, 2008).  \n\n### 3.2. Sample Statistics  \n\n#### 3.2.1. Legal rights and protection  \n\nAs discussed before, we construct a country-specific legal index by incorporating the aggregate shareholder rights, cumulative enforcement rights, and accounting standards in each country. The advantage of aggregating these constituents into a single legal index is the reduction in multicollinearity problem that would otherwise occur if these distinct variables are introduced simultaneously in the analyses. For instance, the country-specific accounting standard is significantly correlated with both aggregate shareholder rights $_{\\mathrm{p}=0.46)}$ and cumulative enforcement rights $(\\mathrm{p}{=}0.57)$ ). Not surprisingly, we obtain better power in our tests when we use the legal index rather than the individual components constituting the index. Ceteris paribus, a higher legal index reflects better investor protection, which is not only more conducive for attracting investments, but also results in higher valuations (LLSV, 1997; 1998).  \n\nTable 2 shows the average value of the legal index associated with successful and unsuccessful VC exits. The legal indices differ significantly at the one percent level, suggesting that VC success gets compounded in an atmosphere of better legal protection, which is consistent with Cumming et al. (2005).  \n\nWe also test for differences in the legal indices across successful and unsuccessful VC exits on the sub-samples of developed and emerging economies. The p-values in columns 8 and 11 of Table 2 denote the significance levels for tests of equality of means on data pertaining to developed and emerging countries respectively. Consistent with overall findings, we observe similar significant results in developed countries. Interestingly, legal rights and protections are significantly higher for successful VC exits in emerging economies as well. This finding is analogous to the evidence on private equity transactions reported in Lerner and Schoar (2005).  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Stock market development  \n\nTo assess country-specific stock market development, two commonly used measures are stock market capitalization and aggregate share turnover. However, these measures can be dominated by a few large companies, and may not be sufficiently indicative of the level of a country's stock market development.14 In many countries, particularly emerging, stock market capitalization and share turnover have increased manifold over the years. But, a high market capitalization or trading volume do not necessarily translate into a mature and vibrant stock market where a large number of companies have access to equity capital. Rajan and Zingales (2003) also emphasize that financial systems in which capital availability is restricted to a select few firms, cannot be considered financially developed. Consistent with their argument, Cumming et al. (2005) do not find a significant impact of stock market capitalization on VC success.  \n\nWe therefore construct a novel measure of stock market development, which has a particular relevance for venture capitalists. Our measure is based on IPOs that is the first choice of exit for VCs because of their highest average profitability. We cumulate the number of IPOs that occurred in a country from 1993 up until a given calendar year and normalize it by the population (in million) of that country in the same calendar year. A greater number of IPOs denotes that the country's stock markets are more receptive to equity issues by companies going public, and cumulating the number of IPOs over several years adjusts for fluctuating stock market conditions that may positively or adversely affect the number of stock offerings in certain years. Finally, normalizing the cumulative number of IPOs by population facilitates a more meaningful comparison across countries of different sizes (Rajan and Zingales, 2003). We measure the country's stock market development prior to the year of first VC investment in the portfolio company. Thus for example, in case of companies initially funded in 1996, stock  \n\nmarket development is based on cumulative IPOs in the country between 1993 and 1995, and the population in 1995.15  \n\nWe observe from Table 2 that stock market development significantly facilitates VCs' successful exits. Consistent with Black and Gilson (1998), the measure of stock market development associated with successful VC exits is significantly higher than that associated with unsuccessful VC exits. This pattern holds for VC exits restricted individually to developed and emerging economies as well. The mean values of stock market development across all investments (not reported) are 9.74 for developed countries and 4.14 for emerging economies.  \n\n#### 3.2.3. Cultural differences  \n\nAs mentioned earlier, we use the Hofstede's measures of country culture to account for the cultural differences between countries. Recall, that we compute the cultural distance based on the four measures of country culture-power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism, and masculinity-as follows:  \n\nHostedeulualistane=(Cpc:-Cvc:)1/2 4  \n\nwhere, $C_{P C,i}=$ portfolio company's culture on measure $i$ $C_{V C,i}=$ lead VC's culture on measure i  \n\nTable 2 reports the measures of cultural distance between the portfolio companies, and their lead VC investors for successful and unsuccessful exits. The average cultural difference of 4.42 for successful exits is significantly higher than 3.29 for unsuccessful exits.1° This is consistent with the expectation that VCs are more careful in deal screening and due diligence before investing in culturally distant countries. We also obtain significant differences in cultural distance across the two categories of VC exits in both developed and emerging economies.  \n\n#### 3.2.4. Local investor participation  \n\nSyndication of investments is a characteristic feature of the VC industry with a majority of investments having co-investors. In general, syndication spreads the VCs’ risk, allows for an independent appraisal on the start-ups potential, and increases monitoring and management  \n\nsupport. Moreover, there is likely to be a quid pro quo arrangement among syndicate members to participate in future VC syndicates led by other VC firms. In the VC context, Lerner (1994a) provides the first evidence that VC syndication positively influences company success through better deal screening, due diligence, and complementary value added by syndication partners. Using data from Canadian VC investments, Brander, Amit, and Antweiler (2002) provide evidence that syndicated VC deals have higher returns. More recently, using U.S. data, Nahata (2008) shows that syndicated deals have a higher likelihood of success. In light of previous evidence, we control for VC syndication in our analyses which also allows us to shed light on whether VC syndication contributes to the success of portfolio companies internationally.  \n\nWe determine the performance implications of syndication in multiple ways. First, we measure the size of the VC syndicate in each portfolio company. The average VC syndicate comprises of 4.3 (3.4) VCs for successful (unsuccessful) portfolio companies with the difference being significant at the one percent level.  \n\nSecond, we control for the presence of a U.S. based VC firm in the venture capital syndicate. Since U.S. headquartered VCs have been around for a longer time period and the U.S. is by far the biggest VC market in the world, on average, we expect U.S. based VCs to be more experienced and more likely to lead their portfolio companies to successful exits. Furthermore, U.S. style venture capital contracts have been found to be more efficient both in terms of performance as well as their increased worldwide adoption through the years (Kaplan, Martel, and Stromberg, 2007). In line with our expectation, we find that portfolio companies that have U.S. based VCs in their syndicates are more likely to be successful. Of the portfolio companies that exited successfully (unsuccessfully), $26.7\\%$ $(17.4\\%)$ involved a U.S. based VC firm in the VC syndicate, and this difference is significant at the one percent level.  \n\nUpon restricting our analysis individually to the developed and emerging economies, we continue to find that larger VC syndicates and presence of a U.S. based VC firm are significantly more likely to be associated with successful VC exits. The average syndicate comprises of 4.7 (3.8) VCs for successful (unsuccessful) portfolio companies in developed countries, and 2.6 (2.0) VCs for successful (unsuccessful) VC exits in emerging economies. In developed countries, of the portfolio companies that exit successfully (unsuccessfully), $27\\%$ $(18.6\\%)$ involve a U.S. based VC firm in their VC syndicates, while in emerging economies the respective percentages are $25.8\\%$ and $13.8\\%$  \n\nMore importantly, our third element of VC syndication is local investor participation, which as theory predicts, should mitigate the LOF problem. Our data, that include VC  \n\ninvestments by both local and foreign investors, give us a unique opportunity to ascertain the value added by local investors in the VC syndicate. For determining the performance implications of local investor participation, we interact the indicators for U.S. based VC firm and local VC investor in the VC syndicate.f7 Given the evidence above, a U.S. based VC firm is expected to positively contribute by way of experience and VC industry expertise, while local VC investor participation is likely to mitigate the LOF problem. In line with our expectation, we find that VC syndicates containing both U.S. headquartered VC firms and local VC investors are nearly twice as likely to lead their portfolio companies to successful exits. Of the portfolio companies that exit successfully (unsuccessfully), $14.2\\%$ $(7.7\\%)$ involve both a U.S. based VC firm and a local VC investor in their VC syndicates. We obtain similar significant differences in the sub-samples of developed and emerging economies.  \n\n#### 3.2.5. Other control variables  \n\nThere is consistent evidence in U.S. venture capital market that experienced VCs attract better companies as well as provide better monitoring and supervision to their portfolio companies thus increasing the chances of their success. For example, Lerner (1994b), Hochberg et al. (2007), Sorensen (2007), and Nahata (2008) show that more experienced VCs have a significant positive impact on their portfolio companies. We control for VC experience in our analyses and use the age of the lead VC firm to measure its VC industry experience. We focus on the experience of the lead VC investor since the lead VC will have the most influence in the VC syndicate and is also most likely to have one or more board seats (Barry et al., 1990; Gompers, 1996). The lead VC firm is defined as the VC with the largest investment in the portfolio company. We measure the lead VC age in the year prior to its first investment in the portfolio company. The average age of the lead VCs whose portfolio companies exit successfully (unsuccessfully) is 13.77 (11.37) years, the difference being statistically significant. We obtain significant differences in VC experience across successful and unsuccessful exits individually in developed and emerging countries as well.  \n\nBeginning with Lerner (1994b), several studies have shown VCs timing their exits, particularly the IPOs, with \\*better' market conditions. More recently, Hochberg et al. (2007)  \n\nprovide evidence that better stock market conditions facilitate successful VC exits through IPOs and acquisitions. To account for the impact of market conditions on VC exits, we specifically control for the exit market environment using the country-specific MSCI stock indices.  \n\nFirst, we compute the country-specific six-monthly MSCI stock index return prior to the successful exit of each portfolio company based in that country. This measure is lagged by a quarter so as to allow a typical company and its investors up to three months to prepare for an impending exit by way of an IPO or an acquisition. Second, for unsuccessful exits we use the average of the country-specific six-monthly MSCI stock index returns computed on a monthly rolling basis over the entire time period from the porfolio company's initial funding year until 2006, when VC exits could occur.  \n\nAs observed in Table 2, the average six-monthly stock index return is significantly different across successful and unsuccessful exits. Analyzing separately the developed and emerging economies, we do not observe a significant impact of stock market conditions on VC success in emerging countries. On the other hand, in developed countries we do find that better stock market conditions are positively related to the likelihood of VC success in a statistically significant way.  \n\nWe control for a country's macro-economy through two other factors: the natural logarithm of GDP, and the country's openness to trade. As observed from Table 2, the average country GDP is higher for companies that exit successfully through IPOs or acquisitions. We obtain a similar qualitative pattern in country GDP when analyzing developed economies. However, when restricting our analysis to emerging economies, the pattern reverses, and the average country GDP is significantly lower for companies that exit through IPOs or acquisitions.  \n\nThe country's openness to trade - defined as the ratio of total trade including exports and imports to country GDP - has a significantly negative impact on VC success. Similar to country GDP, the country's openness to trade is measured as of the year prior to the year of first VC investment in the portfolio company. The average measure of country's openness is significantly lower for companies that exit successfully through IPOs or acquisitions. A similar qualitative pattern emerges for VC exits in developed countries. This is somewhat consistent with the notion that more open countries are relatively more attractive for VCs, and increased competition among VCs for prospective deals in these countries results in the ^money chasing deals? scenario, depressing VC performance (Gompers and Lerner, 2000b). However, when restricting our analysis to emerging economies, a country's openness is not significantly different across the two categories of VC exits.  \n\nFinally, we create an indicator variable denoting whether the first investment in the portfolio company occurred at the ^seed’ or ^early’ stage of development. Companies in early stages of development are likely to be riskier and this may impact their performance. Consistent with this logic, we observe that among successful (unsuccessful) exits, $31.8\\%$ $(43.2\\%)$ of all VC investments were first made at the seed/early stage, the difference being statistically significant. This pattern holds strongly in a significant way in both developed and emerging economies.  \n\n#### 3.2.6. Correlation of variables  \n\nNext, we discuss the pair-wise correlations of the primary variables used in our empirical tests. As observed from Table 3, legal index is not very correlated with variables measuring cultural distance $(\\mathsf{p}{=}{-}0.04)$ and local investor participation ( $\\scriptstyle(\\mathrm{=}0.06)$ . The legal index is moderately correlated with country GDP $\\scriptstyle(\\mathrm{p}{=}0.12)$ indicating that higher GDP countries also have better legal rights and protections. On the other hand, it is highly correlated with stock market development $(\\mathrm{p}{=}0.60)$ 0.18 The stock market development is also positively correlated with country openness ( $_{\\mathrm{\\scriptsize~0=0.38,}}$ ); however its correlations with other variables are low.  \n\nThe correlations of cultural distance with our primary variables measuring legal rights and protections, stock market development and local investor participation are relatively low. However, cultural difference is highly correlated with the two variables that measure VC experience; its correlation with lead VC age being 0.21 and with the indicator variable denoting U.S. VC presence in the syndicate being 0.48. These relatively high correlations suggest that better experienced VCs are more likely to invest in companies from culturally distant nations. This is also consistent with the notion that the better due-diligence and screening abilities of more experienced VCs enable them to be successful in culturally distant transactions.  \n\nThe three variables that capture VC syndication-size of the VC syndicate, presence of a U.S. based VC firm, and presence of both a U.S. based VC firm and a local VC firm-are highly correlated with each other as expected. However, the indicator denoting presence of both a U.S. based VC firm and a local VC firm in the syndicate (measuring local investor participation) is not highly correlated with our other primary variables measuring law, cultural distance, and stock market development. Overall, the low correlations among most variables alleviate to a large degree, potential concerns about multicollinearity.  \n\n## 4. Multivariate analysis of VC success in international VC investing  \n\nWe now turn to a multivariate analysis of VC success likelihood, where potential determinants of VC success are more precisely controlled for in the Cox hazard framework.  \n\n### 4.1. Performance of VCs in international VC investing  \n\nWe analyze the determinants of global VC success in a Cox hazard framework and present the results in Table 4. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of time to exit which is measured from the date of first VC investment in the portfolio company. The Cox model is a semi-parametric model in which the hazard function is not dependent on a specific distribution of the survival time. The time to exit is censored for unsuccessful VC investments that have not exited by the beginning of 2007. In the Cox hazard framework, a positive (negative) coefficient on the variable implies a higher (lower) hazard for that variable and hence a lower (higher) expected duration. In other words, given that the company is still private at time $t{-}I$ , the hazard at time $t$ is the probability that the company will successfully exit through an IPO or an acquisition.  \n\nWe relate the likelihood of company success to the following variables: legal index, stock market development, Hofstede cultural distance, an indicator variable denoting presence of a U.S. based VC firm and a local VC investor in the VC syndicate, VC experience, VC syndicate size, stock market conditions at the time of exit, country GDP, country openness, and an indicator variable denoting investment by the lead VC at the seed or early stage of company's development. Though not reported in the tables, we include industry indicators for each portfolio company, using the VentureXpert industry definitions. Broadly, the data cover and specify the following six industries: biotechnology, communications/media, computer related, medical/health/life science, non high-technology, and semiconductors/other electronics. By including industry indicators, we also partially account for differences in technological and industrial characteristics of the portfolio companies.  \n\nWhile models 1 and 2 in Table 4 are estimated without one of the measures of VC experience (lead VC age), model 3 contains lead VC age. We estimate these models sequentially because data limitations decrease the sample size. Across the models 1-3, we observe that a higher value of legal index has a positive impact on the likelihood of VC success, which is consistent with Cumming et al. (2005). Thus better legal rights and protection not only attract investments, but also have an appreciable impact on their success. In terms of economic  \n\nsignificance, based on the estimates in models 1-3, a one standard deviation increase in the legal index is associated with a $21.8\\%{-}24.7\\%$ increase in the hazard of a VC's successful exit.  \n\nConsistent with the Black and Gilson (1998) theory on the linkage between stock market development and VC industry growth, we find that developed stock markets have a strong positive impact on VC performance. Better developed stock markets facilitate successful VC exits through IPOs and acquisitions spurring future VC industry growth. A one standard deviation increase in stock market development is associated with a $9.4\\%\\cdot11.4\\%$ increase in the hazard of a VC's successful exit depending on the estimates in models 1-3.  \n\nWe find that in all specifications, cultural distance has a positive impact on VC performance, consistent with the hypothesis that VCs investing in culturally distant nations are aware of cultural disparities, and take meaningful steps in terms of better screening and due diligence of their portfolio companies, which results in better performance. A one standard deviation increase in Hofstede's cultural distance is associated with a $9.3\\%{-}12.1\\%$ increasein the hazard of a VC's successful exit, based on the three model configurations. There is thus no evidence that cultural disparities between nations negatively impacts international VC performance. The finding of a positive impact of cultural distance on VC performance is consistent with the evidence presented in Chakrabarti et al. (2008) in the context of performance of cross-border acquisitions.  \n\nConsistent with the findings in Brander et al. (2002) and Nahata (2008), VC syndication, captured by the size of VC syndicate, has a beneficial impact on company performance. We also find that the presence of a U.S. headquartered VC firm in the VC syndicate has a positive impact on portfolio company performance, but only when we do not control for local investor presence.  \n\nIn models 2 and 3, we account for local investor participation to test whether presence of local VCs has a beneficial impact on company performance. Local VC investors based in the same country as the portfolio company, can have an advantage in locating more promising investments, and can positively contribute in terms of pre-investment screening and due diligence, and post investment monitoring. To test this hypothesis we add an indicator variable that denotes presence of both a U.S. based VC firm and a local VC investor in the venture capitalist syndicate. A significant positive coefficient on this indicator variable will suggest that the participation of both a U.S. based VC firm and a local VC firm results in better portfolio company performance. We find this indeed to be the case; furthermore, the indicator variable denoting the presence of a U.S. based VC firm in the VC syndicate is rendered insignificant. This suggests that local VC investor participation in conjunction with investment by a U.S.  \n\nbased VC firm is really the primary channel (rather than simply the presence of a U.S. based VC firm) that positively affects VC and portfolio company performance. In terms of economic significance, the indicator capturing local investor participation is associated with a $10.1\\%-$ $10.7\\%$ increase in the hazard of a VC's successful exit based on the models in Table 4. In summary, our primary results are strongly supportive of the four hypotheses.  \n\nOur other results are as follows. When introduced in model 3, we find that lead VC age has a significant positive coefficient suggesting that VC experience has a beneficial impact on international VC investing as well. Experienced VCs are able to replicate success across national boundaries. Across all specifications, we find stock market conditions, measured by the sixmonthly return on country-specific MSCI index prior to VC exits, strongly influence the likelihood of successful VC exits. The variable denoting country's openness has a marginally significant negative coefficient in the third model, consistent with our univariate findings. The coefficient on country GDP is positive but not significant in any of the models. Finally, lead VCs that make investments at the seed or early stage in a company's lifecycle are more likely to fail, which is a reflection of the riskier nature of early stage investments.  \n\n### 4.2. Performance of VCs in developed and emerging economies  \n\nThere has been a recent spate of interest in emerging market investing. As mentioned earlier, approximately $23\\%$ of the VC-backed companies in our sample are based in emerging economies. While it is interesting to study the determinants of VC success in general, it is informative to analyze the incremental impact of institutional and cultural differences on VC success in emerging countries relative to the developed economies. In a related test, we analyze the determinants of VC success in sub-samples of developed and emerging economies as well.  \n\nIn Table 5, we first analyze the incremental impact of institutional and cultural differences on VC success in emerging economies relative to the developed countries, by introducing an indicator variable, which denotes whether or not the portfolio company belongs to an emerging economy. Along with this indicator, we introduce interactions of the emerging economy dummy with i) Hofstede culture distance, and i) local investor participation. We do not include interactions of the emerging economy dummy with legal index and stock market development, since these interactions are very highly correlated with the emerging economy indicator itself. The correlation of emerging economy dummy with its interaction with legal index is 0.996, and with its interaction with stock market development is 0.751. The two variables capturing interactions-legal index interacted with emerging economy dummy and  \n\nstock market development interacted with emerging economy dummy-are also highly correlated $(\\uprho{=}0.779)$  \n\nAs before, the variable denoting local investor participation is introduced in model 2 and lead VC age in model 3. While our primary variables of interest-legal index, Hofstede culture distance, local investor participation, and stock market development-continue to stay significant, mirroring our earlier results, our main focus is on the emerging economy indicator and its interactions. The emerging economy indicator itself is not significant in any of the models although it possesses a negative coefficient, which is consistent with our univariate finding that VC success rate is lower in emerging economies than developed countries.  \n\nThe interaction of emerging economy dummy and the Hofstede culture distance is significantly positive, suggesting that a higher cultural disparity between the lead VC investors and their portfolio companies based in emerging economies is associated with a higher likelihood of VC success. VCs rationally anticipate significant cultural differences and the potential challenges arising thereby when investing in emerging countries, and hence are likely to spend significant upfront effort in proper screening and due diligence of these investments. Thus, if VCs set a higher bar for their investments in culturally distant nations, particularly in more risky emerging economies, and yet make those transactions, the investments are likely to be of better than average quality. In turn, this leads to a higher likelihood of VC success.19  \n\nOn the other hand, the interaction of emerging economy dummy and the indicator denoting local investor participation is significant in one of the two specifications. This interaction carries a negative coefficient that suggests that local investor participation is more important for VC success in developed economies than emerging economies. Local investors in emerging economies are likely to be inexperienced in venture capital investing and are therefore unable to exploit their home advantage to contribute significantly to the likelihood of portfolio companysuccess.  \n\nWe next analyze the determinants of VC success separately in developed and emerging economies by utilizing the same set of explanatory variables as earlier and report the results in Table 6. These analyses allow us to report the determinants of VC success in both developed and emerging economies separately and also provide robustness for our earlier findings.  \n\nWhile models 1 and 2 pertain to the developed country sample, the latter two models report the analyses on emerging economies. The overall results indicate that legal index, Hofstede culture distance, and stock market development continue to be robust predictors of VC success internationally, in both developed and emerging economies. On the other hand, while local investor participation matters in developed economies, it does not emerge significant in emerging countries, which is consistent with the results in Table 5. VC experience measured by lead VC age is a significant predictor of company performance in developed countries but not in emerging economies. However, syndication captured by the size of VC syndicate is economically important in both types of economies. Consistent with our univariate comparisons, stock market conditions are strong predictors of VC success in developed countries but not in emerging economies. While country GDP is largely insignificant in predicting VC success in both types of economies, country openness has significantly negative coefficients, consistent with our earlier findings. Finally companies that are funded at their seed or early stages are significantly less likely to succeed irrespective of where they are based.  \n\nThe significance of legal index and stock market development suggests that economically emerging nations desiring to spur local VC industry should take adequate steps to improve their legal systems and develop their stock markets. While a better legal system is prone to attract investors in general, it is immensely important for venture capital investors that face considerable information asymmetries, both at the company level and the macroeconomic level, when they invest in emerging companies. Effective enforcement of law is likely to significantly mitigate VCs? risk, which is markedly higher in emerging countries.  \n\nIn a similar vein, stock market development matters as well. The venture capital activity is best characterized as a cycle constituting primarily four activities - fund raising, sorting/investing, monitoring, and harvesting. The success of VCs in the last stage-harvestingwhich is crucially dependent on exits through IPOs and acquisitions significantly contributes to VC reputation, which in turn critically helps in their next round of fundraising. As much as availability of investment opportunities, their selection, and their monitoring are important, harvesting and adequate channels to realize successful VC exits are equally important for the development of the VC industry and its ecosystem.  \n\n### 4.3. Cultural distance, due diligence, and VC success  \n\nAs mentioned earlier, cultural distance between the portfolio company and the lead VC investor is likely to be associated with a higher degree of distrust that essentially arises from the macro-level unfamiliarity surrounding the portfolio company. While VC investments, to begin with, are fraught with risk, investing in unfamiliar cultures further multiplies the uncertainty for non-local VC firms. To mitigate risk, VC firms are likely to engage in more rigorous screening and evaluation of their portfolio companies, particularly those from unfamiliar cultures. Furthermore, VC firms with better screening and evaluation technology are more likely to invest in culturally distant nations by taking advantage of their better due diligence capabilities. Our evidence on a significant positive correlation of 0.21 between the lead VC age and cultural distance supports this conjecture, and suggests more experienced firms are better inclined to invest in culturally distant countries.  \n\nWhile we conjecture that a higher cultural distance is associated with increased screening and due diligence which then leads to a better success record for VCs, we can more formally exploit the observed tendency of experienced VCs being more likely to be involved in culturally distant transactions, to construct a measure of VC due-diligence and then incorporate it directly in our multivariate analysis. A significantly positive coefficient on the due-diligence measure would support the idea that better screening and evaluation of companies does result in a higher success rate for VC firms. Although imperfect, this is our modest attempt to construct a measure of due-diligence and determine its impact on VC success, given the inherent challenge in measuring a latent variable like due-diligence.  \n\nIn the formal test, we first regress VC experience (lead VC age) on Hofstede culture distance and obtain the fitted values and residuals. The fitted value obtained is likely to be correlated with that aspect of VC experience that is best explained by culture distance. VC experience (or reputation) is essentially based on VC's track record, ability, and expertise, and is likely to reflect both screening and monitoring capabilities of the VC firm. Since higher cultural disparity is likely to be associated with more thorough screening and evaluation, and the VC age is measured at the time of VC's first investment in the portfolio company, the fitted values largely reflect VCs’ due-diligence of their portfolio companies, when VCs first invest in them. On the other hand, the residuals largely capture aspects of VC experience related to the value added by the VCs as they monitor and manage the portfolio companies to successful exits.  \n\nHaving broken down VC experience into two elements one of which arguably measures VC due-diligence, we introduce the two components-fitted values and residuals in our regressions predicting VC success. The model configurations are those reported in Table 7. We use the fitted values and residuals from the first stage while excluding Hofstede culture distance and VC experience (lead VC age) from our specifications. To study the importance of VC duediligence in emerging economies, we interact the fitted value with the emerging economy indicator. Significant positive coefficients on both the fitted value and the interaction variable would support the hypothesis that VC investment in culturally distant nations, and particularly in emerging economies, is related with better ex-ante screening and evaluation of portfolio companies, which in turn results in a higher likelihood of success. Indeed, our results in Table 7 show that the fitted value (measuring VC due diligence) as well as its interaction with emerging economy indicator are highly significant across all specifications.?° Our other primary results on the influence of law, stock market development, and local investor participation on VC success continue to be robust across all models.  \n\n### 4.4. Robustness tests  \n\nThe Hofstede cultural distance captures in aggregate, four aspects of culture - power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism vs. collectivism, and masculinity vs. femininity. To determine the importance of individual cultural elements, we replicate our analyses of Table 4 by introducing each of the four cultural aspects sequentially in place of the aggregate measure of culture distance. Specifically, we use the absolute value of the difference between lead VC's and portfolio company's cultures, measured on each of the four dimensions. For example, to measure the cultural disparity reflected in power distance when a U.S. based VC firm invests in India, we use the absolute value of the difference between power distances of the two individual countries, U.S. and India. We code similarly for the other three dimensions of culture. Not surprisingly, all the four dimensions of cultural distance are highly correlated with each other.  \n\nWe report the most inclusive, the third model of Table 4 for each of the four dimensions of cultural distance. Table 8 which presents the results of this analysis shows that cultural distance measured on each of the four components emerges significant in predicting VC success. However, the economic significance varies among the four elements of culture. Depending on the cultural element, a one standard deviation increase in cultural distance is associated with a $4.5\\%{-9.4\\%}$ increase in the hazard of a VC's successful exit.  \n\nFor further robustness, we consider the Eurobarometer measure of bilateral trust among nations used in Guiso et al. (2008) and Bottazzi et al. (2008b). Chakrabarti et al. (2008) find a negative correlation between the Hofstede culture distance and the Eurobarometer measure, which indicates that higher cultural distance between countries is associated with lower level of mutual trust. We replace the Hofstede distance with the Eurobarometer measure in all our regression specifications although we lose more than half the observations since many countrypairs in our sample are not covered by the Eurobarometer surveys. In all specifications we obtain a negative coefficient on the bilateral trust measure which suggests that lower level of trust between the countries of the lead VC investor and the portfolio company leads to a higher probability of a successful VC exit. Although in some specifications, the negative coefficient is not significant, the overall evidence is consistent with our earlier results.21 We do not intend to claim that a higher level of trust, which has been shown to influence VC investment decisions, results in a lower level of success. Rather, a higher level of mutual distrust and awareness of cultural differences among the parties makes investors cautious and creates incentives for better ex-ante screening and due diligence, so transactions involving high cultural disparity or distrust materialize only when they have substantial economic potential. Such careful investment in portfolio companies leads to a relatively higher likelihood of VC success.  \n\nNext, we evaluate the robustness of our results using two different measures of countryspecific stock market development. Recall that our primary variable is based on the cumulative number of IPOs in a country normalized by its population. Our first alternate variable is based on the cumulative number of IPOs in a country divided by the cumulative GDP of the country. As before, we measure the stock market development prior to the year of first VC investment in the portfolio company. For our analyses, we create an indicator variable that equals one when the stock market development is greater than or equal to the median value in the sample, and zero otherwise. Among successful (unsuccessful) portfolio companies, about $55\\%$ $(49\\%)$ belonged to countries with better developed stock markets, the percentages being significantly different from each other. When we replicate our analyses (with one exception) using this alternate measure, we continue to find that developed stock markets are an important factor for VC success. The one exception is when introduced simultaneously with legal index this measure of stock market development is not significant, which could be due to the high correlation of 0.50 between the two variables.  \n\nOur second alternate measure of stock market development is based on the number of listed companies in a country. We divide the number of listed companies by the country population, and create an indicator variable equal to one when the stock market development is greater than or equal to the median value in the sample, and zero otherwise. Among successful (unsuccessful) portfolio companies, about $62\\%$ $50\\%$ belonged to countries with better developed stock markets, the percentages being significantly different from each other. When using this measure, most results remain qualitatively unchanged. One exception again is when simultaneously introduced with the legal index, this measure of stock market development is not significant, probably caused by the very high collinearity $(\\mathrm{{\\bar{p}}{=}0.75})$ )between the two variables.  \n\nFinally, we re-estimate our results explicitly accounting for endogeneity resulting from possible matching of better portfolio companies with more experienced VCs. In so doing we address the potential concern that better experienced VCs that are more prone to investing in culturally distant nations, simply happen to match with better quality companies. This two-sided matching may account for a higher likelihood of VC success, rather than the VCs' due-diligence ability. To address this issue we use a variation of Heckman's (1979) endogeneity correction procedure and first model an experienced VC's likelihood of investing in a portfolio company, in a probit framework. The dependent variable in the selection equation equals unity when the lead VC's age is greater than or equal to the age of the top quartile of all lead VCs that invested in a given year, and zero otherwise. The explanatory variables reflect characteristics of the portfolio company, investee country, and the lead VC firm, and include the total amount of VC funding received by the portfolio company, the legal index of the investee country, its stock market development and GDP, and indicator variables for the three countries (US, UK, and South Korea) whose lead VC firms account for at least ten percent of VC investments in our sample. We report two specifications for the first stage, one with and the other without Hofstede culture distance to establish robustness. Since cultural distance is related to VCs’ investment sorting, we believe the two different specifications better alleviate concerns about potential endogeneity affecting our results. In the second stage, we add the inverse Mills ratio received from the first-step probit regression as an additional regressor in the hazard analysis of VC success. The results are reported in Table 9.  \n\nThe results from the selection equation estimation indicate that an investment by experienced lead VC is more likely if the portfolio company is of better quality and receives higher VC funding, which is consistent with the two-sided matching. Also, when the investee country has a higher GDP, experienced VCs are more likely to invest. Less experienced VCs are apt to avoiding countries having lower legal protections, which explains the negative coefficient on legal index. Expectedly, lead VC firms from the US and UK are more likely to be experienced. Finally, consistent with the results in Table 7, experienced lead VCs are more likely to invest in culturally distant transactions. The specification of the selection equation is notable since most explanatory variables in the predictive model of experienced VC backing are statistically significant. More importantly, the inverse Mills ratio emerges significant in both the second-stage models (the last specification of Table 4) but even so our main results remain qualitatively and quantitatively unchanged. Thus, while it is important to control for the selection bias associated with VCs’ choice of (and the quality of) their portfolio companies our primary results continue to remain robust.  \n\n## 5. Concluding remarks  \n\nWe provide an analysis of the cross sectional determinants of success in international venture capital (VC) investing. To do so, we assemble the largest-to-date dataset comprising international VC investments in both developed and emerging economies. Using these data, we test hypotheses that relate institutional and cultural differences among countries to the likelihood of VC and portfolio company success.  \n\nSpecifically, we capture these differences by the variation in their legal rights and protection, the extent of stock market development, and cultural differences between the countries of companies and their VC investors. We find these factors strongly impact the likelihood of VC success in both developed and emerging economies. We also analyze the impact of presence of local investor participation that serves to mitigate the “liability of foreignness′ problem arising from the institutional and cultural disparities among countries. While the presence of local investors in VC syndicates increases the likelihood of company success in developed countries, it does not have a significant impact on company success in emerging economies. This indicates venture capital investing is a relatively recent phenomenon in most emerging countries, and therefore local investors may not possess relevant expertise and experience to enhance the likelihood of portfolio company success. Finally, we provide evidence consistent with the notion that VCs are likely to engage in more intensive screening and duediligence when they invest in culturally distant nations and particularly in emerging economies, which in turn contributes significantly to VC success.  \n\nIt is noteworthy that the institutional and cultural factors identified in this study have particular relevance for three of the four critical activities of VC firms. Apart from fundraising, the other three key activities of any VC firm are identifying and sorting potential investments, adding value by provision of monitoring and expertise, and harvesting investments. The key to success in future fundraising and formation of VC reputation lies in the profitable fulfillment of these three activities. In particular, cultural distance has implications for VC sorting activity, local investor participation for screening and monitoring of portfolio companies, and institutional differences (law and capital markets) for both sorting and harvesting of investments.  \n\nIn summary, our analysis extends previous research by identifying the legal, institutional, and cultural factors that influence the success of international VC investments. These findings help provide important guidance for nations considering developing venture capital markets to spur innovation and promote entrepreneurship.  \n\nReferences   \nAllen, F., Qian, J., and M.

This paper traces the origins of dealing with the 'problem' of having to convert large accumulations of cash into appreciating assets. It puts venture capitalists in the US at the center of this history. Charting venture capital's 1950s emergence, 1960s formalization, and 1970s institutionalization, I show how early venture capital investors built a financial infrastructure that safeguarded the appreciation of their assets. Venture capitalists' influence increased as institutional investors (as funders) and startup employees (as investees) became enrolled in this infrastructure and oriented their actions toward its imperatives. I argue that in their handling of abundance, venture capitalists constructed and deepened asset-driven inequalities. Empirically, the paper makes a contribution by demonstrating that vast accumulations of (personal) wealth played a decisive role in this process and highlights the importance of stark inequality well before the neoliberal turn or quantitative easing. Conceptually, I show that venture capitalists' solution to a personal problem became useful at a much larger scale. The paper argues that we should read this influence as conditioned on elite surplus and access to a financial infrastructure.  \n\n# KEYWORDS  \n\nVenture capital; financialization; infrastructure; asset economy; limited partnership; abundance  \n\n## Introduction  \n\nSince 2008, scholars have tried to make sense of what is causing both ultra-low interest rates and worldwide stagnation, with many citing an abundance of capital. For some, this is excessive savings in industrialized countries, and China specifically, whose ‘savings glut (Bernanke, 2015) is driving ‘secular stagnation’ (Summers, 2016). More recently, others have highlighted the emergence of a ‘saving glut of the rich (Mian et al., 2020): a substantial growth in savings among the top $1\\%$ of the income and wealth distribution in the US. This concentrated accumulation of capital means that it becomes increasingly difficult to find profitable outlets for investment. This was further aggravated by over a decade of expansive monetary policy, during which major central banks like the Fed injected vast amounts of liquidity into the financial system (Schwartz, 2016a). This policy coupled quantitative easing with ultra-low interest rates, ensuring cheap credit and driving down yields on bonds. In their search for yield, investors increasingly funneled capital toward riskier forms of equity investment.  \n\nVenture capitalists (VCs), investors pursuing high-risk investments in technology startups, have borne the brunt of this tidal wave of capital. In the US, venture capital investment increased 7-fold between 2008 and its peak in 2021 to a volume ofUS $\\$254$ billion (OECD, 2022). Montalban et al. (2019) argue that the global growth of inequalities [...] creates surplus savings on a global scale and a significant part of these are attracted to Silicon Valley's eco-system based on the proximity of venture capital and the new economy’ (p. 809). Venture capitalists, in turn, react to this abundance of funding' (Kenney & Zysman, 2019, p. 40) by investing money into ‘unprofitable and unproven tech companies’ (Srnicek, 2016, p. 30). This matters because despite their small footprint relative to the overall financial sector, venture capitalists wield considerable influence over our financialized economy (Epstein, 2005; Krippner, 2012). In 2020, seven out of the 10 largest companies by market capitalization were VC-funded (Cooiman, 2023) and VC has been centrally important in creating the tech-driven growth paradigm made famous by Silicon Valley and espoused in OECD countries around the world (Rothstein, 2022). This paper aims to make sense of VCs as agents of abundance in a financialized environment.  \n\nVenture capitalists’ historical role in enabling the handling of abundance, and deepening inequalities, has so far received little attention. This paper argues that VCs pioneered solutions to absorb and invest large accumulations of cash. When this became a ready-made solution in the 2010s, VCs drove the financialization of the startup by funding and sustaining new (and often unprofitable) business models, changed industries by exercising discretion over where abundant funds were to be deployed, extended the reach of institutional investors as these form the funding base for most venture capital investment, and used the inflow of capital for personal enrichment. This way, VCs deepened asset-driven inequalities.  \n\nEmpirically, the paper demonstrates that vast accumulations of (personal) wealth played a decisive role in this process and should be read as an important pre-history to typical focal points of the financialization literature. Beginning in the 1950s, there is a consistent theme of elites and wealthy individuals looking to deploy excess cash. Channeling abundance preceded the deregulation of financial markets in the 1970s and 1980s and the financialization of the firm in the 1980s and 1990s. Even though VC funds form and functioning perfectly catered to the post-2008 macroeconomic environment, they had been up and running decades prior. This highlights the importance of stark inequality well before the neoliberal turn or quantitative easing.  \n\nThe central problem that VCs needed to solve was how to convert large quantities of capital into quickly appreciating equity investments or assets. The paper here builds on recent scholarship that has highlighted the importance of assets for capitalist dynamics (Adkins et al., 2020; Braun, 2016, 2020; Christophers, 2023). Adkins et al. (2020) claim that after decades of asset appreciation and stagnant wages, asset ownership—rather than income from waged labor—now primarily stratifies society. The authors have stressed that the asset economy is driven by the middle class through house ownership and prices. Against this, I make the case to focus on the $1\\%$ to examine how inequality is constructed from the top. This paper shows that asset dynamics as structuring forces of society are initiated, perpetuated, and amplified by VC investing. Protagonists of VC's rise actively engineered their exposure to asset dynamics and appreciation.  \n\nHowever, innovations that VCs pioneered toward this aim needed decades to take hold and unleash their full effect. Conceptually, the central insight here is that VCs solution for a personal problem of abundance unintendedly served as a map for the large-scale handling of the more recent macro problem of abundance. I show that early VC investors incrementally built a financial infrastructure through legal and organizational innovations that catered toward their personal enrichment and that of their allies. VCs increasingly exercised considerable influence as their funders (institutional investors like pension funds, insurances, and endowments) and investees (startups) started to engage with this infrastructure and oriented their actions toward its imperatives—what I term the emergence of an alliance of asset owners. The paper argues that we should read this influence much more explicitly as conditioned on elite surplus and access to this financial infrastructure.  \n\nThis paper synthesizes conceptual and historical scholarship to demonstrate the centrality of abundance for VC's role in the making of financialization. I draw on two data sources: secondary literature on the genesis of venture capitalism in the US, and primary interview data with early venture capital investors from the Bancroft Library Oral History Archive. Not having been involved in the interview process, I tread carefully with the interview data and only present it in conjunction with other sources for contextualization. I employ a radical historicist method (Knafo, 2017) to analyze this data and build a narrative attuned to agents' innovations, separate intentions from outcomes in social struggles, and tease out what difference VCs made for the broader process of financialization.  \n\nFor this historicist reconceptualization, I review the literature on venture capital's role in deepening inequalities through innovation and financialization. I find that framing VC investing as speculative excess risks underestimates the political stakes of the changes VCs affected, highlighting the need to acknowledge venture capitalists’ agency in the co-production of structures. I use the concept of financial infrastructure to undermine structuralist analysis and account for the scaling of VCs' localized solutions to macro importance. In the main empirical section, I offer a different reading of existing histories of VC through the lens of abundance and asset appreciation. I trace VC's rise by focusing on its 1950s emergence, 1960s formalization, and 1970s institutionalization of venture capital. In the following discussion, I reflect on developments since the 1980s to tease out how wealth inequality and privilege were a key factor in the emergence of VC and how it ties in with scholarship on asset ownership and appreciation as a new stratifying force in society.  \n\n## Venture capital and inequality in financialized times  \n\nScholars in political economy, economic sociology, and management studies have linked VC and inequality across multiple domains. These literatures intersect in the process of financialization, where VCs have been researched as speculative financiers, drivers of innovation and macro-level inequality, and of the financialization of the firm.  \n\nThe literature highlighting VC's speculative quality situates VC investing in the macro context of a financialized world that offers fewer and fewer opportunities for profitable investments in the ‘real economy. Typically following Brenner's (2006) Long Downturn, the argument goes that declining rates of profitability in the manufacturing sector led to a reallocation of capital into speculative financial investments to make profits, driving finance's expansion. This expansion of finance has been criticized as undermining sound economic growth by diverting capital away from productive, and toward speculative, uses’ (summarized by Beck & Knafo, 2019; see also Langley, 2021, p. 383). Srnicek (2016; see also Valliere & Peterson, 2004) argues along these lines when he observes that the boom in the 1990s ^was an era driven by financial speculation, which was in turn fostered by large amounts of venture capital (VC) and expressed in high levels of stock valuation. As US manufacturing began to stall after the reversal of the Plaza Accord, the telecommunications sector became the favored outlet of financial capital in the late $1990s^{\\prime}$ (P. 20). Beyond the Dotcom boom, scholars have more recently focused on the Big Tech boom during the 2010s. Kenney and Zysman (2019) observe that the vast increase in VC money used to fund startups has led to a situation where these companies can operate at a loss for extended amounts of time. This misallocation of capital, they argue, leads to disruption without generating profit' and is destroying economic value′ (Kenney & Zysman, 2019, p. 39; also see Elder-Vass, 2021). VC is part of the broader trend of financialization and hence contributes to the deepening inequalities through the inflation of the financial sector at the expense of the 'real economy.  \n\nA separate strand of research recognizes the importance of VCs in fostering innovation in growth-centered political economies (Schumpeter, 2005; Schwartz, 2016b), yet remains attuned to their role in the reproduction of broader inequalities (Lazonick & Mazzucato, 2013). Most prominently, the National System of Innovation approach analyzes the importance of an eclectic range of actors in innovation processes (Freeman, 1995). Kenney (2011) argues that VC managed to stabilize its position within the US National System of Innovation through strong performance and financial returns as a proof of concept, setting off a dynamic where strength begot strength. The National Venture Capital Association, VCs' lobbying body, promoted these successes in Washington, DC, further strengthening VC's position. Deepening Kenney's account, Rothstein (2022) provides a detailed explanation of how the formation, rise, and endurance of social blocs enabled VC's rise and their disproportionate influence. Using the concept of the ‘tech-VC bloc, he argues that venture capitalists credibly sold an innovation-led growth model to legislators. VC here becomes an endogenous factor in the now wider-spread innovation-focused policy paradigms, tying themselves to the success of these political proposals.  \n\nThe tech-VC bloc advocated for a model that materialized as the new economy business model (Lazonick, 2013) in the 1990s. This model became prevalent in the US high-tech sector and comprises high growth, inter-firm labor mobility and lends itself to the imperatives of the shareholder value revolution in increasingly financialized capitalism. However, despite its wide-spread embrace in policy circles, there is reason to doubt that innovation-led growth is a tide that lifts all boats equally. Lazonick and Mazzucato (2013) argue that there has been an increasing separation between those economic actors who take the risks of investing in innovation and those who reap the rewards from innovation’ (Lazonick & Mazzucato, 2013, p. 1094)—a shift in the risk-reward nexus. The authors outline how VC is often mistaken as a glowing example of risk taking, where in fact other actors in the National System of Innovation were a necessary condition for their startup investments and reaping benefits of pre-existing research—VCs come in late in the innovation process.  \n\nLike Lazonick and Mazzucato,Schwartz (2016b,2019） is concerned with innovation and inequality in financialized capitalism. However, he develops his analysis by focusing on inequality at the firm level. Schwartz investigates the relationship between an overall, macro slowdown in economic growth (secular stagnation) and rising inequality due to firm-level changes in strategy and structure. Firms’ strategies increasingly depend on intellectual property rights (IPRs) to ‘éxtract monopoly rents from other firms and consumers’ (Schwartz, 2016b, p. 228), exacerbating inter-firm inequality. Firms structures have changed with the pressure to maximize shareholder value, shifting labor and physical assets outside the legal boundaries of the firm, producing individual-level inequality and weakening the rate of growth of consumption’ (Schwartz, 2016b, p. 228). Overall, inter-firm inequality suppresses investment and individual-level inequality suppresses demand, yielding a state of secular stagnation. IPRs are central to the operation of firms in the knowledge economy, and the monopoly rents they enable promise huge upsides for investors in the company. VCs operate here as investors in a capitalist contradiction, seeking returns in tech startups while furthering overall stagnation through the financialization of the firm. Cooiman (2024) has analyzed in more detail how VCs imprint their financial imperatives on startups (see also Shestakofsky, 2024).  \n\nIn sum, the existing literature has outlined how venture capital has been affected by different aspects of financialization, whether it is the decline of manufacturing and the rise of speculative finance or the congruence with imperatives of the shareholder value revolution and the financialization of the firm, and how this in turn deepened economic inequalities. This paper aims to refocus our understanding of VC and inequality toward elite actors and asset dynamics. To achieve this, we need three interventions in the literature: A stronger emphasis on venture capitalists’ role in co-producing financialization, and within this, an orientation away from the speculative framing of finance toward a conceptualization of how abundance accompanied this process.  \n\nFirst, political economy accounts of VC underplay the agency of financiers in co-producing structural shifts in the operation of finance. Scholars exogenize VC's business model and investors appear to be spurred by a lack of productive outlets for investment. The institutionalist literature reviewed above is more attuned to the organizational and legal innovations integral to this. However, while all accounts emphasize the importance of various actors and levels of analysis, entrepreneurial clusters, and the state receive the most attention. These contributions are less attuned to specific actors within this emerging type of investing that made a difference in its present-day operation. We lose sight of the wealth inequality that was baked into VC investing from the very beginning.  \n\nSecond, accounts centering on speculation misread the political stakes of capital abundance and VC's involvement with it. This critique of finance holds onto the idea of a real economy vs. a speculative one and reduces its potency to a moralizing critique of financiers. Implicitly, our understanding of VC's involvement in inequality comes out of the typical focal points of the financialization literature (like the neoliberal turn in the 1970s) and centers on exuberant market transactions of investors, making this a problem of regulation or even psychology. This forgoes the option to trace problematic developments back even further and identify mechanisms that enabled them to persist.  \n\nThird, and closely related, scholars do mention abundance but do not make it a genuine concern in their analysis. Kenney and Zysman (2019) observe a ‘vast increase of VC money, with Schwartz's backdrop of secular stagnation commonly linked to concentrations of vast amounts of capital (Bernanke, 2015; Mian et al., 2020; Summers, 2016). Within the Long Downturn view, VCs have been analyzed as part of a system clogged with excess capacity and savings (Riley, 2023, para. 3). This is a missed opportunity because analyzing the handling of abundance enables us to plot a line from individual level concentrations of wealth toward their large-scale significance for inequality.  \n\nAgainst this, I first propose to put asset dynamics at the center of our understanding of inequality. In the Asset Economy literature, scholars have moved away from the productionist toward a post-foundational view of finance, trying to understand phenomena like speculation not as an aberration but as the very stuff of financial life (Adkins et al., 2020, p. 19). This paper focuses on VCs efforts to turn abundant cash into appreciating assets. This is not about one-off speculation but the construction of durable infrastructures for asset appreciation, which enrolled tech workers and institutional investors alike. The political implication is that this could not simply be scaled back, reversed, or reallocated to the ‘real economy (Dutta,2023).  \n\nSecond, I claim that the focus on the handling of abundance can reveal important mechanisms for asset-driven inequality that otherwise remain hidden. I contend that VC investing started as investment experiments of a monied elite in the 1950s. To demonstrate the importance of concentrations of capital, I trace how elite actors made innovations and navigated structural conditions to ensure the appreciation of their assets. The focus on the $1\\%$ should be insightful for understanding inequality. This does not mean we will lose sight of broader societal effects—what matters here is that a small group of financiers remade the world at large. In the next section, I will outline the conceptual framework for tracing the origins of VC to its present-day influence.  \n\n### The construction of financial infrastructures  \n\nThis article traces the VC-led making of the alliance of asset owners, a group of actors in possession of abundant funds who were actively invested in constructing the legal and organizational, and beyond that, the economic and technological environment for the appreciation of their assets. Conceptually, we are looking at the making of a financial infrastructure, a process that is always a co-production of agency and structures, of VCs making their own history but not under circumstances of their own choosing. A key claim of this paper is that small VC-led innovations unintendedly served as a ready-made solution for institutional investors much later on. The concept of financial infrastructures offers us analytical purchase in three ways: First, it helps to work against dichotomies and highlight co-constitution of agency and structures. Second, by emphasizing that this construction is a socio-technical process, we can get a more detailed account of what exactly constitutes structures without having to fall back on generalizing terms. Third, infrastructure helps us account for how small solutions scaled (often in bursts) to affect the macro level economy.  \n\nKeeping with the intention to safeguard against privileging structures in the explanation (Beck & Knafo, 2019; Knafo & Dutta, 2020), I contend that an infrastructural approach lends itself to highlight agency. Importantly, our conception of agency needs to go beyond highlighting actors’ actions in one-off situations like a successful lobbying attempt or a single innovation. Instead, the interaction between agents and the infrastructures they are building must highlight agents’ continuous engagement. Pinzur (2021), while not concerned with VC specifically, gives a fine-grained account of how actors’ contributions create and shape financial infrastructures. He circumvents the usual elaboration of how structural and instrumental power approaches open a gap for infrastructural power by contrasting social structural and infrastructural power. Elites wield social structural power by utilizing their ‘political and economic power to ensure infrastructural advantages, exemplified in the ability of financial firms and lobbyists to mold market infrastructures' (Pinzur, 2021, p. 647). This shaping from without contrasts with Pinzur's understanding of infrastructural power as a way of shaping from within: To examine infrastructural power means to pay attention to what contributions actors make to the operation of infrastructure, and what discretion they exercise over it. This is the conception of agency I will employ in this paper.  \n\nScholars have further deployed the concept of infrastructure to incorporate different degrees of materiality. On the ‘most material end of the spectrum, infrastructure can be understood as facilitating the movement of physical things. On the conceptual end, infrastructure might be understood as a heuristic device’ (Bernards & Campbell-Verduyn, 2019) that draws together key functions. Scholars draw on infrastructures when trying to explain the socio-technical production of outcomes. This might involve financial analysts and trading terminals or high frequency traders and microwave towers (Beunza et al., 2006; MacKenzie, 2018; Petry, 2021). In the case of the financial infrastructure of the alliance of asset owners, socio-technical analysis allows us to highlight the importance of the law. In the way that Pistor (2013) discusses the extension of legal infrastructure′ (p. 318) that made the global derivatives market possible, this paper specifically examines the legal arrangement of the limited partnership as integral for scaling VC's influence. Soener and Nau (2019) have discussed the importance of the limited partnership as an organizational structure for elite power more generally, while Nicholas (2019, chapter 5) has discussed its importance specifically for VC (also see Kenney, 2011). Its construction engendered new relative dependencies on processes and dynamics of asset appreciation.  \n\nLastly, the concept of infrastructure has been used to show how the agency of financiers  has  often unintentionally affected  large-scale  change.  Walter and Wansleben (2020), for instance, trace the construction of central bank infrastructural power through processes of formalization. Inherent in tracing the process of formalization is a concern with how innovations, small scale changes became routinized, written into policy or law, and thereby scaled to exert much more influence and structure behavior at a larger scale. They seek to demonstrate that innovations in finance [...] became successfully enlisted as constitutive features in a new macroeconomic governance regime’ (Walter & Wansleben, 2020, p. 626). This is similar to institutions-focused accounts of financialization. Carruthers (2015) sees financialization as a result of the ongoing capitalist drive to preserve the underlying institutionalist preconditions of capitalist markets: property rights, information, regulation, and failure. He makes a crucial point about unintended consequences, stating that ‘[m]any of these changes started as local solutions to specific problems, but unintentionally engendered complexity and path dependency’ (Carruthers, 2015, p. 393). Streeck and Thelen (2005) have called this ‘incremental change with transformative results' (p. 9). While there is an emphasis on incremental change or even a ‘stalactite model of change’ (Djelic & Quack, 2003, p. 309) in some of the institution building accounts, what this paper shows is that some incremental changes led to explosive growth altering entire industries. The infrastructure concept has an edge over institution building approaches because it puts stronger emphasis on the scalability of localized solutions, tracing how something becomes routinized and deployed at scale, often rapidly.  \n\nThe notion of financial infrastructure should ultimately serve us to make claims about the power relations at play. My conception of VC infrastructural power is that these actors had considerable discretion over building and bending the limited partnership for personal enrichment. With regard to startup employees and institutional investors, VCs were also able to govern their allies by enrolling them into the routines and interests associated with limited partnership investing, namely fast asset appreciation. However, in the history, this paper is concerned with, the effects of making people dependent on and engaged with the new financial infrastructure become more indeterminate over time. VCs held infrastructural power in the sense that they made substantial contributions to the operation and scaling of the infrastructure, but with scale lost discretion to exercise power over it. The early days of venture capital are the ideal starting point to trace how this story unfolded.  \n\n### 1950s: finding an outlet for excess cash  \n\nToday's VCs pride themselves on their mission to disrupt legacy industries and to challenge the status quo. However, if we go back to the beginnings of modern VC investing, we find that pioneers were the heiresses and heirs of steel, oil, railroad, and real estate empires. The Rockefellers, Carnegies, Phipps, and Whitneys ran family offices for their investment activities and made informal venture investments based on personal connections (Johnson, 2008, p. 22). American Research and Development, an investment company commonly cited as the first VC firm, was managed by George Doriot, a former military general with excellent links to Harvard and the East Coast establishment. Nicholas (2019) highlights that a direct lineage from the early entities based on family wealth to various modern VC firms' (p. 5) can be traced, underlining their defining and enduring influence.  \n\nVC's organizational form developed as this type of investing spread from the East Coast to the West Coast. The first venture capital firm on the West Coast, Draper, Gaither, and Anderson (DGA), was founded in 1959 by two military generals and the former chair of RAND and the Ford Foundation. As Kenney (2011) points out, ‘the first three [partners of DGA] were members of the highest levels of the U.s. business and policy elite' (p. 1698). Elite connections were essential for raising capital for the fund. DGA raised US $\\$2.4$ million from two family offices (Rockefeller and Heller), US $\\$1.5$ million from the investment firm Lazard Freres, andUs $\\$1.2$ million from the Gadran Corporation (Berlin, 2014, p. 160; Nicholas, 2019, p. 156). The overall fund size was US $\\$6$ million. As one early VC observed, [hJowever much money [General Anderson] wanted just flowed in from these East Coast people (Lucas, 2009, p. 10). Hence, Berlin (2014) concludes that DGA “must be understood as seeding the modern venture capital industry not by radically departing from prevailing East Coast models of power, capital, and influence, but instead by importing and modifying those models for a West Coast environment that had not yet established its own institutions' (p. 156).  \n\nHowever, the fact that the West Coast had not yet established its own institutions does not mean that there was no risk of capital investing before DGA's arrival. Since the mid-1950s, a largely informal VC investing community had formed in the San Francisco Bay Area which became known as the Group' (Nicholas, 2019, p. 208). In today's terminology, these people would be considered angel investors'—high-net-worth individuals providing financial backing for very early-stage companies in exchange for equity. These investments happened largely outside formal investment structures or firms. Among ‘the Group' were, most notably, Reid Dennis and Pitch Johnson, who later became presidents of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). Johnson further details that this informal group consisted of 12 people who met for monthly dinners (Johnson, 2008, p. 21). In this context, he recounts a particularly insightful anecdote from the early days of venture investing:  \n\nOne thing we did that was almost amusing—there were two streets in Palo Alto called Commercial and Industrial. Entrepreneurs were beginning to start companies on their own, and so we used to go down Commercial. We did one time, literally, go down there in our car and walk along, knock on the doors and say, Want any money today? kind of thing. (Johnson,2008,p.23)  \n\nOn the one hand, this illustrates the informality, local connections, and low competitiveness with which deals were made at the time. On the other, it highlights that investors were in search of profitable outlets for their capital, in fact, any outlet. VC was a financing model in search of an application. In orthodox accounts, VCs are said to solve a simple problem of the market economy: How to connect people with good business ideas but no money to investors with money in search of ideas (Kaplan & Lerner, 2010). In this view, VC is a textbook example of the capital allocation problem which explains the existence of this type of financial intermediary. Yet historically, capital scarcity is the opposite of what actors were dealing with in the early days of venture capital. We can see a consistent theme of elites and wealthy individuals looking to deploy excess cash.  \n\n### The emerging alliance of asset owners  \n\nWhile finding an outlet for excess cash is the necessary first step, the second concerns the modalities of securing investment returns. Notably, in the above examples, capital was not distributed as credit (with the expectation to have it repaid with interest) but in exchange for equity. Any hope of multiplying invested money rested on an increase in the value of said equity. The second VC fund on the West Coast, Davis & Rock, showcases how old’ East Coast money was soon met by newly rich startup employees as a driving force for the establishment of VC and an alliance of asset owners. The key link between these two actors is rapid equity (asset) valuation increases through the intense work culture in startups.  \n\nA prime example of this is the engineers of Fairchild Semiconductor. Before joining Fairchild Semiconductor, this group worked at Shockley Semiconductor where they attempted to replace germanium with silicon as the primary material for transistor construction (Miller, 2022). Known as the ‘traitorous eight, they collectively abandoned Shockley to start a new business:  \n\nWhen the eight engineers left Shockley Semiconductor, one of them, Eugene Kleiner, used his family connections to contact Hayden Stone, the East Coast investment bank. The business proposal was forwarded to Arthur Rock, at the time a Hayden Stone investment banker in New York. Rock and his immediate superior visited the start-up and agreed to raise $\\$1.5$ million. [...] Rock then approached Sherman Fairchild, the owner of Fairchild Camera, who agreed to invest $\\$1.5$ million with the proviso that Fairchild be allowed to purchase the shares of the eight founders for $\\$300,000$ apiece should the venture prove successful. Within three years, Fairchild bought the founders’ shares, and the founders no longer had any equity in the firm. As is well known, almost immediately engineers began to leave Fairchild to launch new firms. (Kenney & Florida, 2000, p.107)  \n\nThere are two important elements in this brief history. After leaving Fairchild, these engineers not only launched new firms but also financed Arthur Rock's first limited partnership, Davis & Rock. This exemplifies the increasingly close bonds between financiers and entrepreneurs that came to define Silicon Valley's rise (Kenney & Florida, 2000, p. 108). It also marks the starting point of an alliance between two groups of actors with a keen interest in asset appreciation. As I will show below, this thread will run through the following two decades and prompt various legal and financial innovations.  \n\nEven more importantly, Fairchild is an early example of how remuneration and ownership mattered for the development of the VC industry and Silicon Valley more broadly. Key employees became part owners of the firm, although their shares could be purchased from the Fairchild owner at a previously agreed price. This setup indicates that income from wage labor was set to be outpaced by potential income from asset ownership of shares in fast-growing tech companies. However, the fact that all engineers left right after being forced to sell their shares shows that this arrangement did not cater to the central importance of sustained asset appreciation for employees. If entrepreneurs or managers did not get shares of the company that enabled them to benefit financially from the firm's performance, they simply left. Neither on the investor nor on the entrepreneurial side a functioning ownership structure had developed yet.  \n\nIn response to this, legal and financial innovation was borne directly out of the Fairchild case. Lécuyer (2005) argues that former Fairchild Semiconductor engineers started new firms as vectors for personal enrichment and technological innovation' (p. 294). Two of these engineers, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, went on to found Intel and worked with a Silicon Valley law firm to devise a stock ownership plan which enabled employees to hold onto their stock (Kenney & Florida, 2000, p. 110). This proved widely influential and became a model for VC-backed startups in the following decades. Kenney (2011) emphasizes the importance of this as stock options aligned employee interests with that of the entrepreneurs and venture capitalists—namely generating capital gains. The prospects of a large pay-off at a liquidity event attracted many of the very best engineers and executives and motivated them to work incredibly long hours' (p. 1691).  \n\nDGA and Davis & Rock presented the first serious steps into the formalization of an up to this point largely informal investment style. Capital pushing into early-stage  companies  showcased  opportunities  for  asset-based  enrichment  and actors embarked on experimentation to formalize mechanisms to secure these gains. This was a trial-and-error process-the transition between informal and formal investing required problem-solving on various fronts.  \n\n### 1960s: organizational experiments  \n\nThe two main drivers of the formalization of VC investing were the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program and the introduction of the limited partnership as the organizational form for VC. Coincidentally, the first limited partnerships DGA and Davis & Rock, and the SBIC program were both launched in 1958. Analytically, this offers an opportunity to highlight how agency mattered for the eventual large-scale adoption of the limited partnership in venture capital investing. In the late 1950s, the US government made increased efforts to support small businesses. Policy makers at the time sought to close a funding gap for entrepreneurial finance which was estimated to be $\\operatorname{USS}500$ million (Nicholas, 2019, p. 134). Cold War antics, particularly the Sputnik crisis of 1957, instilled an urgency to make funding for new technology companies available. This was further amplified by an influential study by the Federal Reserve Board, which put particular emphasis on the importance of making capital available for newly established businesses (Kenney, 201l, p. 1692). This assessment culminated in the launch of the SBIC program in 1958. For the following decade, this program was an indirect way for the US government to fund innovation and technology development. Instead of giving grants or loans directly to companies, the SBIC acted as a financial intermediary which received government loans.1  \n\nTo start a SBIC, a private investor acting as prospective SBIC operator had to pay in at least US $\\$150,000$ . This paid-in capital could receive a $200\\%$ leverage in the form of government loans at favorable interest rates, for a total volume of US $\\$450,000$ . The possible leverage decreased gradually for starting capital under US $\\$150,000$ . which disincentivized investors to form larger SBICs. Furthermore, legislators sought to protect investee companies from takeovers by capping the amount of equity that could be purchased through an SBIC at $20\\%$ . This meant that investors could not take controlling stakes in companies (Kenney, 2011, p. 1693). The literature is not clear on how SBIC operators earned an income while waiting for their investments to deliver returns. It can be assumed that due to their small size, administration costs were relatively low and that investors lived off returns from previous or concurrent investments. This suggests that operating an SBIC was only possible for individuals with substantial savings or wealth. Investors would eventually receive a return on their investment when the investee company was acquired or went public on the stock market.  \n\nLimited partnerships, on the other hand, existed long before VC (Nicholas, 2019, p. 145). The first VCs to make use of them, DGA and Davis & Rock, retained their basic features. VCs act as general partners in the partnership and fundraise from investors who become limited partners with their investment. General partners are expected to contribute their private money to the fund, which originally served to demonstrate that they also have skin in the game. At DGA, for instance, the principals invested US $\\$600,000$ of their own savings (Kenney, 2011, p. 1699). Additionally, limited partners are paying a $2{-}3\\%$ management fe for their investment in the VC fund. With this money, the VC firm finances its operations and pays investors′ salaries. The most decisive difference compared to earlier organizational forms for VC investing came in the form of remuneration and profit sharing. DGA reset the rules for how profits were shared upon the fund's liquidation. General partners of the fund retained $40\\%$ of profits, whereas limited partners received $60\\%$ . Davis & Rock operated on a similar framework where profits were shared according to the $80/20$ rule: $80\\%$ of profits went to limited partners and general partners received $20\\%$ . This distribution eventually became the industry standard (Berlin, 2014, p. 159; Kenney, 2000, p. 102). The pay of general partners was now tied to fund performance.  \n\n### Limited partnerships and the route to formalization  \n\nBoth SBICs and the limited partnership largely replaced the informal forms of venture investing. The SBIC program was initially successful, and, as Kenney (2011) observes, due to the rapid success of SBICs investing in electronics, it appeared that the SBIC Program was going to become an important factor in the VC industry’ (p. 1694). However, the limited partnership eventually became the dominant organizational form for VC investing. What explains this outcome?  \n\nFirst, there were several structural advantages of the limited partnership inherent to its organizational form. SBICs were legally restricted from owning more than $20\\%$ of equity in a firm. As a debt-fueled vehicle with government-guaranteed loans, investments were subjected to stringent rules. The $20\\%$ limit made it impossible to do follow-up investments in promising firms, an otherwise lucrative tactic to increase potential future payoffs. This is because in a high-risk investment environment in which most companies fail, increasing ownership in the few that are going well can translate into large returns. In a limited partnership, no such requirements limited investment tactics. General partners fundraised for equity investments in their fund, and limited partners did not get involved with the day-to-day investing of the fund. This gave VCs investing out of limited partnerships more room to innovate investment strategies.  \n\nSecond, an even greater limiting factor was that a capitalization of US $\\$450,000$ maximized leverage. Investments in startups are highly risky, and a certain number of investments in different companies are needed to ensure an adequate probability of success. At this level of capitalization, SBICs were effectively too small to make a sufficient number of investments for risk diversification (Kenney, 2011, p. 1693). By contrast, the limited partnerships DGA and Davis & Rock raised US $\\$6$ million andUs $\\$5$ million respectively. This allowed them to pursue a portfolio approach to investing where losses can be offset by outsized gains from a small number of investments. Whereas informal investing appeared to be based on oversupply on the investor side, this indicates that the formalization of VC made a baseline quantity of capital necessary for profitable investing.  \n\nFinally, the limited amount of capital that SBICs could effectively absorb (a capped leverage disincentivized investments larger than US $\\$150,000$ made them unattractive to institutional investors. As I will show below, the moment institutional investors accepted VC limited partnerships as a viable asset class proved pivotal for the rise of VC. This raises an important point about capital and scale: The viability and sustainability of solutions sometimes depend on their capital intensity. In important ways, SBICs were unable to cater to the next financial order of magnitude.  \n\nBesides these ‘pulling’ structural features of the limited partnership, there undoubtedly was an agential ‘push’ that sought to accelerate the SBIC program's demise. More precisely, it came under attack for limiting venture capital investing ‘proper? Surprisingly though, this charge was not led by VCs but by an institutional investor: the Ford Foundation. Under the leadership of Roger Kennedy, the Ford Foundation funded business associations which represented the interests of venture capitalists and sought to facilitate its expansion. In 1967, Small Business and Venture Capital  Associates published the report  Encouraging Venture  Capital for Small Business. This report characterized the SBIC program as ‘marred by incompetence' and that éexcessive federal regulation was primarily responsible for this (Kenney, 2011, p. 1696). It concluded by recommending the termination of the SBIC program. Kenney argues that despite ongoing federal support for the program, the report drove venture capitalists to abandon the SBIC program (ibid.).  \n\nThe problems outlined above meant than some of the most successful SBICs decided to pay off the government and further pursued their investments through limited partnerships. A SBIC Pitch Johnson (a former member of ‘the Group') started with Bill Draper in 1962 was converted into a limited partnership, Sutter Hill (Johnson, 2008, p. 27). While DGA itself performed rather poorly (Berlin, 2014, p. 163), several funds adopted this structure and started to attract more and more funding from limited partners. Among these funds, besides Davis & Rock, were later household names like Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, and the Mayfield Fund (Draper, 2008; Kenney, 2000, p. 109). As the limited partnership grew in numbers and importance throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, the structures that were tentatively built by an elite seeking to do venture investing were gradually stabilized and scaled by actors with significantly larger pools of cash to deploy. Nicholas (2019) calls limited partnerships a ‘conduit for wealthy investors’ (p. 147) to make risky investments.  \n\nIn sum, we have traced a direct line from the elite beginnings of VC into its formalization, and how this hinged on and further entrenched their privileged position (e.g. sizeable personal investments required as general partners, and the generous participation in profits through the 80/20 rule). We can see how the ability to deal with abundant capital begins to matter for the development of financial infrastructure, as SBICs proved too limiting for VC investing. We can further see how institutional investors are increasingly keen to join the alliance of asset owners, wanting to put more money into limited partnerships. As I show in the following section, this became more and more important as fund sizes started to increase: The pioneering work of the small-scale cash-rich prepared the investment ground for the large-scale cash-rich.  \n\n### 1970s: scaling the financial infrastructure  \n\nHandling abundance meant channeling large accumulations of cash held by single entities (high net worth individuals, family offices, insurances, corporations) into quickly appreciating assets. Alongside the problems associated with formalizing an investment model, like balancing money inflows with limited investment outlets, these actors faced increasing pressure from the macroeconomic and institutional environment of the late 1960s and 1970s. One problem on the national level was that economic growth started to slow and the US government was looking for an adequate policy response. At the same time, price inflation caused asset deflation in the 1970s. As Adkins et al. (2020) explain,‘inflation seriously eroded the wealth of the top decile and centile of households-—those whose wealth was invested in financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, or Treasury bills and whose income derived primarily from interests, dividends, rents, and capital gains. Throughout the 1970s, wealth holders were at a loss to find safe avenues of investment that would protect their assets from depreciation (p. 35).  \n\nThis situation likewise affected institutional investors. Due to legal restrictions, institutional investors were mostly invested in bonds (with falling returns) and had difficulties investing in stocks or other equities. The major obstacle that deterred institutional investors from investing in a highly risky asset class like VC was the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) which tightened the rules for private pension fund investments. ERISA introduced the so-called “Prudent Man’ rule which required fiduciaries to diversify the investments of pension plans so as ‘to minimize the risk of large losses unless it is clearly prudent not to do so' (Klesch, 1977, p. 27). As a result, pension fund managers adopted more conservative investment strategies out of fear of being held liable.  \n\nVC and institutional investors shared the problem of asset deflation. However, a closer look at the manufacturing sector at the time reveals an interesting development. As Harris (2023) points out, ‘[b]etween 1979 and 1986, total manufacturing as a share of gross national product stayed nearly flat, but the sector's composition changed a lot. Computers and machinery, electronic and electric equipment, instruments, and aircraft increased their percentage share by double digits, while all other manufacturing categories declined’ (p. 406). Given these growth rates, returns from venture investing in high-growth tech startups potentially remained an island of asset appreciation within this deflationary sea. Investment in high-growth tech startups became a viable solution but faced the two obstacles: First, institutional investors needed to overcome legal barriers to invest money into funds that could make this type of investment. Second, early VCs and entrepreneurs were sensitive to rates of capital gains taxation, as these directly impacted their net earnings.  \n\n### ERISA easing and capital gains tax reduction  \n\nThe Ford Foundation's involvement noted earlier was the first clear sign that institutional investors were set to join the alliance of actors invested in tech asset appreciation. From the early 1970s, VCs made increased efforts to entice institutional investors to invest in their funds. When Don Valentine raised the US $\\$5$ million fund for Capital Management (later Sequoia) in 1972, they made the conscious decision to only take money from tax-exempt sources (Kenney, 2000, p. 113; Valentine, 2009, p. 55). Another outlier in terms of limited partner composition was the fund Reid Dennis raised for Institutional Venture Associates in 1974. Six insurance companies and the Ford Foundation contributed US $\\$19$ million, which constituted $45\\%$ of all venture capital funding raised that year (Dennis, 2009, p. 31). This foreshadowed how much of a difference capital from institutional investors could make for the financial clout of the VC industry.  \n\nHowever, this required overcoming contemporary rules and norms limiting the flow of institutional capital into VC. The politics and process of the ERISA clarification have been covered comprehensively, and scholarly accounts have focused on lobbying by the NVCA and lawmakers (Kenney, 201l, p. 1707; Nicholas, 2019, p. 173). Don Valentine credits the president of the Ford Foundation with a considerable impact on the easing of ERISA rules (Valentine, 2009, p. 23). It is difficult to imagine from today's perspective, what has been called the age of asset manager capitalism? (Braun, 2021), that in the 1970s Roger Kennedy had been on a years-long campaign to convince various government actors that investing in equity was prudent for institutional investors. Effectively, these lobbying activities meant that the earlier tendencies among wealthy private investors to invest in (privately held) stocks were now starting to make an impact on the level of government.  \n\nAt the same time, levels of capital gains taxation became a highly politicized question. In 1976, Jimmy Carter proposed to get rid of the distinction between the taxation of ordinary income and capital gains. At the top rate, this would have effectively doubled the  capital  gains tax to $70\\%$ . In response to this, resistance from various actors that staked their hopes on tech-driven asset appreciation started to form. The venture capital industry formalized its lobbying efforts by founding the NVCA, for which Reid Dennis and Pitch Johnson both acted as presidents (Dennis, 2009, p. 33). Dennis pinpoints Carter's proposal as the turning point for venture capitalists:  \n\n[I]t got them galvanized into action in a way that nobody else had ever been galvanized before, to get together and do something about this thing. If it hadn't been for Carter's statement that we should get rid of all of the distinction between ordinary income and capital gains, I think we would have drifted along, and they would have nickeled and dimed us to death by making small changes all along the line until the industry was wiped out. (Dennis,2009, p. 33)  \n\nThe concerted lobbying pushback proved so effective that it overshot its initial goal of halting an increase in capital gains taxation. With the Revenue Act of 1978, Carter proposed a highly diluted reform bill. Derided by critics as a ‘millionaires' relief bill, it lowered the long-term capital gains tax rate to $25\\%$ .TheWashington Post captured the general spirit of this change by observing that ‘the Ways and Means Committee last week gleefully refused even to disallow business deductions for more than 22 martinis (for one person) a day or yachts exceeding 35 feet in length' (Lardner, 1978). With the passing of the Revenue Act, investors and employees holding stocks in quickly growing companies would only be taxed $25\\%$ and therefore at a considerably lower rate than income tax.  \n\nAccording to Reid Dennis (2009), referring to the first and second capital gains tax reduction which followed in 1981, the lowering of the capital gains tax made starting companies much more lucrative: managers just came pouring out of big companies to start their own—there were more startups started in 1980 than I think almost any year in the history of the business until recently' (p. 35). The pull of lower taxation coincided with a push of institutional capital. In 1979, the US Department of Labor clarified and effectively eased the ERISA fiduciary responsibility guidelines. This decisively changed VC's capital supply and is often referred to as the opening of the floodgates for venture capital funding.  \n\n### 1980s and beyond: a small solution to abundance at large  \n\nThe previous sections traced the formalization and scaling of VC's financial infrastructure in tandem with a tightening alliance of asset owners. The limited partnership emerged as the most suitable organizational form for absorbing large amounts of capital. As this form was replicated and deployed at scale, the limited partnership hardened into a financial infrastructure for VC investing that remained central for the coming decades. Soener and Nau (2019, p. 407) revealed that between 1980 and 2010, the number of limited partnerships in the US more than doubled. Although a majority of these were not set up for the purposes of VC investing, this clearly underlines the durability (Abourahme & Jabary-Salamanca, 2016; Bernards & Campbell-Verduyn, 2019) and broader impact of limited partnerships as financial infrastructure. Limited partnerships were able to handle the influx of large amounts of capital and at the same time offered the legal conditions for the actors engaged with them to maximize their capital gains.  \n\nThe ERISA clarification opened new sources of funds for venture capitalists. The surging inflow of money put the limited partnership's capacity to absorb capital to the test. Gompers (1994) observes that the ‘change explicitly allowed fund managers to invest up to $10\\%$ of their capital in venture funds. Pension fund commitments to venture capital rose dramatically, increasing annual new contributions to venture capital funds from $\\$100$ to 200 [million] during the 1970s to in excess of $\\$4$ billion by the end of the $1980s^{\\prime}$ (p. 12). Further, Gompers et al. (1998, p. 165) show a drastic increase in net new commitments to independent venture capital partnerships, rising from US $\\$480$ million to US $\\$5.30$ billion in 1987.2 This is an astounding development. To put this into perspective, only a decade earlier Kleiner Perkins raised a US $\\$8$ million fund in 1972, the largest ever at this point in time, and failed to invest half of it.3  \n\nOn the back of this new financial infrastructure, fundamental change in the US economy ensued. As Gompers (1994) points out, “[p]rior to 1980, firms created the majority of new jobs in the American economy. During the last decade [the 1980s], however, a major structural shift occurred. Fortune 500 companies lost 4 million jobs. At the same time, firms with fewer than 100 employees added 16 million new jobs [...] This was the first time in the twentieth century that the shift from large to small firms occurred and it represented a fundamental change in the nature of growth in the American economy’ (p. 1, emphasis added). This observation ties in withRothstein's(2022) argument that VCscredibly soldadigital transformation-centered growth model. My point here is not that VCs funded all these small firms. Rather, there was a financial infrastructure in place to amplify this trend further and funnel money toward a rising number of newly incorporated companies who could trial new (feeble) business ideas for longer or even the first time at all.  \n\nThe structural change that VCs affected was that they now funded and sustained companies and business models that under different circumstances, in the absence of such a financial infrastructure, would have had no viability. This handling of abundance changed firm creation and the economics of entire sectors. As Reid Dennis (2009) observes, ‘in the huge bull market of venture capital and fundraising, pension funds have become a major source of capital, and it's one of the things that has flooded the industry with so much capital that it doesn't know what to do with it (p. 30, emphasis added). In the 1980s, Gompers (1994) describes how this situation, what I would term a ‘problem of abundance, informed the investment craze for hard disk companies: ‘the sudden and dramatic increase in venture capital commitments meant they had to find something in which to invest. The large fraction of inexperienced venture capitalists changed the rules of investing’ (p. 18). This ‘bull market could be read as the pro-cyclicality story of VC, investments rising with buoyant stock markets. However, this reading neglects the push from concentrated capital. The term ^solution, hence, must be taken with a grain of salt. As capitalist development often rests on contradictions, the erstwhile solution to the problem of abundance for VCs created new problems almost instantaneously.  \n\n### Abundance and asset-driven inequalities  \n\nA central claim of this paper is that VCs made important innovations that at the time solved their personal problems of abundance. By enrolling employees and institutional investors into their alliance of asset owners, these solutions changed how problems of abundance were solved not only on the personal but also the macro scale. The 2000s and 2010s were characterized by this type of abundance of capital. Particularly in reaction to the 2008 global financial crisis, major central banks pursued expansive monetary policy aiming to inject vast amounts of liquidity into the financial system. This policy coupled quantitative easing with ultra-low interest rates, ensuring cheap credit and driving down yields on bonds while raising yields on equities. Now institutional investors, unable to make returns on low yielding bonds, found themselves in a situation where they had capital that they didn't know what to do with.  \n\nPolicy makers? initial intention to spur liberal lending, and with that investment, growth, and employment, produced contentious outcomes. A central point of critique is that quantitative easing inflated the value of assets like equities and real estate while growth and employment remained anemic (Blyth, 2015). Recent scholarship has analyzed the effects of asset ownership, control, and appreciation for societal inequality (Adkins et al., 2020; Braun, 2016, 2021; Christophers, 2023). The macroeconomic regime is commonly understood to have empowered the owners of assets. The alliance of asset owners, and VCs chiefly among them, interacted with this condition of abundance in four key ways.  \n\nFirst, VCs did not bring this macroeconomic environment into being, but they pioneered a solution for handling abundant cash (and making it appreciate through tech asset investments) that was now used by investors on a much larger scale. VCs set up a financial infrastructure that funneled money into quickly appreciating tech assets. In 2008, US venture capitalists invested US $\\$29$ billion annually. By 2022, this number had increased more than 6-fold to US $\\$190$ billion (OECD, 2022). At this volume, especially given that this money is distributed to young companies, considerable parts of the contemporary economy depend on these abundant funds. This is either because of a highly risky business model that can only be financed by VCs or because businesses depend on investors’ money as life support until they reach profitability (Kenney & Zysman,2019).  \n\nSecond, channeling abundance this way creates a very particular financialization of the firm, of business models which can run on operations that would not work under normal conditions of capitalism. Many of these companies are not primarily profit-driven but growth-driven, as profits can remain elusive for a while on the back of the funding deluge. I discussed Schwartz's claim earlier that inter-firm inequality is worsened through IPR regimes and that individual level inequality is worsened by shifting labor and physical assets outside the legal boundary of the firm. Abundance furthers both: VCs decide which companies get a lifeline of funding to ‘disrupt their industries of choice until the economics eventually work out, clearly worsening inter-firm inequality. Beyond that, VCs also format the functioning of the firms they fund with the financial imperatives they impose (Shestakofsky, 2024). This influences individual level inequality through the terms of employment that firms offer, with gig workers as a stark example.  \n\nThird, VCs made a crucial contribution to elevating institutional investors (now looking to deploy their cash) to their structural importance in our current stage of capitalism. As demonstrated earlier, enrolling institutional investors into the alliance of asset owners opened up equity investments for the first time besides the then dominant investments in bonds. They made actors realize that they have a shared goal in asset appreciation and should orient their actions (e.g. lobbying) toward it with combined clout. Today, VCs are gatekeepers’ (Cooiman, 2024) of tech startup investments, and institutional investors are their suppliers of capital. Between 2012 and 2016, US venture capitalists distributed a total sum of US $\\$260$ billion (OECD, 2022). During this time span, private and public pensions funds constituted $38\\%$ of venture capital funds’ limited partner base, followed by foundations $(29.8\\%)$ and endowments $(21.2\\%)$ (Lenhard et al., 2023, p. 8). VC's disproportionate influence on shaping the economy hinges on institutional investors strong interest in allocating money into highly risky equity investments.  \n\nLastly, VCs constructed a financial infrastructure for their personal enrichment, which was supercharged by the generalized condition of abundance. As explained above, in VC limited partnerships the annual $2{-}3\\%$ management fee of total fund volume flows toward the VC firm irrespective of performance. In times when leading VC firms raise fund volumes in the billions of US dollars, this is a considerable sum. Growing the total paid-in capital hence raises the revenue of the VC firm. Braun (2022, p. 643) contends that asset managers drive a similar strategy of maximizing their fee revenue by growing their assets under management. In this case, even before asset appreciation, increased volume simply drives the opportunity for personal enrichment based on salaries.  \n\nHowever, this does not eclipse asset appreciation as the major driver of the inequal distribution of gains. Highlighting the role of VCs in making asset appreciation pay off for these groups of people reveals the political stakes: A small elite group of investors had a disproportionate influence on who gets to benefit from capital abundance. They pioneered a particular handling of abundance that furthered the reproduction of inequalities. This makes the asset economy a playing field for the extraordinarily wealthy.  \n\n### The solution to abundance and its problems  \n\nThe history presented above tied wealth inequality much more explicitly into the history of VC. I showed the lineage from wealthy elites with abundant funds at their disposal to modern day VC firms and their limited partnerships. With the example of Fairchild and stock options, limited partnerships winning over Small Business Investment Corporations, and the lobbying for the ERISA easing and lowering of capital gains tax, I highlighted the centrality of VCs in engineering asset appreciation. Elites are not only concerned with the reproduction of their own wealth but (at times inadvertently) reformat how entire sectors of the economy work. I used the concept of financial infrastructure to examine the legal constructs in the form of limited partnerships that enabled and scaled this financial restructuring. VCs enrolled other actors, limited partners, and employees, into an alliance of asset owners now bound together through this financial infrastructure. I showed the VC-fueled and institutional investor-funded disruption of existing industries and the rise of the gig economy as effects of this. They furthered the financialization of firms, allocating capital to far from ideal uses and obtaining a share of the gains incommensurate with the risk or labor invested. In sum, VCs deepened asset-driven inequalities by devising a particular handling of abundance, which materialized in building a financial infrastructure for their needs.  \n\nThe broader concern of this paper was VCs relationship with financialization and how a focus on abundance can clarify this relationship. It was the ambition of this paper to highlight the importance of this group of actors next to explanations of financialized capitalism that have focused on policy makers (Krippner, 2012), and structural transformations of capitalism (Brenner, 2006; Schwartz, 2016b). What would financialized tech capitalism look like today without VC? In addition to the established importance of VCs in lowering capital gains taxation, easing ERISA, and establishing stock options, this paper showed that more broadly, it is difficult to imagine that some of the reinforcing dynamics of the alliance of asset owners would have been possible without VC as a binding and driving force. Institutional investors looking for outlets for their capital in a low interest environment would not have been able to put that money into VC and by extension the digital economy. The fact that it is virtually impossible to scale a tech company without venture capital financing today, due to competitive pressures and the need for capital-intensive product and service development and expansion, suggests that the digital economy would have taken a fundamentally different shape.  \n\nWhile the 2010s were an era of abundant capital, the following decade saw a rise in interest rates that ended the free money’ bonanza for many investors. While funding levels have dropped, the financial infrastructure remains in place and has proven sturdy for financing the generative AI hype. More critically, the onset of a new macroeconomic regime invites us to take a closer look at how different types of asset owners work to maintain their access to the financial infrastructure built by VCs-and whether they can keep benefitting from it.  \n\n# Notes  \n\n1. There were three different types of SBICs: individually operated, public (i.e. raising money through public stock offerings), and SBICs formed by financial institutions. I will focus on individually operated SBICs, which were by far the most numerous (Kenney, 201l, p. 1693).   \n2. The capital gains tax reduction had the strongest effects on VC investors and employee stock owners. It did not substantially affect larger flows of capital into the VC industry as often  \n\nassumed because most investors in VC funds were tax-exempt anyways. Gompers (1994, p. 12) claims that up to $70\\%$ of funds came from tax-exempt sources like pension funds, endowments, trusts and foreign companies at the time (see also Poterba, 1989).  \n\n3.At least according to Tom Perkins himself (Perkins, 2009, p. 33). This seems plausible considering the lengths to which the general partners went to raise it (Nicholas, 2019, p. 212).  \n\n# Acknowledgments  \n\nI would like to thank Sahil Dutta, Will Davies, Ian Lovering, Annette Lareau, Kristin Surak, Chana Teeger, the Elites and Wealth Inequality Seminar group at the International Inequalities Institute, Paul Langley, Daniel Beunza, and three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.  \n\n# Disclosure statement  \n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).  \n\n# Funding  \n\nThis research was generously supported by the AHRC through a CHASE studentship  \n\n# Notes on contributor  \n\nNils Peters is a Fellow in Economic Sociology at the LSE.
