Using establishment-level data from the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Business Database for 1982-2015, this paper examines the impact of increases in concentrated institutional ownership on employment, wages, shareholder returns, and labor productivity. Consistent with theory of the firm based on conflicts of interests between shareholders and stakeholders, we find that establishments of firms that experience an increase in ownership by larger and more concentrated institutional shareholders have lower employment and wages. This result holds in both panel regressions with establishment fixed effects and a difference-in-differences  design that  exploits  large  increases  in  concentrated  institutional ownership, and is robust to controls for industry and local shocks. The result is more pronounced in industries where labor is relatively less unionized, in more monopsonistic local labor markets, and for dedicated and activist institutional shareholders. The labor losses are accompanied by higher shareholder returns but no improvements in labor productivity, suggesting that shareholder power mainly reallocates rents away from workers. Our results imply that the rise in concentrated institutional ownership could explain about a quarter of the secular decline in the aggregate labor share.  \n\nAntonio Falato   \nFederal Reserve Board   \nMail Stop #89   \n20th Street & Constitution Ave. NW   \nWashington, DC 20551   \nantonio.falato@ frb.gov Hyunseob Kim   \nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago 230 South LaSalle St.   \nChicago, IL 60604   \nUnited States   \nhyunseob.kim @ chi.frb.org   \nTill M. von Wachter   \nDepartment of Economics   \nUniversity of California, Los Angeles   \n8283 Bunche Hall   \nMC 147703   \nLos Angeles, CA 90095   \nand NBER   \ntvwachter@ econ.ucla.edu  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThe decline of labor, amid stagnant wages and falling employment, is a well-documented stylized fact of US labor markets over the last decades (see, e.g., Autor and Katz, 1999; Pierce and Schott, 2016; and Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen, 2020). At the same time, public corporations, which account for half of private employment in the US, underwent radical changes in their ownership structure with the rising importance of large institutional shareholders. Figure 1 shows how one common measure of concentrated ownership for US public firms, block institutional ownership (defined as more than $5\\%$ stock holdings), increased threefold from 1980 to 2014. By the end of the period, on average concentrated institutional shareholders held over $20\\%$ of the equity shares of US public corporations. In parallel, Figure 1 shows that the “labor share,” measured as the ratio between aggregate wages and salaries to domestic gross income in the US, exhibited a steady decline.  \n\nClassical theory of the firm based on agency conflicts between shareholders and workers suggests these concurrent trends may partly reflect a direct link between the ownership structure of public corporations and their employment decisions. In fact, prominent commentators in the popular press and CEOs of large corporations have recently expressed concerns that the so-called “shareholder capitalism” - i.e., the North American style of governance that since the 1980s has centered around the maximization of shareholder value as the main objective of the firm - may have hurt workers.2 Growing evidence on the impact of governance on employment (e.g., Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; and Davis et al., 2014) and on the effect of declining worker power on wages (e.g., Stansbury and Summers, 2020; and Farber et al., 2021) suggest that the impact of increases in shareholder power on labor could be substantial. Yet, even though concentrated institutional shareholders now control a large share of publicly traded firms, there is little systematic evidence on their impact on employment, wages, and firm outcomes.  \n\n![](images/780d6c029fde0294793b282424039f9556a58292c3a4223e4155d8feb9c62171.jpg)  \nFigure 1: Trends in Concentrated Institutional Ownership of Public Firms and Employee Compensation-to-GD1 Ratio in the US, 1980-2014. This figure plots the average block institutional ownership for public firms (blue solid line; left panel) and the ratio of total wage and salary accruals to domestic gross income (GD1) (red dotted line; right panel) in the US for the period 1980-2014. The red linear lines in both panels show linear time trends. Institutional ownership is from Thomson Reuter 13F filings data and the compensation-to-GDI ratio is from the Federal Reserve Economic Data. Block institutional ownership is the percentage owned by institutional blockholders, defined as the institutional investors with more than $5\\%$ holdings as filed through Form 13D, 13F, or 13G. The average block ownership is calculated excluding firms in the agriculture, financial, utilities, and public administration sectors.  \n\nTo study the role of increases in shareholder power, proxied by concentrated institutional ownership, this paper uses micro data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). Specifically, we assemble a rich establishment-level dataset that spans the 1982 to 2015 period and contains information on employment, payroll, and detailed ownership structure for over seven million establishment-year observations. Using this dataset, we document that increases in shareholder power, measured by ownership of large and concentrated  institutional  shareholders, are reliably associated with reductions  in establishments? employment and wages.  \n\nOur analysis is guided by the classical agency theory of the firm, which dates back to Jensen and Meckling (1976) (see Shleifer and Vishny, 1997; and Stein, 2003, for comprehensive reviews). In this class of theory, there is a fundamental conflict of interests over the allocation of firm resources between shareholders and stakeholders, including workers. Shareholders with large and concentrated ownership could hurt workers through two distinct but related channels. First, they have more bargaining power and can more easily renege ex post on implicit contracts not to fire workers or cut payroll via restructurings or hostile takeovers, as in the “breach of trust\"’ hypothesis of Shleifer and Summers (1988). Second, they can more easily monitor managers and force them to fire workers or cut payroll against their will, as per the “quiet life” hypothesis of Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003). In both cases, the presence of powerful shareholders hurts labor.  \n\nConsistent with this agency view of the firm, we find that an increase in shareholder power due to growing concentration among institutional shareholders is associated with reliably lower employment and wages within establishments (i.e., using establishment fixed effects). Importantly, we confirm the negative relation in a difference-in-differences design that exploits large changes in powerful institutional ownership to addresses selection issues. The relation is robust to several robustness checks, which include using multiple proxies for shareholder power, such as the percentage ownership of the largest one or five institutional shareholders, blockholders (defined as institutional shareholders with an at least $5\\%$ Stake), and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of institutional investors’ ownership. The robustness and specification checks also include controling for time-varying industry and local market conditions, limiting the sample to manufacturing, and using the symmetric growth rate of employment or payroll, wages per employee, and indicators for forced layoff announcement as the outcome variable. The relation is economically significant across the measures of shareholder power: a 10-percentage point increase in large shareholder ownership is associated with a 2.1 to $2.5\\%$ reduction in a given establishment's employment and payroll. It also holds up in the aggregate at the industry sector level.3  \n\nAfter establishing the negative relation between shareholder power and labor outcomes, we take a step toward clarifying the mechanism by determining which powerful institutional shareholders have the larger impact on labor and when. First, we explore variation in worker bargaining power and find that the employment and payroll losses are larger in industries where a smaller fraction of workers is unionized and in local labor markets where firms have more bargaining power vis- $\\grave{\\cdot}\\grave{\\mathrm{a}}$ -vis workers. Second, the labor losses are accompanied by higher shareholder returns but lower labor productivity within one year and no apparent improvements in productivity over longer two- or three-year horizons. The short-run loss of output and efficiency is hard to reconcile with a monitoring channel and rather, in line with a wealth transfer from workers to shareholders. Finally, we find that only institutional shareholders with control motives - i.e., “\"dedicated”\" institutions based on the classification of Bushee (1998) or “activist’ institutions - have a strong negative association with employment and payrol. Other types of shareholders without control motives, such as “quasi-index” and \"transient’ institutions, have a weaker and if anything, positive relation with employment and payroll. Anecdotal evidence from shareholder activism campaigns further points to the maximization of shareholder value as the stated goal to reduce labor-related expenses. Overall, the collection of evidence indicates that shareholder power has largely a reallocative impact, as labor cuts take value away from workers toward shareholders without increasing firm revenues.  \n\nOur paper makes several key contributions to the literature. Our paper provides the first causal evidence of the impacts of concentrated institutional ownership on employment and wages for the universe of institutional shareholders and publicly traded firms in the US. We thereby contribute to the growing literature on the impact of corporate governance and labor. This literature has shown that measures of managerial entrenchment, such as state-level anti-takeover statutes and dual-class shares, are associated with higher wages (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; and Cronqvist et al., 2009). Another strand of this literature examines the impact on labor and productivity of ownership by specific types of institutions, such as private equity (Lichtenberg and Siegel, 1990; and Davis et al., 2014) and activist hedge funds (Brav, Jiang, and Kim, 2015). Our evidence is important in light of the fact that, as we show below, concentrated ownership constitutes up to forty percent of the overall ownership by institutions. In turn, institutions own on average more than half of the shares of US public corporations, which constitute over half of aggregate GDP and employment in the US. Hence, the negative causal effects of concentrated institutional ownership on employment and wages we document affect a substantial number of establishments and employees.  \n\nAnother primary contribution is to assess the impact of the substantial growth of powerful institutional shareholders in the US over recent decades on the sluggish employment and earnings growth and declining labor share in the US. Our finding that the rise in concentrated stock ownership has helped to depress the labor share complements a number of important explanations set forth, including technology (Acemoglu, 2002), import penetration (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, 2013; Acemoglu, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, and Price, 2016; and Pierce and Schott, 2016), industry concentration and superstar firms (Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen, 2020), and labor market concentration (Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim, 2022). A related recent literature also examines the role of firms in wagesetting (see, for example, Card, Heining, and Kline, 2013; and Song, Price, Guvenen, Bloom, and von Wachter, 2019). Our results reinforce these findings by providing a novel rationale for the role of firms in employment and wage setting decisions.  \n\nBy showing that increases in concentrated ownership by institutional shareholders lead to a decrease in wages accompanied by an increase in shareholder value, our findings are also complementary to an ongoing literature documenting the relative decline in worker power and its impact on wages and employment. For example, Stansbury and Summers (2020) use aggregate industry-level data on union membership to argue that reduced worker power provides an explanation for rising firm valuations amid stagnant wage growth and declining labor share. Farber et al. (2021) use microdata on union membership dating back to 1936 to show that unions reduce wage inequality. By providing firm-level evidence that the rise of powerful institutional shareholders caused a redistribution of rents away from labor to capital Owners, we document another important factor behind declining worker power. Our finding that rising shareholder power has larger effects if union representation is weak highlights a novel and potentially important interplay between these two channels.  \n\nA final contribution is that we take a first step toward clarifying the broader consequences of rising shareholder power for the productivity and stock market valuations of US firms. By doing so, we join a recent literature that uses microdata to better understand the determinants of value added and the declining labor share (see, for example, Kehrig and Vincent, 2021), which had not yet examined the role of concentrated institutional shareholders. These results also contribute to the broader literature on the consequences of concentrated institutional shareholders for US firms. For example, Aghion, Van Reenen, and Zingales (2013) study the role of institutional shareholders in the governance of innovation. This literature has traditionally focused on the overall level of institutional ownership. Our contribution here is to highlight that, in addition to the overall level, the concentration of institutional ownership matters for US firms. Consistent with the previous literature, we find that overall institutional Ownership is positively correlated with productivity. We then show that at least in the shortrun the relation with ownership concentration is negative and discuss an agency rationale for it. Leveraging microdata to further explore the broader consequences of ownership concentration for US firms constitutes an interesting avenue for future research.  \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and variables used and provides descriptive statistics. Section 3 details the main empirical specification, our main establishment-level results, and covers several specification and robustness checks. Section 4 explores mechanisms underlying the main results. Section 5 examines the aggregate implications. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Data and descriptive statistics  \n\nThis section describes the datasets used in the empirical analysis, sample selection procedures, and resulting samples.  \n\n### 2.1. Data sources and sample construction  \n\nOur data source for establishment observations is the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) from the US Census Bureau. The LBD is a comprehensive dataset of establishments in the United States, covering all private business establishments with at least one employee Jarmin and Miranda, 2002; and Chow et al., 2021). The dataset provides annual establishmentlevel information on employment, payroll, industry classification, and geographic location (such as counties).4 We use the log of establishment-level employment and payroll as main outcome variables in our empirical analysis.  \n\nIn addition, we use a set of control variables standard among research analyzing establishment-level data employing Census micro datasets (see, for example, Schoar 2002; and Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim, 2022). Specifically, firm size is measured by the log number of establishments of a given firm, while firm-segment size is measured by the log number of establishments belonging to the firm in a given three-digit standard industry code (SIC) industry. Establishment age is defined as the number of years since an establishment's inception—identified by the flag for establishment's inception in the LBD—or its first appearance in the LBD, whichever is the earliest. The starting year is censored in 1977 when the coverage of the LBD begins.  \n\nThe institutional ownership data are from Thomson Reuters 13F SEC filings. All institutional investment managers  with greater than $\\$100$ million in  equity  assets under discretionary management are required to file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. All common stock holdings of 10,000 or more shares or having a value of $\\$200,000$ or more must be reported. Qualified securities include stocks listed for trading in the US. The quarterly holdings reported in the Form 13F represent the aggregate holdings of an institution (e.g., the Vanguard family of funds), rather than the holdings of any individual portfolio (e.g., the Contra fund in the Fidelity family of funds). Throughout the paper, an institutional investor (or shareholder) is defined as an institution that files a 13F.  \n\nThe main ownership variables of interest are defined as the holdings in a given firm's equity shares by a given type of institutional investors as a percentage of shares outstanding. Overall nstitutional ownersbip is the percentage owned by all institutional investors. Top 1 ownersbip and Top 5 ownersbip are the percentages owned by the largest one and five institutional investors, respectively. Total block ownersbip is the percentage owned by all blockholding institutions, which are defined as the institutional investors with more than $5\\%$ holdings as filed through Form 13D, 13F, or 13G. To better distinguish between ownership types among institutional shareholders, we also consider three additional variables: Quasi-index ownersbip, Dedicated ownersbip, and Transient ownersbip, which are the percentages owned by quasi-index, dedicated, and transient institutional investors as classified by Bushee (1998), all scaled by Overall institutional ownersbip. Activist ownersbip is the percentage owned by activist institutional investors as classified by Grennan (2019) based on institutional investors that have engaged in shareholder activism campaigns, scaled by Overall institutional ownersbip.  \n\nWe require that each establishment observation from the LBD have non-missing, positive values for employment and payroll, as well as the one-year lagged observation, which is used in part of our analysis that uses the growth rate of employment or payroll as an outcome. We then match establishments  with firm-level institutional ownership variables from Thomson Reuters as of the first quarter of the previous year using the Census Bureau's bridge file between the firm identifiers in the LBD and Compustat.5 We require that establishments have the matched institutional ownership variables. We exclude the agriculture (SIC 0100- 0900), utilities (SIC 4900-4999), financials (SIC 6000-6999), and public administration (SIC 9000-9999) industries from our sample. This sample selection procedure yields approximately 7,340,000 establishment-year observations from 1982-2015 (the Thomson Reuters data are available from 1980 but we require up to two-year lagged institutional ownership variables for part of the analysis). A subsample for the manufacturing sector (SIC 2000-3999), which is used in part of our analysis, includes approximately 533,000 establishment-year observations. The numbers of observations are rounded to follow the Census Bureau's disclosure rules.  \n\nWe construct data on collective bargaining coverage by following the approach in Hirsch and Macpherson (2003) and Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim (2022). Below we provide a brief description of the data source and construction, and refer to Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim (2022) for details. We compute the fraction of workers covered by labor unions at the industry level using the Current Population Survey (CPS) Outgoing Rotation Groups (ORG) data. The resulting data provide union coverage rate estimates, defined as the number of employees covered by labor unions divided by total employment, by Census Industry Code (CIC). Because our establishment-level data use SIC codes, we match the union coverage data with Census establishment-level data at the industry level using the Census Bureau's concordances between CIC codes and SIC codes. Given that our industry-level database on union coverage begins in 1983 whereas our sample period starts in 1982, we impute the rate of collective bargaining coverage using the 1983 information for years 1981 and 1982.  \n\nLastly, we compute the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of firm employment from the LBD at the three-digit SIC industry-by-commuting zone level as the measure of local labor market concentration (Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim, 2022). This variable is an (inverse) proxy for employees’ bargaining power relative to shareholders. In the analysis of the mechanisms below, we supplement the main data with additional sources that include information on firm revenues from the revenue-enhanced LBD (RE LBD) and Compustat. The firm-level revenue variables are available from 1997 in the RE LBD and throughout the sample period in Compustat.  \n\n### 2.2. Descriptive statistics  \n\nTable 1 shows descriptive statistics for institutional ownership and establishment characteristics for establishments in the full sample Panel A) and in the manufacturing sample (Panel B) from 1982-2015. Focusing on the full sample, the average overall institutional ownership, shown under “Main control variables,” is $59.7\\%$ 。consistent  with rising \"institutionalization” of public firm ownership in the past decades. Panel B shows similar mean values of institutional ownership variables for manufacturing establishments. The high level of ownership by institutions in the US motivates our focus on concentrated ownership by these institutions, as the rest of the shares are held by more diffused investors, such as retail investors and insiders who hold smaller individual stakes.7  \n\nTurning to our main explanatory variables, the average ownership by the largest five institutional investors or by blockholders, defined as institutional investors with at least $5\\%$ ownership, are $23.7\\%$ and $14.7\\%$ , respectively, and exhibit considerable variation with a standard deviation of $12\\%$ and $14.5\\%$ . As for the additional explanatory variables, ownership by “quasi-index”’ institutions are $58.5\\%$ of all institutional ownership, whereas ownership by \"dedicated” institutions, likely active monitors, accounts for $13.1\\%$ of all institutional ownership. These statistics suggest that, while the bulk of institutional shareholding is across less active owners, large and active institutions hold considerable ownership stakes in US public corporations.  \n\n# [Insert Table 1 here.]  \n\nThe average establishment in the full sample employs 62 workers and pays about $\\$2.5$ million with average annual pay of $\\$29,500$ per worker with a standard deviation of $\\$28,400$ all shown under “Main dependent variables.\" Manufacturing establishments exhibit larger employment and payroll per establishment on average (296 and $\\$13.7$ million), relative to those in the full sample, with average annual pay of $\\$42,700$ per worker. As for the main control variables, the average establishment's (public) parent firm owns more than 2,000 establishments, and the average age of establishments is 10.8 years.  \n\n## 3. Empirical analysis  \n\nThis section provides baseline estimates for the within-establishment relation between ownership by large institutional shareholders and employment or payroll, explores large increases in institutional ownership as a quasi-experiment, and examines robustness of the baseline results.  \n\n3.1. Baseline results - ownersbip by large institutional sharebolders, employment, and payroll  \n\nWe estimate the relation between ownership by large institutional shareholders, which presumably increases shareholder power, and establishment-level employment and payroll using the following equation:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{{\\bf y}_{i j k t}={\\alpha_{i}}+{\\alpha_{k t}}+{\\beta_{1}}L a r g e I n s t i t u t i o n a l O w n e r s h i p_{j t-1}}\\ &{\\qquad+{\\beta_{2}}O v e r a l l I n s t i t u t i o n a l O w n e r s h i p_{j t-1}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\gamma^{\\prime}X_{i t-1}+{\\varepsilon_{i j k t}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{i j k t}$ is the $\\mathrm{log}$ of either of total employment or payroll, $i$ indexes establishment, j firm, k industry, and $t$ year; $a_{i}$ represents establishment fixed effects; $a_{k,t}$ represents three-digit SIC industry-by-year fixed effects; $L$ arge institutional ownersbipjir $\\cdot\\boldsymbol{I}$ is a measure of large institutional shareholders′ ownership; Overall institutional ownersbip;i-1 is overall institutional ownership; $X_{i t-1}$ is a set of establishment-level control variables, including firm size and firm-segment size, and $\\varepsilon_{i j k f}$ is the residual. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level.  \n\nThe coefficient of interest is $\\beta_{\\uparrow}$ which represents the within-establishment semielasticity of employment or payroll to a measure of large institutional ownership, after controling for overall institutional ownership, establishment-level covariates, and timevarying industry conditions. We first employ ownership by top institutional investors as a measure of large shareholder ownership, and then employ total institutional blockholder ownership and concentration of ownership across institutions. The premise is that institutional investors would have strong incentives to maximize shareholder value, as well as power to do sO, potentially at the expense of employees, when they have large fractional ownership (Shleifer and Vishny, 1986) or when ownership is concentrated in the hands of few institutional investors. The control for overall institutional ownership helps address alternative interpretations due to omitted factors not related to institutions’ incentives to monitor managers or bargaining power relative to employees. If our main estimates were due to omitted factors that drive institutions’ decisions to buy or sell shares in a given firm for reasons unrelated to monitoring or bargaining power, then we would expect the Large institutional ownersbip variables to have no incremental explanatory power after controlling for Overall institutional ownership.s  \n\nTable 2, Panel A shows estimation results for Eq. (1) using the top one and five institutional ownership variables on the full industry sample. Columns 1 and 2 (columns 3 and 4) present the baseline within-establishment relation between ownership of the top institutional shareholders and log employment (payroll). The coefficient on Top 1 ownership in column 1 is -0.217 and significant at a less than $1\\%$ level. This estimate shows that for a given business establishment, a ten-percentage point increase in the largest institution's ownership (relative to the mean of $8.7\\%$ ) is associated with a $2.1\\%$ $(=\\exp(-0.217\\times0.1)-1)$ ) decline in employment,  controlling  for  time-varying  industry  conditions and  establishment characteristics. The coefficient in column 3 shows a similar magnitude of a withinestablishment decline in payroll (by $2\\%$ $t{\\mathrm{-stat}}=5.22\\$ in response to a ten-percentage point increase in the largest institution's ownership. These significantly negative relations are consistent with the idea that when the firm's largest institutional shareholder increases ownership and, thus, incentives to monitor or bargaining power, it reduces employment and payroll at its establishments in an attempt to maximize shareholder value.  \n\nSimilarly, columns 2 and 4 show that the collective ownership of top five institutional shareholders is negatively associated with establishment-level employment and payroll (significant at a less than $1\\%$ level). A ten-percentage point increase in top five ownership is associated with $2.3\\%$ and $2.5\\%$ declines in number of employees and wage bills, indicating a similar magnitude of the association with that for top one ownership.  \n\nAcross the columns, the coefficients on control variables have expected signs - the log number of establishments per firm, a measure of the owner firm's scope, is significantly positively correlated with both establishment-level employment and payroll. Importantly, the coefficient on Overall institutional ownersbip is positive and generally smaller in magnitude than that of our main variables of interest, Large institutional ownership. The positive relation between general institutional ownership and employment and payroll indicates that, unless they are powerful, the presence of institutional shareholders may not in and of itself hurt workers. This can be the case either because diffused institutional shareholders do not have the ability to influence firm decisions on labor or because their objectives differ from those of large institutional shareholders, as it may be the case for passive buy-and-hold institutions. We explore this possibility in more detail in Section 4 by analyzing the effects by institution type.  \n\n[Insert Table 2 here.]  \n\nPanel B presents estimates of Eq. (1) on a subsample of manufacturing establishments. Similar to the full sample results in Panel A, the coefficients on top one and five ownership variables are consistently negative and significant at a less than $1\\%$ level. The economic magnitude of the effect is somewhat larger in manufacturing than for all industries - for example, estimates in columns 2 and 4 indicate that a ten-percentage point increase in top five institutional ownership is associated with $2.9\\%$ and $3.2\\%$ reductions in employment and payroll within establishments. This larger magnitude decline in manufacturing employment and payroll is consistent with existing work documenting that the decline of labor over the past decades is most pronounced in manufacturing (e.g., Pierce and Schott, 2016; and Autor et al., 2020).  \n\nNext, we explore how powerful institutional shareholders affect establishment-level employment and payroll by estimating Eq. (1) using total institutional blockholder ownership and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of institutional investors? ownership as measures of shareholder power. Table 3 shows the estimation results.  \n\n[Insert Table 3 here.]  \n\nThe coefficients on Total block ownersbip in columns 1 and 3 in Panel A show that, when a given establishment experiences a ten-percentage point increase in block institutional ownership, its employment and payroll decline by $1.5\\%$ and $1.7\\%$ (significant at a less than $1\\%$ level). Similarly, the significantly negative coefficients on HHI institutional ownersbip in columns 2 and 4 show that when ownership becomes more concentrated among few institutions, the establishment experiences reductions in employment and wage bills. A one-standard deviation (SD) increase in the HHI (0.110) would lead to an about $1\\%$ reduction in establishment employment and payroll.  \n\nPanel B presents estimates for establishments in the manufacturing sector, showing similarly negative within-establishment relations between changes in block ownership or concentration of ownership and employment and payroll. The economic magnitude of the effect is more pronounced in manufacturing particularly when the HHI is employed to measure shareholder power - the coefficient on the HHI is $52\\%$ (employment) to $104\\%$ (payroll) larger in manufacturing relative to the full set of industries as shown in Panel A.  \n\n### 3.2. Robustness tests  \n\nThis section examines the robustness of the baseline results to alternative specifications and definitions of the institutional ownership measures.  \n\n#### 3.2.1. Local labor market conditions  \n\nA potential concern for our baseline results is that ownership of large institutional investors is correlated with local labor market conditions, which would affect labor market outcomes such as employment and wages. For example, a spurious correlation may arise if large institutional investors target firms operating in labor markets that are expected to become smaller, in which employment and wages tend to decrease (e.g., Moretti, 2011). To mitigate this type of concern, we re-estimate the baseline regression in Eq. (1) with county-by-year fixed effects, and present estimation results in Row A.1 of Table 4.  \n\n[Insert Table 4 here.]  \n\nAcross the columns, the row shows that the estimated association of top one, five, block, or concentrated institutional ownership with labor quantities is more pronounced once time-varying local labor market conditions are controlled for. For example, relative to the employment effect estimate in Table 2, Panel A, column 1 (-0.217), the coefficient on Top 1 ownersbip in Table 4, Row A.1, column 1 (-0.286) is about one-third larger. Similarly, the estimated semi-elasticity of payroll to top one ownership in column 5 is about one-third larger than the comparable estimate in Table 2, Panel A, column 3 (-0.274 vs. -0.205). These results suggest that omitted time-varying local market conditions are unlikely to explain the baseline findings. In addition, Row A.2 of Table 4 shows that the results are robust to controlling for alternative measures of local labor market conditions using industry-by-commuting zone-byyear fixed effects.  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Alternative measures of institutional ownership  \n\nWe also re-estimate the baseline regression in Eq. (1) using a moving average of institutional ownership, which includes two recent lags, to allow for a delayed response of employment and payroll to ownership. Estimates in Table 4, Row B show that the effect of powerful institutional ownership, measured using moving averages, is consistently negative and highly statistically significant largely at a less than $1\\%$ level). Interestingly, the economic magnitude of the effect is generally larger than those of the baseline results in Tables 2 and 3, indicating that further lagged changes in large institutional ownership have a greater effect on labor, relative to more recent changes. For example, the coefficient on Top 5 ownersbip in column 2 (-0.321) is almost $40\\%$ larger than that on Top $5$ ownersbip in column 2 in Table 2, Panel A (-0.233).  \n\nOur main analysis controls for overall institutional ownership to ensure that the main estimates capture the effect of shareholder power due to large and concentrated ownership by institutional shareholders, rather than high institutional ownership that is widely held across many investors. We examine the robustness of our baseline results by employing an alternative specification that scales the measures of top and blockholder ownership by overallinstitutional ownership, instead of including it as a control variable. This alternative variable measures the relative importance of large institutional ownership among all institutional owners (same as the institution type shares employed in Section 4.3). The estimation results shown in Row C of Table 4 are largely similar to the baseline results in Tables 2 and 3. As the fraction of shares owned by top or blockholding institutions among all institutional ownership increases, employment and payroll of establishments owned by the firm decrease (all coefficients are significant at the $1\\%$ level). The coefficients on Top $5$ ownership/ Overall institutional ownersbip in columns 2 (-0.134) and 5 (-0.142) show that when the relative importance of top five institutional ownership (among all institutional ownership) increases by 10 percentage points, the establishment's employment and payroll would decline by $1.3\\%$ and $1.4\\%$ .Thus, Row C of Table 4 confirms that the baseline results are robust to how we control for overall institutional ownership. In addition, Row D of Table 4 shows that the results are also robust to another sensitivity check on the baseline specification, which is to drop the control for Overall institutional ownership altogether.  \n\n#### 3.2.3. Alternative specifications  \n\nIn additional robustness analysis, we consider two alternative specifications. First, we repeat the analysis at the firm instead of the establishment level using a specification that includes firm fixed effects and is otherwise the same as the baseline. While the establishmentlevel specification is more conservative because it controls for more granular establishment fixed effects, one concern is that it may under-estimate the labor impact because it focuses on the within-establishment intensive margin. In comparison, the firm-level specification examines whether large institutional owners affect employees also via the potentially important extensive margins, which include closure or sales of existing establishments (\\*establishment exit'\") and creation or purchases of new establishments (\"establishment entry\"). Panel A of Appendix Table A1 presents the results.? The firm-level estimates remain highly significant and are somewhat larger in magnitude than their establishment-level counterparts, suggesting that large institutional shareholders affect employees both at the intensive and extensive margins.  \n\nSecond, we employ an alternative specification that uses growth rates of establishmentlevel employment and payroll, instead of their log's, as dependent variables. Specifically, we estimate the following regression:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{g r o w t h_{i j k t}=\\alpha_{k t}+\\beta_{1}L a r g e I n s t i t u t i o n a l O w n e r s h i p_{j t-1}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\beta_{2}O v e r a l l I n s t i t u t i o n a l O w n e r s h i p_{j t-1}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\gamma^{\\prime}X_{i t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i j k t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere growt $b_{i j k,t}$ is the symmetric growth rate of total employment or payroll, defined as $(y_{i j k,t}-$ $y_{i j k t-1})/(y_{i j k t}+y_{i j k t-1})/2$ 7 indexes establishment, / firm, $k$ industry, and $t$ year; and all other variables are defined as in Eq. (1), except that $X_{i t-1}$ also includes establishment age. We use a symmetric measure of employment and payroll growth following Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996) to ensure that the result is not driven by the very largest employment or payrollincreases and decreases. We do not include establishment fixed effects in Eq. (2), given that calculating the growth rates within establishments is equivalent to differencing out the fixed effects in the outcome variables.  \n\nAppendix Table A1, Panel B shows estimation results of Eq. (2). The coefficients on top and block institutional ownership variables show a negative within-establishment relation between shareholder power and employment and pay growth rates, consistent with our baseline results for level changes. The negative relation is more pronounced for payroll growth relative to employment growth. For example, estimates in columns 1 and 5 show that a tenpercentage point increase in top institutional ownership is associated with a 0.3-percentage point reduction in employment growth rate but with a 0.8-percentage point reduction in payroll growth rate. This finding indirectly suggests that greater ownership by large institutional investors is associated with lower per-employee wage growth. Similarly, columns 2-3 and 6-7 show that top five and total block institutional ownership variables are also associated with slower employment and pay growth, while columns 4 and 8 indicate a muted effect of the HHI of institutional ownership on the growth of labor. Overall, we find qualitatively consistent results using growth rates of the employee outcomes as dependent variable, in place of the levels along with establishment fixed effects.  \n\nAn important question relevant for aggregate implications of our micro-level results is how powerful institutional investors “allocate” employment and payroll cuts across establishments of different sizes. One possibility is that powerful institutions prefer cutting both employment and payroll at larger establishments to reduce overall labor costs, which would imply a considerable aggregate effect of shareholder power both on employment and wages. Alternatively, powerful institutions might focus on cutting wages at larger establishments by exploiting their bargaining power while keeping their employment (perhaps because the larger establishments are more productive - see, e.g, Bento and Restuccia, 2017). This alternative scenario would imply that the negative effect of powerful shareholders on aggregate labor may be more pronounced for wages than employment. We explore these possibilities by re-estimating Eq. (2) with establishment observations weighted by their employment.1o  \n\nPanel C of Appendix Table A1 shows estimation results. We find that when establishments are weighted by size, the estimated relation between ownership of large institutions and employment growth is largely statistically insignificant and economically small (columns 1 through 4). In contrast, the presence of powerful institutional shareholders is associated with a significant reduction in establishment-level payroll growth (columns 5 to 8) and pay per employee growth (columns 9 to 12). For example, the coefficient on Top 5 ownersbip in column 6 is -0.075 and significant at a less than $1\\%$ level, comparable with an unweighted estimate for payroll growth in column 6 in Panel B (-0.079). The estimate in columns 10 suggests that, when top five institutional ownership increases by 10 percentage points, the growth rate of per-employee wages would decrease by $0.47\\%$  \n\nThese results, combined with the unweighted baseline results, describe how large institutional investors cut employment and wage bills across establishments: For larger establishments (which are likely more productive), they would push for a wage cut but not necessarily a cut in overall employment. For smaller establishments (which are likely less productive), they appear to push for reductions both in head counts and wages, representing an overall down-scale of labor. Importantly, the employment-weighted results suggest that the aggregate impact of the rise of large institutional shareholders on pay and the labor share of income may be negative. We investigate this question in Section 5.11  \n\n3.3. Identification — Difference-in-differences analysis of large increases in institutional ownership  \n\nOne concern with our empirical approach so far is that powerful institutional shareholders may “cherry pick” firms they invest in. In other words, it is not that powerful institutional shareholders lead to employment and payroll cuts, but rather that they tend to invest in firms with declining labor. To address this identification challenge, which is an instance of a standard selection (or reverse causality) concern, we employ a difference-indifferences (DD) approach that exploits “large” increases in institutional ownership. Specifically, we examine a sub-sample of establishments that experience an increase in block institutional ownership by $5\\%$ or more as our “treatment”? group. We then assemble a “control\" group of establishments that experience an increase of the same size in overall institutional ownership but not block institutional ownership.12  \n\nUsing these two groups, we estimate the following difference-in-differences equation: X  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{y}_{i j k t}=\\alpha_{i\\times T r e a t}+\\alpha_{k t}+\\sum_{\\tau=-5}^{-2}\\lambda_{\\tau}d[t+\\tau]_{j t}+\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{5}\\lambda_{\\tau}d[t+\\tau]_{j t}+\\sum_{\\tau=-5}^{-2}\\delta_{\\tau}d[t+\\tau]_{j t}}\\ &{~T r e a t_{j}+\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{5}\\delta_{\\tau}d[t+\\tau]_{j t}\\times T r e a t_{j}+\\gamma^{\\prime}X_{i t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i j k t},}\\end{array}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $a_{i}{\\times}T r e a t$ represents establishment-by-treatment indicator fixed effects and $d/t{+}\\tau J_{j t}$ is an indicator variable equal to one if year $t$ is $|\\tau|$ years ( $\\langle-5\\leq\\tau\\leq5\\rangle$ before or after a large increase in block or overall institutional ownership, and zero otherwise. “Year $\\mathrm{t}{-1}^{,}$ is the baseline year and thus $d[t-1]$ is equal to zero by construction. Treat is an indicator variable equal to one if establishments of firm j experience a more than $5\\%$ increase in block institutional ownership, and zero if a more than $5\\%$ increase in overall institutional ownership but not block institutional ownership. All other variables are defined as in Eq. (1).  \n\n[Insert Table 5 here.]  \n\nThe key identifying assumption for this design is that there is no differential trend between the treatment and control groups pre-event; but not necessarily that establishments are similar across the two groups. Even then, in Table 5 we first examine the characteristics of establishments that experience large increases in block institutional ownership one year before the event relative to those of establishments that experience a large increase in overall institutional ownership. The results indicate that the two groups are comparable along observable characteristics such as employment, firm and segment size, and age, showing no evidence of selection on these observables. However, the two groups differ in terms of the level of pre-event overall institutional ownership and total block ownership. Because these differences in the levels of institutional ownership may lead to a violation of the parallel-trend assumption, in a robustness analysis below we add to the DD specification controls for preevent overall institutional ownership and total block ownership as well as their respective interactions with the event-time indicators (see Abadie, 2005).  \n\nFigure 2 presents estimates of Eq. (3). The plotted estimates are for the DD estimator of Sun and Abraham (2021), which is robust to treatment effects heterogeneity. This estimator addresses the concern that standard two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences estimates can be biased because they do not aggregate the treatment effects with appropriate weights (see also Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiess, 2021). In our seting, the concern is mitigated because we do have never-treated observations in the control group. The estimates on $d[t+\\tau]\\times T r e a t$ for the pre-event period (i.e., $\\tau=-5$ through $^{-2}$ ) are statistically insignificant and economically small, pointing to no differential pre-trends between the two groups. The coefficients on $d[t+\\tau]$ $\\times$ Treat for the post-event period are all negative, indicating that establishments that experience a large increase in block institutional ownership undergo employment and payroll losses relative to plausibly comparable establishments that experience a large increase in overall but not block institutional ownership. The estimates are significant at the $10\\%$ level or less for $\\tau$ $=2$ and $\\tau\\geq4$ when log employment is the dependent variable, and for all $\\tau>0$ when $\\mathrm{log}$ payroll is the dependent variable.  \n\nImportantly, the economic magnitude of the estimates is comparable to that of the baseline estimates in Table 3. For example, the estimates for $d[t+2]\\times T r e a t$ are -0.022 and - 0.022 for log employment and payroll and the estimates for $d[t+5]\\times T r e a,$ t are -0.024 and - 0.026, which are similar to the magnitudes of the effect of the same relative change in block institutional ownership: relative to the control group, the treated group increases block institutional ownership by 13.2 percentage points $(=0.111-(-0.021))$ on average (Table 5), which in turn implies 0.020 $\\c^{\\prime}=-0.150\\times0.132$ )and 0.022 ( $\\c=-0.166\\times0.132$ ) declines in  \n\n# Panel A - Effect on log employment  \n\n![](images/6c4cb94f62c29e2ac5ed394e7930b668ee8016a88d57c3a44d89436d462ab5b7.jpg)  \nFigure 2: Difference-in-differences analysis.

Overall, the difference-in-differences results corroborate the validity of our baseline estimates and indicate that the baseline results are unlikely to be driven by selection of institutional shareholders into firms.  \n\nIn robustness analysis, we show that the estimates on $d[t+\\tau]\\times T r e a t$ for the post-event period remain large and significant when we use standard two-way fixed effects to estimate Eq. (3) with or without controls for pre-event overall institutional ownership and total block ownership and their respective interactions with the event-time indicators (Panel A of Appendix Table A3). We also show that average post-event coefficient estimates are statistically significant and of similar economic magnitudes (Panel B of Appendix Table A3).13  \n\n## 4. Mechanism  \n\nThe analysis so far shows a consistently negative within-establishment relation between powerful institutional ownership and labor outcomes. This section explores the mechanisms that underlie the baseline relation.  \n\n### 4.1. Bargaining power of employees — labor unions and labor market concentration  \n\nA plausible mechanism for powerful shareholders to affect the firm's labor force is through bargaining. To the extent that the firm and its employees jointly create rents that are to be shared, an increase in relative bargaining power of shareholders vis-a-vis employees would lead to smaller employment and payroll, as we show. Following the literature (e.g.. Matsa, 2010; and Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim, 2022), we measure employee bargaining power relative to shareholders using industry-level unionization rates and local labor marketlevel HHI of firm employment.14 We estimate the following regression that interacts measures of large institutional ownership with the two proxies for labor bargaining power in turn:  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{{\\bf y}_{i j k c t}=\\alpha_{i}+\\alpha_{k c t}+\\beta_{1}L a r g e I O_{j t-1}+\\beta_{2}L a r g e I O_{j t-1}\\times L a b o r B a r g a i n i n g_{k c t-1}}\\end{array}$ $+\\beta_{3}L a b o r B a r g a i n i n g_{k c t-1}+\\beta_{4}O v e r a l l I O_{j t-1}+\\gamma^{'}X_{i t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i j k c t},$  \n\nwhere Labor bargainingkt1 is the one-year lagged fraction of workers covered by collective bargaining in industry $k$ or the HHI of firm employment in industry $k$ and commuting zone 心 $a_{k\\,c t}$ is industry-by-commuting zone-by-year fixed effects, and all other variables are defined as in Eq. (1). The coefficient of interest is $\\beta_{2}$ which represents the interaction effect of large, powerful institutional ownership with labor bargaining power on establishment-level employment and payroll. Standard errors are clustered at the firm (and commuting zone) level when the measure of labor bargaining power is the fraction of workers covered by collctive bargaining (HHI of firm employment in the local labor market).  \n\n[Insert Table 6 here.]  \n\nTable 6 presents estimation results for Eq. (4) that uses industry union coverage rates (Panel A) and local labor market concentration (Panel B) as proxies for labor bargaining power. The negative coefficient on Top 1 ownersbip in column 1 of Panel A confirms the baseline result that within-establishment, an increase in the largest institutional ownership is associated with a significant employment reduction. Importantly, the significantly positive coefficient on Top 1 ownership $\\times$ Union (at the $1\\%$ level) in the column shows that high union coverage, which increases employee bargaining power, mitigates the negative effect of powerful institutional owners on employment. The estimates indicate that in industries where union coverage is zero, a ten-percentage point increase in the largest institutional ownership is associated with a $4.1\\%$ reduction in employment. However, in industries where collective bargaining coverage is oneSD above its mean $(=18.4\\%)$ , the same magnitude increase in top institutional ownership is related with a much smaller $0.7\\%$ reduction in employment. The estimates in column 5 show a very similar magnitude of the mitigating effect of labor unions on payroll reductions.  \n\nSimilarly, estimates in columns 2-3 and 6-7 show that the negative effects of top five institutions and total blockholder ownership are mitigated when labor unions provide stronger bargaining power to employees. Across the columns, the interaction effects of large shareholders’ ownership and union coverage rates are significant at the $1\\%$ to $5\\%$ levels. Columns 4 and 8 show that labor unions might also mitigate the effect of concentrated institutional ownership, although the estimated positive coefficients on HHI institutional ownersbip $\\times$ Union is insignificant at a conventional level. Taken together, the results in Panel A are consistent with higher collective bargaining coverage improving labor's bargaining power against shareholders, thereby mitigating the negative effect of large, powerful shareholders on the quantity of labor. A mutually non-exclusive explanation is that the (positive) effect of labor unions on employment and payroll (e.g, Freeman and Medoff, 1984) is more pronounced in the presence of powerful institutional shareholders.  \n\nFinally, the estimates in Panel B of Table 6 further corroborate the bargaining power interpretation of the baseline results. The coefficients on the interaction terms between large shareholder ownership and local labor market concentration are negative and generally statistically significant, indicating that powerful institutional shareholders have more negative effects on employment and payroll in more concentrated labor markets, in which firms presumably have greater bargaining power vis- $\\grave{\\cdot}\\grave{\\mathrm{a}}$ -visworkers.  \n\n### 4.2. Impact of powerful institutional investors on labor productivity and sharebolder value  \n\nWe further clarify the mechanism by examining the impact of powerful shareholders on firm-level labor productivity and shareholder returns per worker. If the employment and payroll losses are due to greater monitoring of managers and a reduction in their preference for quiet life, for example, then we would expect to see an improvement in overall labor efficiency as well. In contrast, bargaining and rent extraction would imply either no effect on productivity, if shareholder power simply reallocates cash flows away from workers, or even a loss in joint output and productivity, if the reallocation leads to inefficiencies such as loss of employee human capital or trust and morale (see Summers and Shleifer, 1988). To explore these predictions, we use information on firm revenues from the revenue-enhanced LBD (RE LBD) and estimate a variant of the baseline specification in Eq. (1) using firm-year observations from 1997 through 2015 with the log of revenues per employee as the dependent variable.15  \n\nFigure 3 shows a negative relation between labor productivity and all four measures of shareholder power. The coefficient estimates are significant at the $10\\%$ level or less for all proxies but the ownership HHI. The estimate for Total block ownersbip implies that, when a given establishment experiences a ten-percentage point increase in block institutional ownership, its labor productivity declines by $4.1\\%$ within one year. In Panel A2 of Appendix Table A5, we examine the dynamic relation in more detail and find that the labor productivity effect becomes economically smaller within two years and largely insignificant within three years. The negative short-run impact on labor productivity is more consistent with bargaining or rent-extraction than monitoring.  \n\nFurther supporting bargaining and conflicts of interests between powerful shareholders and workers, Figure 3 shows that there is a significantly positive relation between large shareholder ownership and shareholder returns per employee, defined as the change in log market value of equity per employee from Compustat, a measure of “shareholder value.\" Specifically, the figure shows a consistently positive relation between shareholder returns and the four measures of shareholder power, which is significant at the $10\\%$ level or less for all proxies. The relation with shareholder returns is also economically significant. For example, the estimate for Total block ownersbip implies that, when a given establishment experiences a ten-percentage point increase in block institutional ownership, its shareholder returns increase by $6.3\\%$ . Overall, the results in Figure 3 suggest that the negative effects of powerful institutional shareholders on labor are more likely due to conflicts of interest that lead to a redistribution of rents from workers to shareholders, rather than strict monitoring of management in terms of its relationship with employees.16  \n\n![](images/341eac922a6833e220d208fd5039ee49f9ad3458c26a8fe53f7cd0422950e388.jpg)  \nFigure 3: Mechanism - Impact on labor productivity and shareholder value. This figure plots estimates of the effect of large institutional owners on labor productivity and shareholder value. The dependent variable is the log of labor productivity, which is measured as revenue per employee from the revenue-enhanced LBD (red line, circle marker) and the logarithmic change in stock market value per employee, measured as the ratio of stock market capitalization to number of employees from Compustat (blue line, triangle marker). Variables for institutional ownership are lagged by one year. Detailed estimates are reported in Panel A1 of Appendix Table A5. The $90\\%$ confidence intervals are based on standard errors adjusted for sample clustering at the firm level.  \n\n### 4.3. Types of institutional sbarebolders  \n\nIn our final tests to probe the mechanism, we examine what types of institutional investors drive the relation between shareholder power and establishment-level labor outcomes. Specifically, we follow Bushee's (1998) classification of institutional ownership into “quasi-index,”“dedicated,” and “transient” types. In addition, we define “activist” institutional investors following Grennan (2019), who bases a classification on whether a given institution has engaged in shareholder activism campaigns.17 We then calculate the percentage of shares owned by each of the institutional investor types scaled by overall percentage institutional  \n\nOwnership. Thus, these measures capture the relative importance of specific institution types among all institutional investors? ownership for a given firm. We employ the measures in a variant of Eq. (1) in which the control for overall institutional ownership is dropped, given that the overall ownership is already controlled for by scaling the large institutional ownership Variables by it.  \n\nTable 7 presents estimation results. Columns 1 and 5 show that an increase in quasiindex ownership share among overall institutional ownership is associated with increases in establishment employment and payroll. Similarly, an increase in the share of transient institutional ownership is significantly associated with higher payroll (column 6), although its association with employment is insignificant (column 2). A plausible interpretation of the positive or insignificant relations is that quasi-index and transient funds are less likely to engage management relative to other types of institutions in the governance of labor.  \n\n[Insert Table 7 here.]  \n\nIn contrast, we find that the association between the relative ownership share of dedicated institutions, which have long-term investment horizons and stronger incentives to engage management (due to their concentrated holdings), and employment or payroll is significantly negative at the $1\\%$ level. The coefficients on Dedicated ownersbip/ Overall institutional ownersbip in columns 3 and 7 show that a ten-percentage point increase in the relative share of dedicated institutional ownership is associated with $0.6\\%$ reductions both in employment and payroll.  \n\nThe largest magnitude of the negative effect on labor comes from activist institutional investors. The coefficients on Activist ownership/ Overall institutional ownership in columns 4 (- 0.697) and 8 (-0.718) are significant at the $1\\%$ level. The estimates suggest that a ten-percentage point increase in activist institutional ownership shares among general institutional ownership would result in $6.7\\%$ to $6.9\\%$ reductions in establishment employment and payroll. This large, negative association between activist shareholders and employment and wage bills is consistent with evidence in Brav, Jiang, and Kim (2015), who focus on hedge fund activism events and manufacturing plants from 1994 to 2008.  \n\nOverall, the results in this section are consistent with dedicated (who hold concentrated ownership over a relatively long horizon) and activist institutions (who engage in shareholder activism campaigns) pushing for a reduction in labor in the interest of shareholder value. One way for activist (and dedicated) investors to affect firms’ labor is through intervention and public engagement with management. Panel B of Appendix Table A5 offers direct supporting evidence for this mechanism. We re-estimate our baseline specification in Eq. (1) at the firm level using an indicator for whether a firm becomes the target of a shareholder activism campaign in a given year as the dependent variable.18 The coefficient estimates are all positive and statistically significant across our four proxies, indicating that powerful shareholder-owned firms are more likely to be targets of activism campaigns.  \n\nIn addition, textual analysis of the announcements indicates that activism works through two main types of actions: formal proxy fights and shareholder proposals at annual meetings or soft engagement via public announcements in the press and newswires. We find that approximately three quarters of the target firms are involved in the former type of campaign, while about two thirds are involved in the latter. As for the stated objectives of the campaigns, about $45\\%$ of the campaigns involve firm operations, about $23\\%$ involve shareholder rights and maximizing shareholder value, and about $33\\%$ involve mergers and restructurings.  \n\nAnecdotal evidence also suggests that activist campaigns often directly target job cuts as important cost cutting measures to reduce operating expenses and boost shareholder value. For example, see “Canadian Pacific To Cut 4,500 Jobs,”\" The Wall Street Journal, December 12, 2012. After activist investor Bill Ackman won a proxy battle at Canadian Pacific, the railroad company decided to cut $23\\%$ of their workforce under its new chief executive Hunter Harrison who was appointed by Ackman. Similarly, on November 28, 2012, Icahn Capital LP announced its intention to discuss the operations and direction of Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and the company's plans to manage expenses and preserve value for shareholders. And on April 26, 2001, GAMCO Investors, Inc. announced that Mario Gabelli sent a letter to the board of directors of Carter-Wallace, Inc. expressing its views that restructuring of the business from an operational and financial point of view was needed.  \n\n## 5. Aggregate Implications  \n\nAs a first step toward examining the aggregate implications of our micro evidence, we perform a simple back-of-the-envelope counterfactual exercise to provide a first indication of how much of the time-series decline in labor income we can explain with rising shareholder power. Using the main estimates from Table 3 (Panel A, column 3), we calculate the implied time-series effect given the change in average block ownership from 1980 to 2014. The results shown in Figure 4 indicate that the rise in shareholder power explains about a 1.5 percentagepoint decline, which is roughly one-quarter of the overall decline in total wages and salaries relative to GDI.  \n\n![](images/9f9c3548c324101152f3e5c615460fa183d49737f7edb77224ff7f4b5e2e1e35.jpg)  \nFigure 4: Aggregate Implications, 1980-2014. This figure plots the ratio of total wage and salary accruals to domestic gross income (GDI) (blue solid line) and the counterfactual ratio of total wage and salary accruals to GDI (red dotted line) in the US for the period 1980-2014. The counterfactual ratio is constructed as the actual ratio minus the product of the estimated coefficient on block institutional ownership from Table 3 (Panel A, column 3, -0.166) times the change in average blockholder ownership in a given year relative to 1980. The compensation-to-GDI ratio is from the Federal Reserve Economic Data. Block institutional ownership is the percentage owned by institutional blockholders, defined as the institutional investors with more than $5\\%$ holdings as filed through Form 13D, 13F, or 13G. The average block ownership is calculated excluding firms in the agriculture, financial, utilities, and public administration sectors.  \n\nOf course, this graphical analysis is illustrative and subject to the concern that we extrapolate the estimate from micro data to make inference for the aggregate, which may not be valid if, for example, general or industry equilibrium effects lead to different estimates for the aggregates. Therefore, we next examine this possibility more closely using a more formal analysis of the aggregate implications. Specifically, we repeat the analysis of the effect of large institutional ownership on employment and payroll at the aggregate industry sector level. Following Autor et al. (2020), we aggregate at the following industry sectors: manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, and services.1 In addition to the log of employment and payroll, we also explore the implications for the labor share of income, defined as the ratio of payroll to revenues at the sector level.2° To preserve the full time-series, we retrieve firm-level revenues from Compustat.21  \n\n# [Insert Table 8 here.]  \n\nTable 8 shows sector-level estimation results using the top one and five as well as the block institutional ownership variables. Columns 1 to 3 present the within-sector relation between ownership of large institutional shareholders and the labor share of income, while columns 4 to 6 and 7 to 9 are for log employment and payroll, respectively. In line with the establishment-level estimates, the sector-level coefficient estimates are all negative and highly statistically significant in the majority of cases. To provide a comparative assessment of economic magnitudes, we calculate the implied change for a one-standard deviation (1-SD)  \n\nchange in the explanatory variable. For example, the unconditional within-sector standard deviation of the block ownership variable is $2.8\\%$ . Thus, the coefficient estimate on Total block ownersbip in column 9 implies that a 1-SD increase in block ownership in a given sector is associated with a $10.9\\%$ $(=\\exp(-4.107~\\times~0.028)-1)$ decline in the sector's payroll. The corresponding coefficients at the establishment and firm level in column 3 in Table 3 (Panel A) and column 7 in Appendix Table A1 (Panel A), respectively, show similarly sizeable though a bit smaller economic magnitudes. In response to a 1-SD increase in block ownership, the implied within-establishment decline in payroll is by $2.4\\%$ $(=\\exp(-0.166\\times0.145)-1)$ and the implied within-firm decline in payroll is by $6.6\\%$ $(=\\exp(-0.474\\times0.145)-1)$ . Thus, the aggregate analysis further strengthens the material labor impact of rising shareholder power.  \n\nWe now turn to the implications for the labor share. Between 1981 and 2015, the sector-level labor share declined by 6.8 percentage points on average, which is comparable to the aggregate time-series decline in Figure 4. Over the same period, the sector-level block institutional ownership increased, on average, by 8.9 percentage points. Thus, the coefficient estimate in column 3 in Table 8 (-0.215) implies that the sector-level change in the labor share that can be atributed to the increase in block institutional ownership is -1.9 percentage points $(=-0.215\\times0.089)$ , which is comparable to our earlier back-of-the-envelope estimate in Figure 4 and corresponds to over one-quarter of the overall average decline of the labor share in the aggregated sector sample. These results suggest that shareholder power can explain part of the aggregate decline of payroll relative to measures of output.  \n\nIn Appendix Table A6, we provide additional estimates to clarify the intuition of the aggregate results for the labor share. First, a negative relation between large institutional ownership and the labor share may appear inconsistent with our earlier finding of a negative relation with labor productivity (Figure 3), as the labor share and labor productivity are inversely related. However, the key difference between the two results lies in aggregation. Panel A of Appendix Table A6 shows that, when we run the analysis of the firm-level labor share by weighting the observations using firm revenues (columns 1-3), the relation with the large institutional ownership variables becomes negative (albeit insignificant). Second, the negative relation between sector-level large shareholder ownership and the labor share is consistent with our earlier finding of a significant negative relation with the growth rate of wages per employee in employment-weighted regressions (see Appendix Table A1, Panel A), suggesting that cuts in wage rates are an important margin for larger firms. Because these firms represent a disproportionate share of aggregate revenues, they also drive the negative relation with the labor share in the aggregate.  \n\nTo further examine the notion that aggregation drives the sector-level result, we decompose the overall effect on the labor share by margin using the decomposition approach of Melitz and Polanec (2015) and Autor et al. (2020). First, we show that the sector-level implications for the labor share are robust to using a specification that uses first differences instead of levels (Panel B of Appendix Table A6). Importantly, in Panels C and D we find that for most specifications the reallocation component, which captures the effect of (changes in) value-weighting, contributes to the overall effect on the sector-level labor share by as much or more than the unweighted component.2  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nLabor markets in the US have experienced a pronounced transformation over the last decades, with labor income stagnating despite strong productivity and profit growth. This paper sets forth an explanation based on the ownership structure of public firms. Motivated by the classical agency theory of the firm based on conflicts of interests between shareholders and stakeholders, we conjecture that increases in the concentration of more powerful institutional shareholders reduce employment and labor income, because the objectives and interests of the shareholders more likely conflict with those of the workers. Using confidential establishment-level data from the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Business Database from 1982-2015, we provide comprehensive evidence that supports this explanation. Increases in concentration of institutional ownership lower establishment employment and payroll, while raising shareholder value without apparent increases in labor productivity. Overall, these findings suggest employment policies aimed at reforming shareholder capitalism by broadening the objective of the firm beyond the more narrow maximization of shareholder value, such as increasing labor representation on boards or allowing for labor participation in firm governance, may help to raise employment and wages. Future research should examine the impact of concentrated institutional ownership and policies affecting governance on the outcomes of different type of workers.  \n\n# References  \n\nAbadie, Aiberto, ZUU5, \"Semiparametric Difference-in-Differences Estimators, Keview Of Economic Studies 72(1), 1-19.   \nAcemoglu, Daron, 2002, “Technical Change, Inequality, and the Labor Market,\" Journal of Economic Literature 40(1), 7-72.   \nAcemoglu, Daron, David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon H.

In Panel A, we repeat the baseline analysis afer excluding firms that eventually undergo bankruptcy or are involved in acquisitions. The information on bankruptcies and acquisitions is from the Compustat delisting reason variable (DLRSN). The specification and variable definitions are otherwise the same as in the baseline. In Panel B, we repeat the analysis using a firm-level layoff indicator as the dependent variable (Columns 1 to 4). The information on layoffs announcements is from two data sources: the press, which we hand-collect from the Wall Street Journal and other major news sources using Factiva and LexisNexis news searches, and Capital IQ's Key Development database (see Falato and Liang (2016) for additional details). Combining these two sources leads to an incidence of layoff announcements of about $8.5\\%$ of the firm-year bervations.We also perform textual analysis of the news rleases togather more granular information on whether the layoff is motivated by cost-cutting reasons, whose incidence is about $2.6\\%$ of the firm-year observations (Columns 5 to 8). Finally, we also use downsizing announcements from Capital IQ's Key Development database, whose incidence is about $12\\%$ of the firm-year observations (Columns 9 to 12). Variables for institutional ownership are lagged by one year. The $\\mathrm{\\Delta}t$ statistics based on standard errors adjusted for sample clustering at the firm level are reported below the coefficient estimates. The numbers of observations are rounded in Panel A to follow the Census Bureau's disclosure rules.  \n\n# Appendix Table A3: Detailed DD estimates and robustness to alternative specifications  \n\nPanel A: Detailed DD estimates and robustness to Sun and Abraham (2021) estimator   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">(1) No control for</td><td colspan=\"2\">(3)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">pre-event diff. in IO</td><td colspan=\"2\">Control for pre- event diff. in IO</td><td colspan=\"2\">Sun and Abraham (2021)</td></tr><tr><td>Log emp.</td><td>Log pay</td><td>Log emp.</td><td>Log pay</td><td>Log emp.</td><td>Log pay</td></tr><tr><td>Treat × d[t-5]</td><td>-0.016</td><td>-0.006</td><td>-0.014</td><td>-0.004</td><td>-0.006</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-1.32</td><td>-0.58</td><td>-1.10</td><td>-0.39</td><td>-0.56</td><td>0.15</td></tr><tr><td>Treat × d[t-4]</td><td>-0.005</td><td>0.001</td><td>-0.001</td><td>-0.003</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.004</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.37</td><td>0.06</td><td>-0.11</td><td>-0.31</td><td>0.34</td><td>0.40</td></tr><tr><td>Treat × d[t-3]</td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.002</td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.004</td><td>-0.008</td><td>-0.001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-1.05</td><td>-0.23</td><td>-0.91</td><td>-0.48</td><td>-0.72</td><td>-0.08</td></tr><tr><td>Treat × d[t-2]</td><td>-0.007</td><td>0.000</td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.005</td><td>-0.007</td><td>0.005</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-1.09</td><td>-0.03</td><td>-1.19</td><td>-0.52</td><td>-0.87</td><td>0.68</td></tr><tr><td>Treat X d[t-1]</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Treat × d[t]</td><td>-0.007</td><td>-0.012</td><td>-0.013</td><td>-0.016</td><td>-0.013</td><td>-0.014</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.89</td><td>-1.43</td><td>-1.28</td><td>-1.74</td><td>-1.59</td><td>-1.59</td></tr><tr><td>Treat × d[t+1]</td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.025</td><td>-0.023</td><td>-0.023</td><td>-0.012</td><td>-0.026</td></tr><tr><td>Treat × d[t+2]</td><td>-1.02</td><td>-2.72</td><td>-1.94</td><td>-2.35</td><td>-1.12</td><td>-2.71</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.022</td><td>-0.021</td><td>-0.033</td><td>-0.035</td><td>-0.022</td><td>-0.022</td></tr><tr><td>Treat × d[t+3]</td><td>-2.11</td><td>-2.29</td><td>-2.56</td><td>-2.55</td><td>-2.03</td><td>-1.95</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.014</td><td>-0.022</td><td>-0.019</td><td>-0.031</td><td>-0.017</td><td>-0.028</td></tr><tr><td>Treat × d[t+4]</td><td>-1.22</td><td>-2.10</td><td>-1.29</td><td>-2.60</td><td>-1.40</td><td>-2.52</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.020</td><td>-0.019</td><td>-0.020</td><td>-0.025</td><td>-0.029</td><td>-0.025</td></tr><tr><td>Treat × d[t+5]</td><td>-1.82</td><td>-1.68</td><td>-1.30</td><td>-1.75</td><td>-2.42</td><td>-1.76</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.022</td><td>-0.021</td><td>-0.024</td><td>-0.024</td><td>-0.024</td><td>-0.026</td></tr><tr><td>Establishment-level controls</td><td>-1.68</td><td>-1.97</td><td>-1.37</td><td>-1.77</td><td>-1.73</td><td>-1.86</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>Establishment-treat fixed effects</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>Industry-year fixed effects Control for overall and block IO</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>(t-1 or earlier) × event indicators</td><td></td><td></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>9,251,000</td><td>9,251,000</td><td>9,251,000</td><td>9,251,000</td><td>9,251,000</td><td>9,251,000</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.9178</td><td>0.9323</td><td>0.9179</td><td>0.9323</td><td>0.9294</td><td>0.9412</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B: Robustness to before-after DD   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Dep.

All rights reserved.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThe use of industrial robots has become a central feature of modern manufacturing. Although advanced industrial countries, such as the United States, Japan and Germany, have been traditionally dominant players in developing and adopting robotics technology, China plays an increasingly important role in the adoption of industrial robots. Estimated operation stock of industrial robots in China increased from around 1.6 thousand in 2001 to 97 thousand in 2012, according to data from the International Federation of Robotics (henceforth “IFR\"). Since 2016, China has been the largest user of industrial robots in the world (Cheng et al., 2019).  \n\nThe rapid adoption of industrial robots in China is commonly attributed to rising labor costs.1 However, empirical evidence on this issue is scarce. In this paper, we study the causal effects of higher labor costs on Chinese firms' adoption of robots.  \n\nAn empirical study on the effects of labor costs on firms' adoption of robots has to confront two major challenges. First, measuring robot adoption at the firm level is dificult. Data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), which is the most influential source of data for robot adoption, are available only at the country-industry level. To make progress on this front, we use information about imported robots from the customs data to measure the adoption of robots in China. This is a sensible approach, because according to the 2014 IFR report, the vast majority of robots used in China over our sample period (2004-2012) were imported from countries such as the United States, Japan, and Germany. We merge the information on imported robots with a dataset on manufacturing firms from the Annual Surveys of Industrial Firms (henceforth “AsIF\"). Doing so allows us to study adoption behaviors in a panel of manufacturing firms.  \n\nThe second challenge is the potential endogeneity of labor costs with respect to firms' adoption of robots. To isolate exogenous shocks to labor costs, we focus on the minimum wages in China, which vary across cities. Minimum wages in China have increased substantially in recent years and have been cited as an important factor in rising labor costs (Gan et al., 2016). The large variation in minimum wages across cities and over time is particularly helpful for studying the effects of rising labor costs. To address endogeneity concerns, we follow the methodology in Dube et al. (2010), who use contiguous county pairs across state borders in the United States to identify the employment effects of minimum wages. We construct a dataset of all city pairs in China that cross provincial borders, as in Fan et al. (2018b). We then include city-pair-year fixed effects in our panel regressions to purge out spatially correlated unobserved factors.  \n\nIn Section 3, we develop a model in which workers and robots are substitutes in production. Firms decide whether to adopt robots by comparing the marginal profits from adoption versus the fixed cost of adoption. In the model, only more productive firms choose to adopt robots. We derive two testable hypotheses from this simple model. First, a rise in labor costs increases a firm's probability of adopting robots. Second, the effect of higher labor costs on the probability of adoption is stronger for firms with higher productivity and lower fixed cost of adoption.  \n\nWe study the effects of higher minimum wages on robot adoption using city-pair firm-level data over 2004-2012. We find that an increase in the minimum wage has only a small effect on the probability of adopting robots in the full sample of firms. However, this finding masks large variation in the effects over time and across firms. When we examine the effects of labor costs on robot adoption separately for 2004-2007 and 2008-2012, we find negligible effects of minimum wages on robot adoption for the earlier period, but a much larger and statistically significant effect over the later period.2 For a $10\\%$ increase in the minimum wage over 2008-2012, the probability of adoption increases by 0.11 percentage points, relative to firms in the other cities. ince the average probability of robot adoption is only $0.19\\%$ over the later period, the magnitude of this estimated effect is large.  \n\nWe study the heterogeneous effects of higher minimum wages on firms' adoption of robot along several dimensions. For each of the dimensions studied, we find the effects to be more dispersed for 2008-2012 than for 2004-2007, in line with the finding that minimum wages have a larger and more significant effect on firms' adoption of robots over the later half of our sample period. Consistent with our model, we find the effects to be stronger for firms with higher productivity. We find the effects of minimum wages on robot adoption to apply to firms from the coastal region, but not to those from the inland region. In terms of firms' ownership type, although minimum wages have statistically significant effects on the adoption by both private firms and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) over 2008-2012, the magnitude is much larger for private firms than for SOEs. The effects of minimum wages on robot adoption hold for a large number of industries, but the magnitudes of the effects substantially vary across industries. Finally, relating the heterogeneous effects to industry characteristics, we find the effects of minimum wages on robot adoption to be stronger for industries that employ skilled labor more intensively. These results suggest that the relationship between labor costs and robot adoption is influenced by a myriad of factors, such as firm productivity, geographic location, and industry-specific robotics technology.3  \n\nWe conduct additional analysis to examine the robustness of our baseline results. To account for other potential confounding factors, we add additional control variables, including measures for trade exposure, fixed capital investment and demographic characteristics, to the regressions. Since our main coefficients of interest are not substantively changed from our baseline regressions, our results are not likely to be driven by these factors. To address the issue that our baseline firm-level analysis omits smaller firms outside the ASIF dataset, we construct a city panel of robot imports based solely on the customs database, which include robot imports by firms both inside and outside the AsIF. We then study the effects of minimum wages on total quantity of adopted robots in a panel of cities. Consistent with our firm-level results, we find large effects of higher minimum wages on robot adoption over 2008-2012, but we do not find any effects for 2004-2007.  \n\nTo address the concern that our estimates may be driven by the omission of domestically produced robots, we make use of the fact that the main customers of Chinese robot suppliers are concentrated in four industries (2014 IFR). We show that higher minimum wages have large and positive effects on robot adoption also for the industries to which Chinese robot manufacturers do not supply many robots. To address the issue that robots observed in the custom database may be imported by robot manufacturers in China either as intermediate input or for R&D purpose, we use firm names to identify potential manufacturer of robots in the AsIF. We then repeat our baseline analysis after dropping these firms as well as those in the same 4-digit industry. Our baseline results are robust to the exclusion of these potential robot manufacturers from the sample.  \n\nOur paper contributes to understanding the intricate relationship between industrial robots and the labor markets. Perhaps because of the widespread concerns in many countries that robots may make workers redundant (Ford, 2015), the predominant focus of the literature is on the employment-reducing effects of robot adoption. Related papers include Acemoglu et al. (2020), Bessen et al., 2019, Carbonero et al., 2018, Dauth et al., 2018, Dixon et al., 2020, Dinlersoz and Wolf (2018), Giuntella et al., 2019 and Koch et al., 2019, among others. Nevertheless, a smaller number of papers, including those by Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018 and Cheng et al. (2019), study factors affecting robot adoptions. Our paper belongs to the latter category. Much of the empirical literature on robot adoption is based on the data provided by the IFR (2014 IFR). Examples of studies using the IFR data include Graetz and Michaels (2018), Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018, de Backer et al., 2018, and Krenz et al. (2018). The industry-level variation in the IFR data can combine with variation in local industry composition to measure local exposure to robot adoption, as in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) for the United States, Chiacchio et al., 2018 for the EU. In contrast, our procedure of relying on customs data to infer robot adoption at the firm level is similar to that in Humlum (2019).4 Different from Humlum (2019) which studies the interaction between robot adoption and labor market dynamics, we focus on the causal link between rising labor costs and robot adoption in China. We see our paper, and other papers using the customs transaction to measure robot adoption such as Humlum (2019), as complements to the papers based on aggregate IFR data.  \n\nThe literature on minimum wages primarily focuses on the employment effects in developed countries, particularly in the United States (Brown et al., 1982; Card and Krueger, 1994; Neumark and Wascher, 2000; Dube et al., 2010; Autor et al., 2016, among others). Recent studies, including those by Aaronson and Phelan (2017) and Lordan and Neumark (2018), emphasize the differences between jobs in terms of their susceptibility to automation, for example as measured by the routine task intensity (RTI) index from Autor and Dorn (2013). These studies find that an increase in the minimum wage leads to a reduction in employment in the more automatable occupations. An assumption underlying these studies is that the adoption of automation technology, such as industrial robots, is responsible for these effects. However, because of data availability, few studies consider the effects of higher minimum wages on the adoption of industrial robots. Our paper flls this gap.  \n\nOur paper is more closely related to the strand of papers on the minimum wages in China, including Wang and Gunderson (2011), Huang et al., 2014, Fang and Lin (2015), Long and Yang (2016), Hau et al., 2016, Gan et al. (2016) and Mayneris et al. (2018). The literature consistently finds that minimum wages in China have large effects on frms' performance and operating decisions. The closest paper to ours is Fan et al. (2018b), who study the effects of minimum wages on firms' decisions to conduct foreign direct investment (FD1) in other countries, thereby substituting domestic labor inputs with foreign labor inputs in production. This paper complements Fan et al. (2018b) by studying the effects of higher minimum wages on the adoption of robots, which is another way to substitute away from labor use.5  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the relevant institutional background; Section 3 presents a simple theoretical model and discusses the testable implications; Section 4 presents our empirical specification and the data; Section 5 presents the main results; Section 6 discusses heterogeneous effects; Section 7 discusses the robustness of the main results; and Section 8 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Background  \n\n### 2.1. Minimum wage in China  \n\nIn this section, we briefly discuss the institutional background on minimum wages in China. Related studies, such as those by Fan et al. (2018b) and Fang and Lin (2015), provide further details. China's first national minimum wage regulations were issued in 1993 and written into the Labor Law in 1994. Provincial governments are granted substantial flexibility in setting their own minimum wages (Wang and Gunderson, 2011). Local minimum wages can vary by city within a province according to local economic conditions.  \n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Labor and Social Security introduced the Minimum Wage Regulations in 2004. Provincial governments from then on are required to renew the standard of the minimum wage at least once every 2 years. Adjustments to the local minimum wages have become more frequent and are accompanied by rapid increases. The 2o04 regulations significantly strengthened the enforcement of the minimum wage system by increasing the penalties for violations. Compliance with the minimum wage regulation has substantially improved over time (Du et al., 2016). Recent studies, such as those by Gan et al. (2016) and Fan et al. (2018b), find larger effects of minimum wages after 2004 on firms' export and FDI decisions, respectively. Therefore, we focus our analysis on the years after 2004.  \n\nIn 2008, the government introduced a new Labor Contract Law (Du et al., 2016; Gallagher et al., 2015). The new law is considered be highly protective of workers, with extensive regulations on labor contracts and severance conditions. Importantly, the new law reinforced the importance of minimum wage standards for the labor market in China (Huang et al., 2014). Du et al., 2016 find the 2008 law significantly contributed to the uniform enforcement of labor regulations across Chinese cities.  \n\n### 2.2. Robots in China  \n\nFollowing studies like Graetz and Michaels (2018) and Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018, we focus on the adoption of industrial robots. According to IS0 8373:2012, an industrial robot refers to “automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator, programmable in three or more axes, which can be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications.\"6 Industrial robots have played an increasingly important role in modern manufacturing. Graetz and Michaels (2018) calculates that robot density, defined as the stock of robots per million hours worked, increased bymorethan $150\\%$ , from 0.58 in 1993 to 1.48 in 2007, for the seventeen developed countries in their study. The operational stock of industrial robots worldwide increased from 1.04 million units in 2008 to 1.33 million units in 2013, an increase of $7.8\\%$ per year (2014 IFR). Industries with the heaviest use of industrial robots are the automotive industry and the electrical/electronics industries, accounting for $38\\%$ and $18\\%$ of the total stock at the end of 2013.  \n\nGrowth in the adoption of robots in China is even more striking. The estimated operation stock of industrial robots increased from around 1.6 thousand in 2001 to 97 thousand in 2012.7 By 2013, China ranked 5th among countries with highest operational stocks of industrial robots (Cheng et al., 2019). Most of the robots in China were imported from Japan, Europe or North America before 2013. According to the 2014 IFR report, of the 23 thousand new robot shipments to China in 2012, only about 3 thousand were produced by Chinese suppliers, and this domestic share of new robots was even lower before2012.8  \n\nThe adoption of industrial robots in China has continued at a rapid pace since 2012. In 2016, China overtook Japan as the country with the largest operational stock, accounting for $19\\%$ of the total worldwide stock of industrial robots (Cheng et al., 2019). Rapid adoption has been accompanied by growing robot production in China by both domestic and foreign firms. Between 2012 and 2017, the number of robots produced in China grew by as much as $86\\%$ per year. In 2017, about $30\\%$ of the robots produced in China were made by domestic firms.  \n\nGovernment policy plays a prominent role in the development of robotics industry in China (Cheng et al., 2019; de Backer et al., 2018). In 2013, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced its “Guidance on the Promotion and Development of the Robot Industry,\" including a specific goal of developing three to five world-leading robot companies. In 2015, the well-known “Made in China $2025\"$ plan was released, and robotics was identified as one of the ten key sector areas in order to achieve digitization and intelligent manufacturing. Finally, in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), the government introduced the “New Robotic Technology Roadmap\" with large budgets for research and development on robotics.  \n\nTo implement the policy initiatives above, many local governments set up some investment capital and allocated funds to subsidize robot usage and innovation. For example, the government of Guangdong Province set up a fund of $\\$150$ billion US dollars in 2015 to encourage firms to invest in automation technology and promote robotics innovation, though it is not clear how much of the fund is spent on promoting robot production versus robot adoption (Yang, 2017). Lin (2018) reports that government subsidies accounted for up to $40\\%$ of the net profits of the four public robotics firms in 2016. These new developments made the analysis of the causal link between labor costs and robot adoption after 2012 more complicated. For this reason, we focus our analysis on the years until 2012.  \n\n## 3. Model  \n\nIn this section, we present a simple model to study firms' decisions to adopt robots.9 Consider a country with population L. Each worker supplies one unit of labor inelastically. There are two sectors, one sector with a numeraire good and the other with differentiated goods. There is perfect competition in the numeraire sector and the output from that sector is freely traded with the rest of the world. The productivity in that sector, denoted by w, pins down the wage of the home country.  \n\n### 3.1. Preferences and endowments  \n\nWe assume that there is a representative consumer in the economy, with the following preference:  \n\n$$\nU=y_{0}^{\\alpha}\\Biggl(\\Bigl[\\int_{\\omega\\in\\Omega}y(\\omega)^{\\frac{\\sigma-1}{\\sigma}}d\\omega\\Bigr]^{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}}\\Biggr)^{1-\\alpha},\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{0}$ is the numeraire good; $y(\\omega)$ is a variety of the differentiated good; $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$ governs the relative share of expenditure on the numeraire good; $\\omega$ indexes varieties in product set $\\Omega$ in the sector with differentiated goods; and $\\sigma>1$ is the elasticity of substitution between varieties.  \n\nConsumer optimization yields the following demand function for variety $\\omega$  \n\n$$\ny(\\omega)=p(\\omega)^{-\\sigma}P^{\\sigma-1}E,\n$$  \n\nwhere $p(\\omega)$ is the price of variety $\\omega;P$ is an aggregate price index; and $E$ is the aggregate expenditure on differentiated goods.  \n\n### 3.2.Firms' behavior  \n\nEach firm in the diferentiated goods sector produces a unique variety. These firms are heterogeneous in productivity. A firm with productivity $\\varphi$ produces according to  \n\n$$\ny(\\varphi)=\\varphi(l+b m),\n$$  \n\nwhere $l$ and $m$ denote the numbers of workers and robots used in production, respectively, and $b$ is a parameter governing the relative productivity between a worker and a robot. Eq. (1) implies that workers and robots are perfect substitutes in production. If workers are employed in production, the marginal cost of one unit of the differentiated variety is $\\frac{w}{\\varphi}$ , where w is the wage rate. If robots are used instead, the marginal cost is $\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{\\varphi b}$ , where $R_{r o b o t}$ is the rental rate for robots. We assume $R_{r o b o t}<\\boldsymbol{w}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{b}$ . so that the marginal cost of producing with robots is always lower than that of producing without robots. The assumption that marginal cost is lower when producing with robots follows Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020).  \n\nTo use robots in production, a firm needs to pay a fixed cost to install the robots. We assume a fixed cost of $f\\cdot\\varepsilon$ where $\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}\\in(0,\\infty)$ is a random variable given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) $G(\\varepsilon)$ .TheCDF $G(\\varepsilon)$ is independent of the distribution for $\\varphi$ and has a mean of one.  \n\nTo simplify the model, we consider the partial equilibrium where the wage for labor w and the rental rates for robots $R_{r o b o t}$ are assumed to be fixed. Conditional on the demand of consumers, each firm decides whether to adopt robots in production by comparing the profits from producing without and with using robots. Given the wages for labor and the rental rates for robots, the firm's profit without using robots is given by  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{o}(\\varphi)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\biggl(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\frac{w}{\\varphi}\\biggr)^{1-\\sigma}P^{\\sigma-1}E.\n$$  \n\nIn comparison, the profit of the same firm when using robots is given by  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{r}(\\varphi)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{b\\varphi}\\right)^{1-\\sigma}P^{\\sigma-1}E-f\\cdot\\varepsilon.\n$$  \n\nTherefore, a firm adopts robots if and only if  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\bigg(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{\\varphi}\\bigg)^{1-\\sigma}P^{\\sigma-1}E-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\bigg(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\frac{w}{\\varphi}\\bigg)^{1-\\sigma}P^{\\sigma-1}E>f\\cdot\\varepsilon.\n$$  \n\nIntuitively, because of the fixed cost associated with robot adoption, only more productive firms find it profitable to adopt them. Rearranging Eq. (2), we have  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*}=\\frac{\\Psi}{f}\\left(\\left(\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{b\\varphi}\\right)^{1-\\sigma}-\\left(\\frac{w}{\\varphi}\\right)^{1-\\sigma}\\right),\n$$  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{\\Psi=\\frac{P^{\\sigma-1}E}{\\sigma}\\Big(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\Big)^{1-\\sigma}}\\end{array}$ $\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*}(\\varphi))=G(\\varepsilon^{*}(\\varphi))$ FuF  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*}(\\varphi))}{\\partial w}=\\frac{\\Psi}{f}(\\sigma-1)g(\\varepsilon^{*}(\\varphi))w^{-\\sigma}\\varphi^{\\sigma-1}>0,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{g(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{d G(\\varepsilon)}{d\\varepsilon}}\\end{array}$ is the probabilitydensity function (PDF) of $\\varepsilon$ he folowing proposition summariestisret:  \n\nProposition 1. Conditional on fim productivity, a frm's probability of adopting robots increases with an increase in the wage.  \n\nTo study the heterogeneous effects, we take the second-order derivatives with respect to $\\varphi$ and $f$ These derivatives are givenby:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial w\\partial\\varphi}=\\bigg(g(\\varepsilon^{*})+\\frac{\\partial g(\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial\\varepsilon}\\varepsilon^{*}\\bigg)\\frac{\\Psi}{\\varphi^{2-\\sigma}f}(\\sigma-1)^{2}w^{-\\sigma},}\\ &{\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial w\\partial f}=-\\bigg(g(\\varepsilon^{*})+\\frac{\\partial g(\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial\\varepsilon}\\varepsilon^{*}\\bigg)\\frac{\\Psi}{\\varphi^{1-\\sigma}f^{2}}(\\sigma-1)w^{-\\sigma}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor convenience, we assume that $\\varepsilon$ follows a uiform disribution, so that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial g(\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial\\varphi}=0}\\end{array}$ 10 By inspection, $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial w\\partial\\varphi}>0}\\end{array}$ and ( <0. These resultsgivrise to our second proposition:  \n\nProposition 2. The effects of higher wages on the probability of adopting robot are larger for frms with higher productivity and for firms with lower fixed cost of installing robot.  \n\nTaking the model to data requires a source of exogenous variation in labor costs. We rely on the changes in the minimum wage across cities, which is closely linked to the rising labor costs in China discussed in Li et al. (2012). Theoretically, both Burdett and Mortensen (1998) and Van Den Berg (2003) show that an increase in the minimum wage will raise the wage paid by firms even when firms' wages are already above the minimum wage.  \n\nOur theoretical model admits only a single task. Once robots are adopted, firms do not use any labor inputs. To address the concern that labors and robots are not perfectly substitutable in reality, we follow Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) and extend our model into a framework with a task-based production function.11 In Appendix A, we show that our previous results regarding the effects of labor costs on the extensive margin (the probability of adopting robot) continue to hold in the model extension. On the intensive margin (defined as the number of robot quantity for robot-adopting firms), an increase in labor costs has two distinct effects. Besides the substitution effect highlighted above, there is a scale effect acting in the opposite direction. Specifically, an increase in labor costs may raise the output price and reduce output quantity, thereby decreasing the demand for robots. Therefore, the overall impact of higher labor costs on the number of robots for robotadopting firms is ambiguous. This additional theoretical prediction is tested in Table A.4 and discussed in Section 5.2.  \n\n## 4. Empirical strategy  \n\n### 4.1. Specification  \n\nOur empirical strategy builds on Dube et al. (2010), who use contiguous county pairs across state borders in the United States to identify the employment effects of minimum wages. We start by constructing a dataset of all city pairs in China that straddle provincial borders. We classify two cities as a pair if they (1) share a border and (2) belong to two different provinces. A city may belong to multiple city pairs and the resultant city-pair dataset may contain multiple replicates of the same city.12 We merge this city-pair dataset with the merged firm-level dataset (the ASIF dataset, plus the customs database). A firm-year observation will appear multiple times in the new dataset if the city of this firm belongs to multiple city pairs. To resolve the issue of duplicates in the regressions, we weight the observations with the inverse of the number of duplicates.  \n\nThis city-pair-firm dataset offers two advantages over standard approaches. First, contiguous regions have relatively similar underlying economic conditions (Dube et al., 2010). In this dataset, we can use city-pair-year fixed effects to account for time-varying and spatially correlated unobserved factors. Second, cities on provincial borders are on average more distant from the provincial government that sets the minimum wage. Minimum wages in the border cities are thus arguably more exogenous to local economic conditions. Because minimum wages in the municipalities Beijing, Tianjing, Shanghai and Chongqing are set by the municipal government, we drop pairs containing these cities from our city-pair dataset. Finally, we limit our analysis to 2004-2012. We exclude the years before 2004, a time period during which the minimum wage system was less effective and robot adoption was rare. We exclude the years after 2012 because of the changes in the Chinese robotics industry discussed in Section 2. Our final sample contains 2191421 observations from 279 city pairs and 210 unique cities. Fig. 1 illustrates the sample of cities covered by our city-pair dataset.  \n\nWe consider the following specification for our empirical investigation  \n\n$$\nY_{i,t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\ln(\\mathrm{mwage}_{c,t-1})+\\beta_{2}Z_{c,t-1}+\\varphi_{i}+\\varphi_{p,t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y_{i,t}$ is a measure of robot adoption for $\\tan i$ in year t; $\\mathtt{m w a g e}_{c,t-1}$ is the minimum wage in city $c$ in year $t-1$ , and $\\varphi_{p,t}$ are the fixed effect for city pair $p$ in year t. We lag the local minimum wage and the city control $Z_{c,t-1}$ by one year, on the grounds that firms may take time to respond to changes in the minimum wage and to reduce endogeneity concerns. The city-pair-year fixed effects $\\varphi_{p,t}$ in Eq. (3) account for the city-pair-specific time-varying shocks. The vector of city controls $Z_{c,t-1}$ include the city population, the city gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the price level and the unemployment rate. By including $\\varphi_{p,t}$ , we are effectively comparing firms' robot adoption behaviors to those in the bordering city within the same city pair. We cluster the standard errors at the city level.13  \n\nWhile the research design based on city pairs helps to address endogeneity concerns, a caveat on the interpretation of the estimation results should be noted. The identification strategy above hinges on comparisons of the outcome variable within city pairs. However, an increase in the minimum wage in a city could have spillover effects on the paired city, for example through the migration of workers. Our estimation strategy relates relative changes in the minimum wage within a city pair to the overall differences in robot adoption between the two cities. To the extent spillover effects within city pairs exist, they are included in the estimated effects. However, recent research shows that frictions in inter-province migration in China are much larger than those in intra-province migrations (Fan, 2019; Tombe and Zhu, 2019). Since each city pair in our sample straddles a provincial border, the scope for spillovers through migration is more limited in our setting.  \n\n![](images/4a57c829a481922998164dbba9d0fa3ddb91f88152e964164193c07d5948e5d9.jpg)  \nFig. 1. Neighboring city pairs across provincial borders. Notes: Cities included in our empirical analysis are colored in dark. Provincial borders are colorer in white. We consider two cities to be a pair if they share a border and belong to two different provinces. The municipalities Beijing, Tianjing, Shangha and Chongqing are not included (see the text for an explanation).  \n\n### 4.2.Data  \n\nOur empirical analysis relies on a number of data sources containing rich information, both at the firm level and at the prefecture-city level. To obtain the firm-level variables, such as total factor productivity (TFP) and robot adoption behavior, we use the Chinese Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) and the transaction-level custom database provided by the Chinese General Administration of Customs (CGAS). These two datasets have been widely used in combination in various studies of the Chinese economy such as Yu (2015) and Fan et al. (2018a). The ASIF surveys are conducted by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and contain firm-level information, including firm identification (e.g., company name and location), ownership structure, employment, capital stock, gross output, value added and various financial variables. These surveys cover all large and medium-sized non-SOEs with annual sales above 5 million RMB before 2011 (approximately 770 thousand USD in 2007) and above 20 million RMB after 2011 (approximately 3.1 million USD in 2011). Until 2007, the surveys also covered SOEs with annual sales below the threshold of 5 million RMB.14 Although the ASIF data are one of the most reliable sources for studying Chinese firms, some concerns regarding data quality should be noted (Brandt et al., 2014). For 2010 in particular, the number of firms in the ASIF data is substantially smaller than those in adjacent years and no explanation has been offered by the Chinese NBs. For this reason we exclude 2010 from our firm-level analysis.  \n\n![](images/44143713b710e478faf6a42544bb5729db0649fdc49d8132191f061e36dab7b1.jpg)  \nFig. 2. Adoption of Robots in China.  \n\nThe customs database covers the universe of all Chinese exports and imports from 2001 to 2012 at the HS 8-digit level. For each trade transaction, the customs database records detailed information including import and export values, quantities, product information, the source and the destination countries, firms' contact information, and the customs regime.15 We identify imports of industrial robots by firms in the customs database using the HS6 code for industrial robots.16 We then match the ASIF data with the customs database using the procedure in Fan et al. (2015).  \n\nWe supplement the firm-level information with city-level variables. Data on minimum wages are manually collected from local government websites, statistical bulletins, and other public statistics sources on the Internet and have been used in Fan et al. (2018b). Finally, data on other city-level socioeconomic characteristics come from the commercial data provider CEIC.  \n\n### 4.3. Measuring robot adoption  \n\nA crucial ingredient of our analysis is a disaggregate measure of robot adoption at the firm level. To construct this measure, we first identify the imports of robots in the customs database (see footnote 16). Fig. 2 plots the total number of imported robots based on the customs database from 2001 to 2012. The quantity of robot imports increased at an annual rateof $23\\%$ . from 3.7 thousand units in 2001 to 36.5 thousand units in 2012. Fig. 2 also plots the total number of robot sales from the IFR, which calculates annual robot shipments by country based on statistics provided by national robot associations and robot suppliers worldwide. Two patterns emerge from this figure. First, the quantity of robot sales in the customs database is higher than that in the IFR data throughout the period. One potential explanation is that the IFR data might be based on a narrower definition of industrial robots.17 Another potential explanation is that the robot suppliers and national robot associations under-report their sales data to the IFR for strategic reasons. The second pattern from Fig. 2 is that the numbers from the customs database closely track their IFR counterparts. This helps to validate our use of the customs-based measure for the empirical analysis.  \n\nAfter merging the customs database and the ASIF dataset, we compute the operational stock of robots for each firm (denotedby $\\scriptstyle Q_{r o b o t s}.$ 0 in the ASIF as the cumulative number of imported industrial robots.18 This allows us to estimate the effects of minimum wages on the overall quantity of robots. We exclude processing-trade imports of robots in the calculation for our baseline analysis. However, our results are robust if we include them in the calculation. Finally, we define a firm as having adopted robots if its operational stock is greater than zero. The resulting dummy variable allows us to examine the effects of minimum wages on whether a firm adopts any robots.  \n\nTable 1 Summary statistics.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>No. obs.</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std. dev.</td><td>Median</td></tr><tr><td>City-levelvariables</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Monthly minimum wage (yuan)</td><td>1625</td><td>497.2</td><td>182.2</td><td>460</td></tr><tr><td>Citypopulation(thousands)</td><td>1625</td><td>3921.7</td><td>2329.4</td><td>3460</td></tr><tr><td>City GDPper capita(yuan)</td><td>1625</td><td>17861.9</td><td>16273.7</td><td>12786</td></tr><tr><td>Citypricelevel</td><td>1625</td><td>2.206</td><td>0.907</td><td>1.962</td></tr><tr><td>Unemploymentrate</td><td>1625</td><td>0.073</td><td>0.053</td><td>0.067</td></tr><tr><td>Firm-levelvariables</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Having adopted robots</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>0.001</td><td>0.035</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Robotquantity</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>0.017</td><td>2.829</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>SOE firm</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>0.115</td><td>0.319</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Log firm TFP</td><td>1,341,886</td><td>3.698</td><td>0.998</td><td>3.702</td></tr><tr><td>Skillintensity</td><td>1,748,296</td><td>0.105</td><td>0.049</td><td>0.105</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nOur measure of robot adoption offers two distinct advantages over the alternatives. First, The customs database is administrative in nature, in the sense that presumably a customs official has to verify the machinery in question. In contrast, firm-level surveys (that are not the same as the AsIF surveys) such as those used in Cheng et al. (2019), Koch et al., 2019 and Bessen et al., 2019 rely to some extent on the judgement of the questionaire-taker on what counts as a robot. Second, our dataset covers a longer time period with a wider geographic coverage compared to other datasets with information on firms' robot adoptionbehavior.  \n\nNevertheless, there are some limitations of using the customs database to measure robot adoption. First, the merging of custom database and the AsIF dataset is not perfect. In particular, smaller firms below a revenue threshold are not included in the ASIF and the matching procedure are able to link about only $43\\%$ of the nonprocessing robot-importing firms $52\\%$ if we exclude trade intermediaries) in the customs data to ASIF firm data.19 Those smaller firms are not included in our firm-level analysis. Second, some firms in the ASIF data may be importing robots indirectly with the help of trade intermediaries. This would result in underestimating robot adoption behavior for these firms. Finally, while industrial robots produced within China were relatively uncommon before 2013, to the extent they do exist, they are not included in our robot measure. We discuss the robustness of our results with respect to the robot adoption measure in Section 7.  \n\nTable 1 presents the summary statistics of the key variables used in our analysis. As Table 1 shows, robot adoption is relatively rare in China over the sample period, with only $0.12\\%$ of firms having adopted any robots. Table A.1 reports the average robot adoption probability and robot quantity by SOE status, by firm TFP, by region and by industry skill intensity.  \n\n## 5. Empirical results  \n\n### 5.1. Baseline results  \n\nTable 2 presents the estimation results based on Eq. (3). Panel A reports results when the dependent variable is whether a firm has adopted robots. In column (1), besides the variable log minimum wage, we include only firm fixed effects and year fixed effects. The coefficient on the log minimum wage is -0.00054 with a standard error of 0.o0044. We introduce city-pair-year fixed effects and a vector of city controls in columns (2) and (3), respectively. According to column (3), a $10\\%$ increase in the local minimum wage raises a firm's probability of adopting robots by 0.0074 percentage point, a small number even after accounting for the fact that only $0.12\\%$ of firms adopt any robots in the full sample. Moreover, the point estimate is not statistically significant.  \n\nPanel B of Table 2 presents results when the dependent variable is log robot quantity (more precisely, $\\log(1+Q_{r o b o t s}))$ where the quantity $Q_{r o b o t s}$ is the cumulative number of robots imported by the firm. According to our preferred estimates in column (3), an increase in the minimum wage has no significant effect on the quantity of robots adopted by firms.  \n\n### 5.2. Effects over time  \n\nAccording to the results in Table 2, although the effects of minimum wages on robot adoption are positive, the coefficients are quite small and statistically insignificant. However, because of many changes in the Chinese labor market and in the evolution of robotics technology over the sample period, one might expect the effects of minimum wages on robot adoption to vary over time. First, as described by Ford (2015), crucial breakthroughs in related technology have made robots much more affordable. Consistent with this view, data from the 2014 IFR show that the total sales of robots worldwide increase at a faster rate starting in 2009 compared with previous years. Second, the global financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent policy response by the government, including a large fiscal stimulus package, could have altered firms' incentive to invest in robots (Fardoust et al., 2012). Through the lens of the model, these two changes can be thought of as a reduction in the fixed cost of robot adoption. According to Proposition 2 in Section 3, we would expect the effects of labor costs on robot adoption to be stronger for the later period. Third and finally, as discussed in Section 2.1, the Labor Contract Law introduced in 2008 significantly increased firms' burdens of complying with labor regulations. In view of these factors, we analyze the effects separately for 2004-2007 and 2008-2012 by including relevant interaction terms.  \n\nTable2 Effects of minimum wages on robot adoption.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td>A.Adoptionprobability</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Logminwage</td><td>-0.00054</td><td>0.00092</td><td>0.00074</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>(0.00044) 0.850</td><td>(0.00079) 0.851</td><td>(0.00065) 0.851</td></tr><tr><td>B.Logrobotquantity</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Log min wage</td><td>-0.00084</td><td>0.00201</td><td>0.00161</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00077)</td><td>(0.00154)</td><td>(0.00127)</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.874</td><td>0.875</td><td>0.875</td></tr><tr><td>Firm FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Year FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City-pair-yearFE</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City controls</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>2,191,421</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Standard errors, which are in parentheses, are clustered by city. $^{***}\\mathfrak{p}<0.01$ $^{**}{\\mathfrak{p}}<0.05$ $\\mathsf{P}<0.1\\$  \n\nTable3 Effects of minimum wages over time.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td>A.Adoptionprobability</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Logminwagex2004-2007</td><td>-0.00056 (0.00054)</td><td>0.00026 (0.00063)</td><td>0.00011 (0.00056)</td></tr><tr><td>Logminwagex2008-2012</td><td>0.00449 (0.00379)</td><td>0.01156** (0.00553)</td><td>0.01130** (0.00535)</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.850</td><td>0.851</td><td>0.851</td></tr><tr><td>B.Logrobotquantity</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Logmin wagex2004-2007</td><td>-0.00086 (0.00095)</td><td>0.00077 (0.00120)</td><td>0.00043 (0.00107)</td></tr><tr><td>Logmin wagex2008-2012</td><td>0.00842 (0.00723)</td><td>0.02179** (0.01057)</td><td>0.02129** (0.01017)</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.874</td><td>0.875</td><td>0.875</td></tr><tr><td>Firm FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Year FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City-pair-year FE</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City controls</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>2,191,421</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Standard errors, which are in parentheses, are clustered by city. $^{***}\\mathfrak{p}<0.01$ $^{**}{\\mathfrak{p}}<0.05$ $\\mathsf{P}<0.1\\$  \n\nTable 3 present results when we include interactions between log minimum wage, and the dummy variables for 2004- 2007 and 2008-2012. Panel A presents results when the dependent variable is whether a firm has adopted robots. As in the previous table, we include only firm fixed effects and year fixed effects in column (1) and introduce city-pair-year fixed effects and city controls in columns (2) and (3), respectively. Across the different specifications, we do not find any effects for 2004-2007. For 2008-2012, the coefficient on log minimum wage is 0.00449 in column (1) and 0.01156 in column (2). The differences between columns (1) and (2) demonstrate the importance of limiting the comparison of robot adoption to firms from neighboring city pairs with city-pair-year fixed effects. Column (3) presents our preferred estimates with city controls. The coefficient on log minimum wage for the years for 2008-2012 is 0.011, with a standard error of 0.0054. This is statistically significant at $5\\%$ . According to this point estimate, a $10\\%$ increase in the minimum wage raise a firm's probability of adopting robots by 0.11 percentage points, relative to firms in the other cities. Because the share of firms that adopted robots is only $0.12\\%$ over the full sample period and $0.19\\%$ for the years after 2008, the magnitude of this effect is large.20  \n\nPanel B of Table 3 presents results on robot quantity. According to the estimates in Column (3), a $10\\%$ increase inthe minimum wage leads to an $0.213\\%$ increase in the number of robots for the average firm. A caveat is that, because of the large number of zero values in the variable $Q_{r o b o t s}$ . comparisons between zero-value firms and non-zero-value firms play an important role in identifying the coefficients in Panel B.  \n\nGiven the rapid pace of changes in China in recent decades, any partition of the sample period into two sub-periods is not perfect. In Table A.3, we include a full set of interaction terms between log minimum wage and year dummies to study the full time dynamics of the effects of minimum wages on robot adoption. Consistent with Table 3, we find that the effects to larger and statistically more significant for the years after 2007. Additionally, the coefficients corresponding to the years 2008 and 2009 are larger than those for later years. Kopytov et al. (2018) construct a model, in which the adoption of new technologies by firms is concentrated in downturns due to low opportunity costs, to account for the acceleration of skillbiased technological change during the Great Recession. While the Great Recession is relatively mild in China compared to other countries, GDP growth slowed down from an annual rate of $14.2\\%$ in 2007to $9.7\\%$ in 2008 and $9.4\\%$ in 2009.A greater number of firms may decide to upgrade their technology by adopting robots during the downturns, because the opportunity cost associated with adjustment costs due to production disruption would be lower.  \n\nBy analyzing the effects on whether a firm chooses to adopt any robots, Panel A of both Tables 2 and 3 speaks to the extensive margin of robot adoption. In contrast, by analyzing the effects on robot quantity for all firms, Panel B of both tables speaks to the overall effects, which also include the intensive margin where firms that already adopted robots choose to increase their quantity of robots. The large number of zero values in the variable $Q_{r o b o t s}$ suggests that the patterns of robot adoption are primarily driven by the first-time robot adopters. In other words, the extensive margin plays a more important role than the intensive margin. To examine the intensive margin more carefully, we limit the sample to only firms that have ever adopted robots in Table A.4. As Table A.4 shows, we do not find any significant effects of minimum wages on robot adoption on the intensive margin. This is consistent with the model extension in Appendix A which predicts that higher labor costs have ambiguous effects on the intensive margin due to the existence of scale effects.  \n\n## 6. Heterogeneous effects  \n\nWe analyze the heterogeneous effects of minimum wages on robot adoption in this section. We start by testing Proposition 2, which states that the effects of minimum wages on robot adoption should be larger for firms with higher TFP. We then study the effects of minimum wages on robot adoption along three additional dimensions: location, SOE status, and industry skill intensity.  \n\n### 6.1. Effects of minimum wage by initial TFP  \n\nAccording to Proposition 2, the effects of higher minimum wages on robot adoption should be larger for firms with higher TFP. To test the proposition, we introduce an interaction term between log minimum wage and TFP to Eq. (3). Because the effects on robot adoption are concentrated on the years after 2008, as shown by our results in Table 3, it is interesting to examine the interaction between log minimum wage and TFP for 2004-2007 and 2008-2012 separately. To this end, we introduce triple interaction terms of log minimum wage, TFP, and sub-period dummies.21  \n\nBecause firms' contemporary TFP might be influenced by its robot adoption behavior, we use the initial TFP (i.e., the TFP when a firm appears in our dataset for the first time) instead. We compute TFP following Olley and Pakes (1996) and Ackerberg et al. (2015). Because the ASIF data do not have information on either intermediate goods or value added for the years after 2007, we cannot compute initial TFP for firms entering the dataset after 2007. Consequently, the sample size for the analysis in this subsection is reduced relative to the baseline.  \n\nTable 4 presents the results from our analysis of the heterogeneous effects by initial TFP. As column (1) shows, for the full sample period, the coefficient on the interaction term of interest is 0.00052 and significant at the $5\\%$ level.According to the estimates in column (1), a $10\\%$ increase in the minimum wage raises the probability of a firm adopting robots by 0.018 percentage points for a firm at the 90th percentile of the TFP distribution, compared to 0.005 percentage point for a firm at the 10th percentile. Column (2) of Table 4 examines the interaction between log minimum wage and TFP for 2004-2007 and 2008-2012 separately. Consistent with the finding in Table 3 that minimum wages have no effects on robot adoption for 2004-2007, the coefficient on the corresponding triple interaction term in column (2) is very close to zero. Put differently, before 2007, the effects of minimum wages on robot adoption are negligible, regardless of whether firms have high or low TFP. Through the lens of the model, the period before 2007 corresponds to the case in which the fixed cost of robot adoption is so high such that an increase in labor costs have little effect on robot adoption regardless of the level of TFP.  \n\nBy comparison, the coefficient on the corresponding triple interaction term for 2008-2012 is 0.00076, with a $p$ -Valule of 0.11.2 According to the estimates, for 2008-2012, a $10\\%$ increase in the minimum wage raises the probability of robot adoption by as much as 0.16 percentage points for a firm at the 90th percentile of the TFP distribution, compared to 0.14 percentage points for a firm at the 1oth percentile.  \n\nTable 4 Effects of minimum wages by initial TFP.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) (2) Adoptionprobability</td><td>(3) Log robot quantity</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log min wage</td><td colspan=\"2\">-0.00082</td><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td>(0.00082)</td><td></td><td>-0.00251 (0.00167)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log min wagexTFP</td><td>0.00052**</td><td></td><td>0.00133***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(0.00024)</td><td></td><td>(0.00050)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Log min wagex2004-2007</td><td></td><td>0.00112</td><td></td><td>-0.00022</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Logminwagex2008-2012</td><td></td><td>(0.00155)</td><td></td><td>(0.00243)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.01240**</td><td></td><td>0.02398**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">TFP×2008-2012</td><td></td><td>(0.00603)</td><td></td><td>(0.01109)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.00457</td><td></td><td>-0.00373</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log min wagexTFPx2004-2007</td><td></td><td>(0.00334)</td><td></td><td>(0.00521)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.00001</td><td></td><td>0.00073</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log min wagexTFPx2008-2012</td><td></td><td>(0.00030)</td><td></td><td>(0.00046)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.00076</td><td></td><td>0.00135*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">R-squared</td><td></td><td>(0.00047)</td><td></td><td>(0.00081)</td></tr><tr><td>0.720</td><td>0.720</td><td>0.746</td><td>0.747</td></tr><tr><td>Firm FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City-pair-year FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City controls</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1,341,886</td><td>1,341,886</td><td>1,341,886</td><td>1,341,886</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Standard errors, which are in parentheses, are clustered by city. $^{***}\\mathbb{P}<0.01$ $^{**}{\\mathfrak{p}}<0.05$ ${\\mathfrak{p}}<0.1.$  \n\nThe results on robot quantity, reported in columns (3) and (4), are similar to those in columns (1) and (2), the main difference being that the coefficient on the triple interaction term for 2008-2012 is statistically significant at the $10\\%$ level. In summary, in line with Proposition 2, we find the positive effects of minimum wages on robot adoption to be larger for moreproductivefirms.  \n\nBecause of missing values for TFP, the sample size in Table 4 is smaller than in the baseline regressions in Table 2. To mitigate concerns about sample attrition, we use firm size, as measured by total employment, as a proxy for firm TFP, because there is a one-to-one mapping between TFP and employment size through the lens of the model. We examine the effects by firm size in Table A.5. We find the effects of minimum wages to be stronger for larger firms. Therefore, the results in Table A.5 are consistent with those in Table 4. The difference is that employment size is directly observed while firm TFP has to be estimated from the data using procedures such as Olley and Pakes (1996).  \n\n### 6.2. Effects by region  \n\nThe coastal region accounts for about $52\\%$ of the firms in the ASIF data, whereas the inland region, which covers a much greater geographic area, accounts for the rest.23 The effects of minimum wages on robot adoption may be stronger for firms from the coastal region for two reasons. First, the theoretical model suggests the effects of rising labor costs on robot adoption to be larger for more productive firms. The data show that the more productive firms are indeed clustered in the coastal region. Second, holding other things constant, due to the high levels, minimum wages are more likely to be binding on firms in the coastal region and to have an impact on robot adoption decisions.  \n\nSimilar to our analysis on the effects by firm productivity in Section 6.1, we introduce an interaction term between log minimum wage and an dummy variable for the coastal region to Eq. (3). To analyze the effects by sub-period, we further introduce triple interaction terms of log minimum wage, the coastal region dummy, and period dummies. Table 5 presents the results. According to Columns (1) and (3), an increase in labor costs has no effects at all for firms located in the inland region, over the full sample period. In contrast, the coefficients on the interaction terms with the coastal region dummy are positive and statistically significant, indicating that an increase in labor costs has a much larger effect on firms from the coastal region and the differences are statistically significant. Columns (2) and (4) show that differences between coastal and inland regions mainly driven by the 2008-2012. In summary, we find the positive effects of minimum wages on robot adoption to apply to the coastal region, but not to the inland region.  \n\n### 6.3.Effects by SOE status  \n\nAs documented by Berkowitz et al. (2017), SOE in China are often required to pursue noneconomic objective by hiring excess labor. Consequently, SOEs are systematically diferent from private firms. Furthermore, minimum wages are less likely to be binding for SOEs as the wages at these firms are higher than those at non-sOEs on average. Therefore, an increase in the minimum wage may have smaller effects on the adoption of robots by SoEs. We examine the heterogeneous effects by firms' SOE status in Table 6. Columns (1) and (3) show that the effects of minimum wages on robot adoption, in terms of both probability and quantity, are much smaller for SOE firms than for private firms. The difference, as indicated by the coefficient on the interaction term, is statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. Columns (2) and (4) examine these heterogeneous effects separately for 2004-2007 and 2008-2012. According to the estimates, for 2004-2007, an increase in the minimum wage has no effects on robot adoption, in terms of probability or quantity, for either type of firms. For 2008-2012, a $10\\%$ increase in the minimum wage raises the probability of robot adoption of 0.117 percentage and the quantity of robots by $0.220\\%$ for non-SOEs. These effects are significant at the $5\\%$ level. The corresponding numbers for SOEs are smaller in magnitude at 0.076 percentage points and $0.146\\%$ respectively. Therefore, robot adoption by SOEs is less sensitive to increases in the minimum wage. This is consistent with the finding in Fan et al. (2018b) that the outward FDI decisions of SOEs are unresponsive to changes in the minimum wage.  \n\nTable5 Effects of minimum wages by region.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) (2) Adoption probability</td><td>(3)</td><td>Log robot quantity</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>Log min wage</td><td colspan=\"2\">-0.0000</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.0002</td></tr><tr><td>Log min wagex Coastal</td><td>(0.0005) 0.0020**</td><td></td><td>(0.0009) 0.0037**</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0009)</td><td></td><td>(0.0014)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log min wage×2004-2007</td><td></td><td>0.0005</td><td></td><td>0.0010</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0005) 0.0038*</td><td></td><td>(0.0009)</td></tr><tr><td>Log min wage×2008-2012</td><td></td><td>(0.0020)</td><td></td><td>0.0076** (0.0038)</td></tr><tr><td>Coastalx2008-2012</td><td></td><td>-0.0853** (0.0329)</td><td></td><td>-0.1569**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log min wage× Coastal× 2004-2007</td><td></td><td>0.0011</td><td></td><td>(0.0627)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0008)</td><td></td><td>0.0023 (0.0015)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log min wage × Coastal× 2008-2012</td><td></td><td>0.0144***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0054)</td><td></td><td>0.0269** (0.0104)</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.851</td><td>0.851</td><td>0.875</td><td>0.875</td></tr><tr><td>Firm FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City-pair-year FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City controls</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>2,191,421</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Standard errors, which are in parentheses, are clustered by city. $^{***}\\mathbb{P}<0.01$ $^{**}{\\mathfrak{p}}<0.05$ ${\\mathfrak{p}}<0.1.$  \n\nTable6 Effects of minimum wages by SOE status.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) (2) Adoptionprobability</td><td>(3) Log robot quantity</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>log minimumwage</td><td>0.00093</td><td>0.00199</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>logminwagexSOE</td><td>(0.00070) -0.00113**</td><td>(0.00137)</td><td>-0.00226**</td></tr><tr><td>logminwagex2004-2007</td><td>(0.00057)</td><td>(0.00106) 0.00020</td><td>0.00065</td></tr><tr><td>logminwagex2008-2012</td><td></td><td>(0.00059) 0.01167**</td><td>(0.00113) 0.02199**</td></tr><tr><td>SOEx2008-2012</td><td></td><td>(0.00547)</td><td>(0.01042)</td></tr><tr><td>logminwagexS0Ex2004-2007</td><td></td><td>0.02311* (0.01294)</td><td>0.03952 (0.02438)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>-0.00039 (0.00041)</td><td>-0.00108 (0.00076)</td></tr><tr><td>logmin wagexS0Ex2008-2012</td><td></td><td>-0.00411* (0.00220)</td><td>-0.00742* (0.00416)</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.851 0.851</td><td>0.875</td><td>0.875</td></tr><tr><td>Firm FE</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City-pair-year FE</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City controls</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>2,191,421 2,191,421</td><td>2,191,421</td><td>2,191,421</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Standard errors, which are in parentheses, are clustered by city. $^{***}\\mathbb{P}<0.01$ $^{**}{\\mathfrak{p}}<0.05$ $\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{*}\\mathbf{p}~<~0.1$  \n\n### 6.4. Effects by industry  \n\nThe adoption of robots is not uniform across industries. To examine this heterogeneity in details, we conduct our analysis separately for selected 2-digit industries based on the China Industry Classification (CIC). In our data, the seven 2-digit industries with the highest probability of robot adoption accounts for only $18.3\\%$ of the firms in our data and $84.3\\%$ of the robot-adopting firms over 2004-2012. We repeat our analysis in Section 5 for each of the seven industries and a subsample combining all other industries.  \n\nTable7 Effects of minimum wages for selected industries.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Industry description</td><td>(1) Communication, computers & electronicequip.</td><td>(2) Instruments, meters,cultural& clerical machinery</td><td>(3) Transportation equipment</td><td>(4) Special purpose equipment</td><td>(5) Plastic products</td><td>(6) Rubber products</td><td>(7) Electric machinery & equipment</td><td>(8) others</td></tr><tr><td>A.Adoptionprobability</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Log min wagex2004-2007</td><td>-0.00181 (0.01815)</td><td>0.00881</td><td>0.00182</td><td>0.00181</td><td>0.00495</td><td>0.00100</td><td>0.00202</td><td>-0.00008</td></tr><tr><td>Logminwagex2008-2012</td><td>0.06997**</td><td>(0.00554) 0.06852***</td><td>(0.00346) 0.02037</td><td>(0.00146) 0.02061**</td><td>(0.00395) 0.05540**</td><td>(0.00090) 0.01985*</td><td>(0.00248) 0.01738***</td><td>(0.00008) 0.00120</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.03253)</td><td>(0.01934)</td><td>(0.01447)</td><td>(0.00806)</td><td>(0.02469)</td><td>(0.01118)</td><td>(0.00507)</td><td>(0.00085)</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.874</td><td>0.898</td><td>0.861</td><td>0.872</td><td>0.833</td><td>0.923</td><td>0.830</td><td>0.865</td></tr><tr><td>B.Logrobot quantity Log min wagex2004-2007</td><td>0.01604</td><td>0.01304*</td><td>-0.00008</td><td>0.00189</td><td>0.01134</td><td>0.00162</td><td>0.00389</td><td>-0.00008</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.03249)</td><td>(0.00706)</td><td>(0.00693)</td><td>(0.00274)</td><td>(0.00832)</td><td>(0.00146)</td><td>(0.00493)</td><td>(0.00012)</td></tr><tr><td>Logminwagex2008-2012</td><td>0.16723***</td><td>0.07440***</td><td>0.03686</td><td>0.04172**</td><td>0.10606**</td><td>0.03195*</td><td>0.02729**</td><td>0.00173</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>(0.06220) 0.879</td><td>(0.02105) 0.959</td><td>(0.02552) 0.880</td><td>(0.01654) 0.893</td><td>(0.04734) 0.884</td><td>(0.01799)</td><td>(0.01061)</td><td>(0.00112)</td></tr><tr><td>Firm FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.937</td><td>0.816</td><td>0.908</td></tr><tr><td>City-pair-year FE</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City controls</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>46,262</td><td>20,674</td><td>74,263</td><td>72,896</td><td>69,269</td><td>19,503</td><td>92,747</td><td>Yes 1,792,193</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes:The 2-digit indstre are arranged in desending orderof average robot adoption probabilityThe industry desription correponding to the 2-digit industry codes is as follows: 40, communication equpment, computers, and other electronic equipment; 41, instruments, meters, cultural, and clrical machinery; 37, transportation equipment; 36, special purpose equipment; 30, plastic products; 29, rubber products; 39, electric machinery and equipment.

Throughout the table, we do not find any effects over 2004-2007. Consider Panel A, column (1), which corresponds to the \"communication equipment, computers, and other electronic equipment\" industry. This industry has the highest probability of robot adoption in our data, with an average probability of $2.0\\%$ The coefficient on log minimum wage over 2008-2012 is 0.0700, implying a 0.700 percentage point increase in the probability of robot adoption for a $10\\%$ increase in the minimum wage. The corresponding coefficients in columns (2)-(7) in Panel A of Table 7 range from 0.0174 in column (7) to 0.0685 in column (2). These coeficients in columns (2)-(7) are statistically significant atthe $10\\%$ level or higher, with the exception of column (3). Finally, column (8) reports results for firms from the other industries. For these firms, the average probability of robot adoption is much lower at $0.0230\\%$ Consequently, the coefficient on log minimum wage over 2008-2012 for these firms is also smaller at 0.00120, with a standard error of 0.00o85. In summary, the positive effects of minimum wages on robot adoption continue to hold when we study selected industries in isolation. Furthermore, the magnitudes of these effects vary considerably across industries.  \n\nWe explore the heterogeneous effects across industry by relating them to industry characteristics. We focus on the skill intensity of an industry, as measured by the share of workers with at least a four-year college education.24 We conduct the analysis at the 4-digit industry level. The data on skill intensity are calculated from the 2004 Firm Census in China by Che and Zhang (2018). According to the data, the most skill-intensive 4-digit CIC industry is petrochemical refineries, whereas the least skill-intensive is leathers manufacturing.  \n\nColumns (1) and (3) of Table 8 present the overall effects on adoption probability and quantity over the sample period. We find the coeficient on the interaction between log minimum wage and the skill intensity measure to be positive and statistically significant. A potential explanation is that recent advances in robotics technology are especially applicable to several skill-intensive industries, such as the manufacturing of precision instruments and electronics. In columns (2) and (4) we introduce triple interactions-of log minimum wage, skill intensity, and time dummies-to analyze the heterogeneous effects for 2004-2007 and 2008-2012 separately. The results show that the effects of minimum wages on firms' robot adoption are stronger for firms in more skill-intensive sectors for 2008-2012.  \n\nOne concern about the results in Table 8 is that the skill-labor intensity of an industry could be influenced by robot adoption. In Table A.6, we use data on skill intensity from the United States in 1980 (available from Ciccone and Papaioannou, 2009) to replace the measure from China to address the endogeneity concerns. The correlation in industry-level skill intensity between this measure and that for China in 2004 is 0.7471. As Table A.6 show, our results are robust to the alternative measure of industry-level skill intensity.  \n\nTable 8 Effects of minimum wages by skill intensity.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) (2) Adoption probability</td><td>(3) Log robot quantity</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>Log min wage</td><td>0.0002</td><td>0.0006</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Log min wage x Skill</td><td>(0.0003) 0.0014**</td><td>(0.0006) 0.0018**</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0007)</td><td>(0.0009)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Log min wage×2004-2007</td><td></td><td>0.0001 (0.0003)</td><td>0.0003 (0.0006)</td></tr><tr><td>Log min wage×2008-2012</td><td></td><td>0.0031*</td><td>0.0052*</td></tr><tr><td>Skillx2008-2012</td><td></td><td>(0.0016) -0.1658</td><td>(0.0030) -0.3091</td></tr><tr><td>Log min wage× Skill× 2004-2007</td><td></td><td>(0.1031)</td><td>(0.2098)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0.0001 (0.0005)</td><td>-0.0005 (0.0011)</td></tr><tr><td>Log min wage × Skill× 2008-2012</td><td>0.0273*</td><td></td><td>0.0501</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0165)</td><td></td><td>(0.0332)</td></tr><tr><td>R-sq</td><td>0.859 0.860</td><td>0.884</td><td>0.884</td></tr><tr><td>Firm FE</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>City-pair-year FE</td><td>Yes Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City controls</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1,748,296 1,748,296</td><td>1,748,296</td><td>1,748,296</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Standard errors, which are in parentheses, are clustered by city. $^{***}\\mathbb{P}<0.01$ $^{**}{\\mathfrak{p}}<0.05$ ${\\mathfrak{p}}<0.1.$  \n\nTo summarize this section, we find the effects of minimum wages on robot adoption to be stronger for more productive frms, those located in the coastal region, those with private ownership, and those in more skill-intensive industries.  \n\n## 7. Robustness  \n\nWe discuss several potential concerns regarding our empirical approach in this section. In our baseline results, we include a number of control variables including city population, city GDP per capita, city unemployment and city price level. To address concerns regarding other potential confounding factors, we add additional control variables to the regressions. We include a measure of city-level trade exposure, defined as the sum of import and export values as a ratio of city GDP. To account for changes in stock of other capitals, we control for city-level fixed capital investment (in log). The preceding two variables are both obtained from the CEIC database. To account for demographic characteristics, we include as control variables the female share of the population aged between 15 and 60 and the share of workers with university degree or higher, both measured at the provincial level and available from provincial statistical yearbooks. As Table A.7 in the appendix shows, the main coefficients of interest are not substantively changed from our baseline regressions. Therefore, our results are not likely to be driven by these factors.  \n\nAnother concern is that some firms in the ASIF data may be indirectly importing robots with the help of trade intermediaries. This would result in underestimating robot adoption behavior for these firms. To address this issue, we first identify trade intermediaries in the custom database. Following Ahn et al. (2011) and Yu (2015), we identify intermediary firms based on Chinese characters with the meaning of “importer\", “exporter\", or “trading\" in the firm's name. Fig. A1 shows that the share of robots imported by trade intermediaries is less than $25\\%$ throughout 2004-2012. Further, importing robots through trade intermediaries should be less of a concern for the medium and large firms in the ASIF dataset, because firms importing through trade intermediaries tend to be smaller in size (Ahn et al., 2011).  \n\nA further concern is that, even putting aside the role of trade intermediaries, our baseline results are based on only a subset of the remaining robot imports in the customs database, as a result of the imperfect matching procedure between the customs data and the ASIF data. To address concerns about the role of firms outside the ASIF, we construct a city panel of robot imports using only the customs database. For each year, we aggregate the robot imports to the city level, based on the location of the importing firm. We exclude imports by trade intermediaries but include all other firms, both inside and outside the ASIF. We then study the effects of minimum wages on the total quantity of adopted robots in a panel of cities. We conduct the analysis on the sample of city pairs, with the following specification:  \n\n$$\n\\ln(r o b o t_{c,t})=\\gamma_{0}+\\gamma_{1}\\ln(\\mathrm{mwage}_{c,t-1})+\\gamma_{2}Z_{c,t-1}+\\omega_{c}+\\omega_{p,t}+\\varepsilon_{c,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $r o b o t_{c,t}$ is the cumulative number of robots in city $c$ in year $t$ and $\\omega_{c}$ and $\\omega_{p,t}$ are city and city-pair-year fixed effects, respectively.  \n\nTable 9 presents the results. Columns (1) and (2) present the overall effects on robot adoption over 2004-2012 from regressions without and with city controls, respectively. For both columns, the coefficient on log minimum wage is about 0.22, but is statistically insignificant. Columns (3) and (4) report the effects by period. According to our preferred estimates in column (4), for 2008-2012, a $10\\%$ increase in the minimum wage in a city raises the quantity of robots by about $8.5\\%$ relative to other cities. This large effect on robot quantity from city-level regressions contrasts with that from our firm-level regressions. Because many firms in the data have not adopted any robots, the coefficients from our firm-level regressions in Tables 2-3 are dominated by comparisons between zero-value firms and non-zero-value firms. Table 9, however, shows that increases in the minimum wage have large and positive effects on the adoption of robots in a city, especially for 2008-2012.  \n\nTable 9 Results from city-level regressions.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">Logcityrobotquantity</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>Log min wage</td><td>0.223</td><td>0.220</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log min wagex2004-2007</td><td>(0.257)</td><td>(0.259)</td><td>-0.216</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.215)</td><td>-0.194 (0.207)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Log min wagex2008-2012</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.901**</td><td>0.851**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.419)</td><td>(0.426)</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.940</td><td>0.942</td><td>0.942</td><td>0.943</td></tr><tr><td>City-pair-year FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>City controls</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>3,578</td><td>3,578</td><td>3,578</td><td>3,578</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Standard errors, which are in parentheses, are clustered by city. $^{***}\\mathsf{P}<0.01$ $^{**}{\\mathfrak{p}}<0.05$ $^{*}\\mathbf{p}<0.1$  \n\nFinally, one might be concerned that while robots produced in China do not appear in the customs database, they might still be used by firms in the ASIF. As discussed earlier, only about 3,000 robots were produced by Chinese suppliers in 2012, according to data by the IFR (2014 IFR). However, one still may be concerned that the estimates may be driven by the omission of these domestically produced robots. The 2014 IFR report notes that the main customers of Chinese robot suppliers are concentrated in four industries corresponding to manufacturing electrical, electronic, rubber, and plastic products, respectively. In our industry analysis in Section 6.4, we find that an increase in the minimum wage has positive effects on robot adoption not only for the four industries above (columns (1), (5), (6), and (7) of Table 7) but also for those in which Chinese manufacturers do not supply many robots. Furthermore, the results for the former industries do not systematically differ from those for the latter ones. These observations mitigates concerns about the role of domestically produced robots.  \n\nA related concern is that the robots observed in the custom database may be imported by robot manufacturers in China, either as intermediate input or for R&D purpose. To address this concern, we make use of the ASIF variable that has the names of firms. We identify a firm as a manufacturer of robots if its name contains the Chinese characters for “robot.\" This step results in a list of 43 robot-manufacturing firms. We then repeat our analysis after dropping these firms and find the results to be unchanged. Next, we drop not only these 43 firms, but also all firms sharing the same 4-digit CIC industry, based on the assumptions that robot-producing firms should share the same disaggregate industrial classification. This step eliminates seven 4-digit CIC subindustries from our baseline sample.25 Table A.8 in the appendix presents the regression results based on the resultant sample. As Table A.8 shows, the coefficients on log minimum wage over 2008-2012 are slightly reduced, but they remain significant at the $5\\%$ level.  \n\nOne also may be concerned that our results could be driven by the construction of our city-pair-firm dataset. To address this concern, we show that our results hold in a panel of firms from all cities (instead of just those in a city pair straddling a provincial border) in Table A.9. A drawback to this alternative approach is that we can no longer include city-pair-year fixed effects to reduce endogeneity concerns.  \n\nFinally, one may be concerned by our choice of the sample period. We focus our analysis on 2004-2012, because the minimum wage system was less effective and robot adoption was very rare before 2004. In Table A.10, we include data from 2001 to 2012 in our analysis as a robustness check. As Table A.10 shows, an increase in the minimum wage continues to have positive effects on firms' robot adoption for 2008-2012, but not for the earlier years.  \n\n## 8. Conclusion  \n\nWith rising labor costs in China, robots are widely expected to play a greater role in the Chinese economy. Our analysis of the effects of minimum wages on firms' robot adoption suports this view to some extent. However, our heterogeneity analysis shows that the effects of higher minimum wages on robot adoption are far from uniform over time or across firms. This suggests that the relationship between labor costs and robot adoption is influenced by a myriad of factors such as institutional setting, firm productivity, and industry-specific robotics technology. Given the diversity of the Chinese economy along these dimensions, the patterns of robot adoption should continue to vary at the firm level. These diverse patterns of robot adoption could have important implications for the distribution of firm productivity and labor income in the economy.  \n\n# Declaration of Competing Interest  \n\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.  \n\n# Acknowledgments  \n\nWe thank the editor Scott Adams and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

Model with task-based production function  \n\nFollowing Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020), we extend our model into a multi-task framework. Under this framework, the production function satisfies  \n\n$$\ny(\\varphi)=\\varphi\\operatorname*{min}_{s\\in[0,1]}(l(s)+b(s)m(s)),\n$$  \n\nwhere I(s) and $m(s)$ denote the numbers of workers and robots used in task s, respectively, and $b(s)$ is a parameter governing the relative productivity between a worker and a robot. The comparative advantage of robots differ across tasks, as captured by the term $b(s)$ . Following Acemoglu and Autor (2011), we incorporate a Ricardian relation (Dornbusch et al., 1977) into our theoretical model by assuming $b(s)$ to be continuously differentiable and strictly decreasing. Therefore, there exists a cutoff $S^{*}$ for robot-adopting firms such that robots are used in tasks $S<S^{*}$ and labors are used in the tasks $s>s^{*}$ ， where $\\begin{array}{r}{b(s^{*})=\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{w}}\\end{array}$  \n\nOn the extensive margin, the firm compares its profits from producing without and with using robots. Given the wage for labor and the rental rate for robots, the firm's profit without using robots is given by  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{o}(\\varphi)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\biggl(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\frac{w}{\\varphi}\\biggr)^{1-\\sigma}P^{\\sigma-1}E.\n$$  \n\nIn comparison, the profit of the same firm when using robots is given by  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{r}(\\varphi)={\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\left({\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}}\\left(\\int_{0}^{s^{*}}{\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{b(s)\\varphi}}d s+{\\frac{(1-s^{*})w}{\\varphi}}\\right)\\right)^{1-\\sigma}P^{\\sigma-1}E-f\\cdot\\varepsilon.\n$$  \n\nTherefore, a firm adopts robots if and only if  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\left(\\int_{0}^{s^{*}}\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{b(s)\\varphi}d s+\\frac{(1-s^{*})w}{\\varphi}\\right)\\right)^{1-\\sigma}P^{\\sigma-1}E-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\frac{w}{\\varphi}\\right)^{1-\\sigma}P^{\\sigma-1}E>f\\cdot\\varepsilon.\n$$  \n\nIntuitively, because of the fixed cost associated with robot adoption, only more productive firms find it profitable to adopt them. Rearranging Eq. (6), we have  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*}=\\frac{\\Psi}{\\varphi^{1-\\sigma}f}\\left(\\left(\\int_{0}^{s^{*}}\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{b(s)}d s+(1-s^{*})w\\right)^{1-\\sigma}-w^{1-\\sigma}\\right),\n$$  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{\\Psi=\\frac{P^{\\sigma-1}E}{\\sigma}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\right)^{1-\\sigma}}\\end{array}$ $\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*}(\\varphi))=G(\\varepsilon^{*}(\\varphi))$ Futhermore,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial w}=\\frac{(\\sigma-1)\\Psi}{\\varphi^{1-\\sigma}f}g(\\varepsilon^{*})\\Bigg(w^{-\\sigma}-\\left(\\int_{0}^{s^{*}}\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{b(s)}d s+(1-s^{*})w\\right)^{-\\sigma}(1-s^{*})\\Bigg)>0,\n$$  \n\nWhre the inequality stemn fromn $\\begin{array}{r}{\\left(\\int_{0}^{s^{\\ast}}\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{b(s)}d s+(1-s^{*})w\\right)^{-\\sigma}(1-s^{*})}\\end{array}$ which eguals to $w^{-\\sigma}$ for $s^{*}=0$ and equals to for $s^{*}=1$ , is decreasing in $S^{*}$ . Hence, Proposition 1 in Section 3 continues to hold:  \n\nProposition A1. Conditional on firm productivity, $a$ frm's probability of adopting robots increases with an increase in the wage.  \n\nTo study the heterogeneous effects, we take the second-order derivatives with respect to $\\varphi$ and $f$ These derivatives are givenby:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial w\\partial\\varphi}=\\left(g(\\varepsilon^{*})+\\frac{\\partial g(\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial\\varepsilon}\\varepsilon^{*}\\right)\\frac{(\\sigma-1)^{2}\\Psi}{\\varphi^{2-\\sigma}f}\\left(w^{-\\sigma}-\\left(\\int_{0}^{s^{*}}\\frac{R_{r o b a t}}{b(s)}d s+(1-s^{*})w\\right)^{-\\sigma}(1-s^{*})\\right)}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial w\\partial f}=-\\left(g(\\varepsilon^{*})+\\frac{\\partial g(\\varepsilon^{*})}{\\partial\\varepsilon}\\varepsilon^{*}\\right)\\frac{(\\sigma-1)\\Psi}{\\varphi^{1-\\sigma}f^{2}}\\left(w^{-\\sigma}-\\left(\\int_{0}^{s^{*}}\\frac{R_{r o b a t}}{b(s)}d s+(1-s^{*})w\\right)^{-\\sigma}(1-s^{*})\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nf $\\varepsilon$ follows a nform distribution we hae $\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*}|\\varphi)}{\\partial w\\partial\\varphi}>0$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon^{*}\\right)}{\\partial w\\partial f}<0}\\end{array}$ Therefore,sitnnSetio tinues to hold as well.  \n\nProposition A2. The effects of higher wages on the probability of adopting robot are larger for firms with higher productivity and for firms with lower fixed cost of installing robot.  \n\nOn the intensive margin, the impact of the increase in labor costs is different. The number of adopted robots for robotadopting firms equals to  \n\n$$\nQ=\\int_{0}^{s^{*}}\\frac{1}{b(s)\\varphi}d s\\Bigg(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\Bigg(\\int_{0}^{s^{*}}\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{b(s)\\varphi}d s+\\frac{(1-s^{*})w}{\\varphi}\\Bigg)\\Bigg)^{-\\sigma}P^{\\sigma-1}E\n$$  \n\nDifferent from the extenstive margin, there are two opposite effects of an increase in labor costs on the intensive margin, whichsatisfies  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\partial\\ln Q}{\\partial w}}=\\underbrace{\\frac{\\frac{1}{b(s^{*})}}{\\int_{0}^{s^{*}}{\\frac{1}{b(s)}}d s}{\\frac{\\partial s^{*}}{\\partial w}}}_{\\mathrm{Substitution~Effects}}-\\underbrace{\\sigma{\\frac{1-s^{*}}{\\int_{0}^{s^{*}}{\\frac{R_{r o b o t}}{b(s)}}d s+(1-s^{*})w}}}_{\\mathrm{Scale~Effects}<0}\n$$  \n\nOn the right-hand side of the above equation, the first term corresponds to the substitution effects. The substitution effects couldbe writen as \" Beou-, which is lage than zero since b(s is decreasin in s he second term coresponds to the scale effects and is negative. These results give rise to the following proposition:  \n\nProposition A3. There are two opposite effects of an increase in labor costs on the intensive margin. The overall impact on the number of adopted robots for robot-adopting firms is ambiguous.  \n\n## Appendix B.

The shareholder value movement began as an invasion of the market for corporate control by financially oriented investors who critiqued sitting managers as not paying sufficient attention to the interests of shareholders during the economic crisis of the 1970s. It altered the relationship between financial markets and the managers of publicly held corporations. Subsequently, publicly held corporations have worked to raise share prices any way they can. While managers initially resisted shareholder value initiatives, they came to embrace them when their pay became tied to the share price. This created an incentive to discover new forms of financial extraction whenever a given set of strategies stopped producing new gains. We consider the impact that these reorganizations had on inequality and the relationship between shareholder value capitalism and financialization. We end by discussing the continuing relevance of shareholder value for understanding contemporary American capitalism. We also identify several avenues for future research on the evolution and consequences of shareholder value in the twenty-first century.  \n\n## INTRODUCTION  \n\nThe most significant change in American capitalism in the past 40 years has been the emergence and institutionalization of the shareholder value conception of the large corporation. This perspective conceives of the corporation as an entity that should be managed to maximize shareholder value, defined as undertaking actions to increase the stock price for shareholders (Shin 2013). The main characteristics of what happened are generally agreed upon: The power over large corporations shifted partly from management to shareholders, diversified conglomerates gave way to more focused firms, and finance and financial markets became more central in the functioning of American businesses (Useem 1993, Davis et al. 1994, Zorn et al. 2005, Davis 2009, Shin 2013). Companies came to be judged on the basis of their quarterly increases in shareholder value and less on other business objectives, such as the production of new and novel products and growth in sales and market share. Managers who embrace shareholder value maximization are not supposed to consider the interests of other stakeholders like workers and communities in their quest to raise the share price.  \n\nShareholder value can be conceived of as a description of the power relationship between the owners of a firm's shares and management, an ideology, a set of business strategies, and an orienting theoretical frame with which to make sense of the actions of managers and the owners of stock. As a description of who is in charge, it indexes the structural power of share owners and financial market intermediaries over management (Davis 2009). As an ideology, it operates to justify the actions of managers of corporations. Managers present themselves as representatives of shareholders and justify their actions in service to those interests (Lazonick & O'Sullivan 2ooo, Heilbron et al. 2014). As an institutionalized set of business strategies, it defines what kinds of actions managers will undertake to increase short-term profitability and increase the share price, particularly by using forms of financial engineering to produce positive short-term results (Fligstein & Shin 2007, Jung & Dobbin 2015). These will change over time and will spread across the population of corporations as they prove to be successful. As an orienting frame, it suggests what kinds of actions will make sense to managers and investors. It uses language that focuses on financial analysis and the data and statistics related to that form of analysis, like returns on assets and Tobin's Q, to show investors how the actions being taken increase the market capitalization of the firm (Lazonick 2013).  \n\nThe purpose of our review is to consider what we know about the origins of shareholder value capitalism, its transformative spread across large publicly held corporations, its evolution through various iterations, and its impact on income and wealth inequality in the United States.  \n\nThere are two issues that have been less documented but are key themes in our review. The first is contestation, which has been a significant aspect of shareholder value capitalism throughout. The shareholder value revolution began primarily as a social movement pitting outside investors against incumbent management teams (Useem 1993), but it was also propelled by contestation among different groups of investors (Heilbron et al. 2014). The adversarial dynamic between financial markets and managers was eventually resolved as managers came to adopt the shareholder value orientation, largely as a result of equity-based executive compensation. The subsequent struggle between managers and workers over who would bear the costs of investor extraction was clearly won by managers (Goldstein 2012), though not without creative efforts by labor groups to turn the tools of shareholder value to labor's benefit (Webber 2018, Jacoby 2021, Liu & Goldstein 2021). Since the turn of the twenty-first century, shareholder value has faced several normative challenges from factions of business elites, long-term asset managers, and social movements (Stout 2012, Carberry & Zajac 2021).  \n\nThe second issue is the dynamic evolution of shareholder value capitalism. To continually maximize investor returns, chief executive officers (CEOs) had to continuously innovate new forms of financial extraction to heighten earnings metrics, decrease costs, and signal to financial markets that they were serious about raising the share price. The problem is that once a set of tactics is deployed, then the gains have been captured. So, for example, reducing pension benefits for workers can dramatically increase short-term profit. But once those benefits are reduced, their impact on the bottom line comes to be factored into the share price. This has put constant pressure on CEOs to find new ways to extract profit. While scholars have documented the connection between investor pressures and the most significant labor-degrading managerial innovations in recent decades, they have not fully appreciated the extent to which implementation of these tactics has transformed the course of shareholder value capitalism by setting off a continual search for new sources of extraction. By the 2010s, the leading edge of shareholder value innovation had arguably moved beyond the domain of publicly traded firms altogether due to the exhaustion of extractive opportunities and significantly diminished number of public firms (Davis 2016). Even as shareholder value capitalism has persisted across four decades, it looks quite different now than during the 1980s.  \n\nAfter reviewing the scholarship on the origin and spread of shareholder value tactics, we consider how the focus of management on raising share prices has impacted income inequality. The literature shows that the tactics of shareholder value capitalism have disproportionately raised the income and wealth of the top $1\\%$ of earners and is one of the main causes of changing inequality (Tomaskovic-Devey & Lin 2011, Volscho & Kelly 2012). The literature also shows how a large part of the population found themselves with lower wages and reduced health and pension benefits (Fligstein & Shin 2004, Cobb 2015). This began with blue-collar workers during the 1980s and spread to white-collar workers in the 1990s (Osterman 1999). These processes were the direct result of management's implementing strategies to lower their obligations to their workforces and redistribute the gains to shareholders (Shin 2014).  \n\nWe also take up the relationship between shareholder value capitalism and financialization. In the past 15 years, scholars have focused on the idea that financialization, the use of financial criteria to evaluate decision making across a wide variety of social settings has increased (Epstein 2005, Krippner 2005). Some scholars have viewed financialization as more encompassing than shareholder value and driven by different forces (Epstein 2005, Hein 2012). Others view shareholder value as the driving force behind financialization (van der Swan 2014). We consider the linkages between these ideas and explore the degree of convergence and divergence in these research agendas.  \n\nWe conclude by considering the ongoing relevance of shareholder value in the context of some of the changes in American capitalism. In particular, we consider the rise of private equity, the financialization of the American economy writ large, and the emergence of the technology sector where the ideology of shareholder value has produced a new wrinkle on innovation. We conclude that the changes that have occurred reflect the continuing dominance of the idea that shareholders? interests should predominate. But we also demonstrate that shareholder value is a fexible concept into which many different ideas can be attached.  \n\n### THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SHAREHOLDER VALUECAPITALISM  \n\nThe term “market for corporate control\" refers to the stock market where actors with sufficient capital can buy enough shares of publicly held corporations to take control of them. Historically, management teams leading publicly held corporations were the main actors in this market as they were either the predators who bought up other companies through mergers or acquisitions, or the prey who found themselves the target of other corporations (Fligstein 1990, Useem 1993, Davis 2009). The term was coined by Henry Manne (1965), a financial economist, in response to the merger wave of the 1960s. Manne saw the basic logic of the market as being about management teams observing targets from firms with low stock prices that were poorly run and deciding to take them over to extract the value inherent in the firm. He argued that  \n\nthe lower the stock price, relative to what it could be with more effcient management, the more attractive the take-over becomes to those who believe that they can manage the company more efficiently. And the potential return from the successful takeover and revitalization of a poorly run company can be enormous. (Manne 1965, p. 112)  \n\nIn the 1960s, this market was dominated by the management teams of large corporations. Institutional investors and the financial markets themselves were not in control of who bought whom. Management teams were. These management teams were led by what Fligstein (1990) has called the “finance conception of the firm.\" At this time, the firm was first conceived of as a bundle of assets that managers would deploy and redeploy by the buying and selling of firms in order to maximize profits. During the 1960s, diversified portfolios of product lines would be manipulated to maximize profits. The idea had three parts. First, firms could smooth out business cycles by investing in businesses that performed differently as the economy expanded and contracted. Second, financial oriented managers would have closer control over assets and, thus, be able to use them to make more money either than they would as passive investors in stock portfolios, or than they might make by investing in them as free-standing firms. Finally, financially oriented executives would be able to make investments in firms and evaluate the likelihood that their investments would succeed based solely on financial criteria.  \n\nThe 1960s witnessed a large-scale merger movement, whereby many of the largest corporations substantially increased their size and diversification (Davis et al. 1994). It has been estimated that between 1967-1969, $40\\%$ of the 500 largest firms were absorbed in mergers or acquisition (Fligstein 1990). Many of the financial forms of reorganization, including hostile takeovers, divestitures, leveraged buyouts, the accumulation of debt, and stock repurchasing, were invented or perfected in this period. As a result of this success, financial executives increasingly became CEOs of large corporations. By 1969, the finance conception of control had come to dominate the market for corporate control and, by implication, the strategies and structures of the largest American firms. The financial conception of control, which dominated the market for corporate control during the 1960s, therefore already viewed the firm in primarily financial terms (Heilbron et al. 2014).  \n\nShareholder value capitalism is the ideology that represents the triumph of financial institutions and financial markets over the managers of publicly held corporations during the 1980s in dominating the market for corporate control (Lazonick & O'Sullivan 20oo). The shareholder value perspective critiqued the finance conception of the firm that focused on viewing the firm as an investment portfolio as failing to maximize shareholder value by its failure to raise share prices. What caused this critique to evolve? The large American corporation in the early 1980s was under siege from three exogenous forces: high inflation, slow economic growth in the 1970s, and increased foreign competition. As foreign competition, particularly with Japanese and German firms, heated up, American firms lost market shares and, in some cases, entire markets, such as consumer electronics (Useem 1993, Fligstein 2001, Zorn et al. 2005). The slow economic growth and high infation of the 1970s had a set of negative effects on large corporations. Slow economic growth meant that stock prices languished as investors fed the stock market. This was compounded by the high infation of the era. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates, and investors could earn high rates of return by buying government bonds. This pushed investors out of the stock market toward fixed income securities like government bonds.  \n\nInflation had several other impacts on the balance sheets of corporations. Firms avoided borrowing money because of high interest rates. This meant that firms kept large amounts of cash on hand to fund their activities. Their real assets (i.e., land, buildings, and machines) were also increasing in value due to infation. Because of the high inflation and poor economic conditions, profit margins were squeezed. Firms tended not to revalue assets on their books. If they did, then their financial performance would even look worse as standard measures of performance like return on assets would make poor profits stand out even more. With low stock prices, undervalued assets, and lots of cash, by the late 1970s, many large American firms had stock prices that valued them as being worth less than their assets and cash (Friedman 1985). This created a crisis of profitability during the 197Os for managers of large firms.  \n\nThe conditions were right for some form of change in how large publicly held corporations were governed. There were three problems: What would the analysis of problems look like, who would spearhead it, and what role would government play in sparking the new conception of the firm? During the late 1970s in America, the discourse of deregulation was already taking shape in the political arena. The Carter administration embraced the view that one way out of the stagflation (high inflation, low economic growth) economic crisis was to deregulate product and labor markets. The Carter administration began to experiment by deregulating the airlines and trucking industries.  \n\nThe presidential election of 1980 brought Ronald Reagan into power. Reagan embraced a pro-business, antigovernment agenda (Block 1996). The Reagan administration did several things that directly encouraged the merger movement of the 1980s (Davis & Stout 1992, Fligstein 2001). William Baxter, Reagan's attorney general in charge of antitrust, had been an active opponent of antitrust while an academician. In 1981, he announced new merger guidelines, which committed the government to approving almost all mergers except those that led to concentration ratios within particular markets of greater than $80\\%$ . This gave the green light to all forms of mergers, large and small, vertical and horizontal.  \n\nInstitutional investors began to realize that some firms had market values that were potentially less than the value of their saleable assets.1 They argued that incumbent management had created inefficient bureaucracies with too many disparate parts. This caused them to enter the market for corporate control, make hostile takeover bids, and dismantle or absorb existing firms (Davis et al. 1994). By breaking firms up, they could make money. Part of the problem for investment bankers and other institutional investors was raising the cash to engage in hostile takeovers. This led to the most important financial invention of the period, which was the high-yield or junk bonds to fund these purchases. These bonds could be used to buy up the shares of the firm, and then the new owners could engage in internal reorganization of the firm to pay the debt down. Between 1981 and 1986, there were over 2,900 mergers per year on average (Ravenscraft 1987). From this perspective, the 1980s market for corporate control was driven by the crisis in the already existing financial conception of the frm and the changes in the regulatory environment, which encouraged firms to use the market for corporate control to reorganize their assets (Davis & Stout 1992).  \n\nUnlike the prior merger wave during the 1960s, these reorganizations would involve divestitures and mass layoffs. The shareholder value rhetoric argued that those engaging in reorganizations should not worry about workers, consumers, or suppliers, but instead, their aim was to make more money for the owners of the assets.  \n\nThe question of who came up with the shareholder value conception of the firm and how they related to those who were working with the older financial conception of control has been studied extensively (Davis & Stout 1992, Useem 1993, Davis & Thompson 1994, Fligstein 2001, Heilbron et al. 2014, Knafo & Dutta 2020). There were a number of important actors involved, mostly in the financial community. These included investment banks, stock brokerages, and insurance companies, as well as financially oriented executives in mainstream firms. Davis & Stout (1992) described what happened as a social movement. These actors came to create the shareholder value framing of what corporations should be. This framing cemented an ideational shift represented by a shift in language from describing the dominant corporate strategy as retaining all product lines and reinvesting profits to downsizing labor forces and selling off product lines to make more profits that would then be distributed to shareholders (Zorn et al. 2005, Lazonick 2014).  \n\nThe role of academic agency theorists in the emergence of shareholder value is a matter of some debate (Stout 2012; see Jensen & Meckling 1976, Fama & Jensen 1983 for an exegesis of agency theory). Heilbron et al. (2014) provide good evidence that agency theory was not a key cause of the shareholder value revolution and came later as a justification of what was already happening. Other work has similarly suggested that managers and boards each selectively adopted those interpretations or implications of agency theory, which they could deploy to further their own interests (Dobbin & Jung 2010). Although agency theory provided an intellectual foundation and justificatory discourse for shareholder value management and corporate governance practices, the adoption of these practices does not appear to represent an instance of performativity in any strongsense.  \n\n### THEIMPACTOFSHAREHOLDERVALUEONCORPORATIONS ANDMARKETS  \n\nOne of the big ironies is that the shareholder value conception of the firm, which was touted as a corporate governance solution to make US corporations more competitive and profitable ( Jensen 1989), did not lead firms to higher profitability on average (Ravenscraft & Scherer 1987, Jensen & Ruback 1994, Fligstein & Shin 2007). Because many of the takeovers involved the use of debt, firms had a hard time showing higher levels of profit given their high levels of debt and their elevated equity prices. Of course, this did not necessarily pose a problem for shareholders, given that elevated share prices offered a more tax-efficient means of capturing surplus. Nor was this a concern for the other beneficiaries of the merger movement: the investment bankers who were paid large fees for making the deals.  \n\nThe link between maximizing shareholder value and firm competitiveness is even more tenuous. The literature on competitiveness shows that the main factors that determine whether or not a firm is competitive have to do with its competencies at organizing production and creating new and useful technologies. A narrow focus on shareholders to the exclusion of other constituencies in the firm tends to result in reduced investment in the future of the firm (Davis 2018a). It should not be surprising that American corporations never regained ground in industries where they lost competitive advantage to Japanese and European firms (i.e., consumer electronics, automobiles, luxury goods, and high-end precision machines) by attempting to maximize shareholder value. Instead, the general tactic of American managers when they faced aggressive competition would be to divest themselves of assets and exit product lines where they could not dominate.  \n\nSince 2010, the most favored tactic for managers to boost investor returns is stock buybacks (Lazonick 2013, 2014). Although buybacks are a longstanding tactic for distributing wealth to shareholders (Westphal & Zajac 2001, Zorn et al. 2005), corporations began buying back their stock at record rates during the post-2008 financial market recovery. Public firm buybacks totaled Oover $\\$800$ billion annually in 2018-2019. By using cash to buy stock, corporations restrict the supply of stock and raise the stock price. For managers whose pay is directly tied to the stock price, stock buybacks are a way to ensure that firms meet analysts′ quarterly earnings expectations (Almeida et al. 2016). The total effect was to raise share prices, but to do litle for the competitive position of the corporation. In 2017, the Trump administration orchestrated a massive tax cut for corporations. Fully three-quarters of that tax cut has been spent on stock buybacks. Many firms also used debt to fund stock repurchases. The resulting increases in leverage made firms especially vulnerable to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shock (Aramonte 2020).  \n\nThe effect of shareholder value imperatives on market structure and the scope of firms has come full circle since the 1980s. The end of the 1980s divestiture wave came when most of the good deals to buy and break up companies had been done. Subsequent merger and acquisition activity had a very different effect. One of the most important things that began to happen in the late 1990s was an increase in industry concentration (Boushey 2019, Philippon 2019). After the Reagan administration stopped enforcing the antitrust laws, conventional wisdom was that any corporate merger that did not literally create a monopoly was of benefit to consumers. The idea was that firms would build out economies of scale and scope by buying their competitors. This occurred in numerous industries, including banking, telecommunications and media, and airlines. The resulting increases in market power translated directly into higher investor returns (Grullon et al. 2019). Shareholder value capitalism, which emerged during the 1980s as a project to carve up large firms (Davis et al. 1994), had by the mid-2010s resulted in the highest levels of industry concentration since before the 1970s (Grullon et al. 2019). One consequence of this concentration, which we discuss further below, is that the number of publicly traded corporations in the United States declined by $50\\%$ between 1996 and 2016.  \n\n### THEIMPACT OFSHAREHOLDERVALUEONMANAGEMENT  \n\nOne part of the story that we have yet to tell is how managers came around to support shareholder value capitalism. During the 1980s merger movement, managers initially resisted the takeover of corporations by corporate raiders (Davis 1991, Useem 1993). Managers tried to convince boards of directors to create “poison pill\" devices to deter unwanted hostile takeover bids (Davis 1991). Poison pills would authorize the issuance of a large block of stock that would have the impact of raising the cost of doing a hostile takeover.  \n\nBy the early 1990s, however, the struggle between sitting management teams and institutional investors had largely resolved itself. Many older managers had been replaced by new executives whose training aligned with the doctrine of shareholder primacy. Managers agreed to implement organizational strategies that were perceived to be oriented toward raising the share price. In return, they retained control over the corporation and were given significant stock equity as an incentive to align their interests with those of shareholders (Goldstein 2012, Flaherty 2015). This compromise saw the average CEO pay climb from about 40 times that of the average worker in 1980 to over 300 times by 2001 (Bebchuk & Grinstein 2005).  \n\nOne of the issues that is still a bit murky is the degree to which financial institutions and markets really took over the governance of large publicly held corporations. One can make the case that managers had little choice but to work to maximize shareholder value or else lose their jobs (Useem 1993), especially as the countervailing power of managerial networks dissipated (Benton & Cobb 2019). But research has shown that firm executives also became savvy about using stratagems such as earnings management and decoupling to appease financial audiences without fully implementing the shareholder value programs (Westphal & Zajac 1998, 2001).  \n\nMoreover, firm managers actually became richer under shareholder value initiatives (Shin 2014, Dencker & Fang 2016). These managers began to see their salaries climb and their pay packets swell as they were given stock and stock options to encourage them to undertake reorganizations oriented toward raising the share price. The idea was that if managers were owners, they would be more likely to try and raise the share price. Some have argued that this means that the top managers, particularly CEOs, actually have won the battle between the financial markets and management by spouting shareholder value rhetoric with one hand and taking outsized pay for doing so with the other (Gordon 2000, Goldstein 2012). At the very least, managerial pay was one of the principal beneficiaries of shareholder value capitalism. As an incentive to undertake unpopular actions, like closing plants, slashing wages and benefits, and going offshore to produce goods, executives could capture a portion of the resulting surplus (Shin 2014). Viewed in classanalytic terms, this can be seen as a process whereby financial capital broke the postwar detente between managers and labor, coopting the former in order to weaken and displace the latter.  \n\n### THE IMPACT OF SHAREHOLDER VALUE RESTRUCTURING ONWORKERS  \n\nThere is a sizeable literature on the deleterious effects of the shareholder value conception on workers and organized labor. For managers tasked with increasing investor returns, reducing labor costs came to be seen as the most expedient path. In practice, this meant pursuing a relentless emphasis on cost-cutting through outsourcing, delayering, divestitures, layoffs, and employee benefit cuts (Fligstein & Shin 2007). Scholars have documented the devastating impact of these corporate reorganizations on labor forces. The manufacturing sector was hollowed out in a process of deindustrialization (Bluestone & Harrison 1984). Millions of blue-collar unionized workers lost high-paying jobs, and their incomes would never recover. Unionized labor forces were the focus of many efforts to transfer corporate cash fow from workers to shareholders (Fligstein & Shin 2007). Kochan & Dyer (2020) show that there has been a continued assault on the remaining set of unionized workers. By 2020, the percentage of unionized workers in the United States in the private sector has fallen to $6\\%$ of thelabor force.  \n\nHistorically, corporations that announced layoffs saw their stock prices plummet as it implied that the main markets for their products were in decline. But beginning in the late 1980s, stock markets came to construe layoff announcements as a signal of shareholder-friendly management whereby the number of workers would decline and their salaries would be added to corporate profits (Lazonick & O'Sullivan 2000, Jung & Dobbin 2015). By the 1990s, layoffs became decoupled from firm performance and were instead more closely associated with the strength of pressure on firms from financial markets ( Jung 2015). Markets rewarded firms for announcing layoffs in both good and bad times (Farber & Hallock 1999).  \n\nDuring the 1980s, the blue-collar labor force took the brunt of layoffs. But once this had happened, managers were still under pressure to cut costs and raise profits and the share price. This resulted in the downsizing of managerial ranks, particularly middle managers. It has been estimated that $50\\%$ of all male managers between the ages of 45 to 54 lost their jobs from 1990 to 1993 (Farber 1997). The idea was that there were too many layers of managers, and therefore removing them would result in savings. This had two impacts on both white-collar and blue-collar workers. First, they grew more insecure about losing their jobs (Blair & Kochan 2000). For whitecollar workers, the layoffs produced more pressure for those remaining to work longer hours and be available to deal with work issues at all hours. Thus began the idea that people were available 24 hours a day, seven days a week (Osterman 1999).  \n\nShareholder value pressures also contributed to diminishing job quality. Scholars have shown that beginning in the 1980s, corporations started to cut back on health care benefits and pension payments (Blank 1990, Averett & Hotchkiss 1995, Currie & Yelowitz 1999, Gustman & Steinmeier 1999, Cobb 2015). Before 1985, many American workers had defined pensions: They retired with a fixed amount of income that depended on how many years they worked at the company and what their final incomes were. By the late 1990s, these had virtually disappeared and were replaced by defined-contribution plans in which individuals took over the responsibility for their pensions. The savings from these expenditures went directly to the bottom line and worked to raise share prices.  \n\nThis relationship between shareholder value and pension benefit cuts is rife with ironies insofar as demands for greater returns from public sector defined-benefit pension funds such as the California Public Employees? Retirement System helped propel the disappearance of privatesector defined-benefit plans (Jacoby 2021). The fact that the shift to defined-contribution pensions turned a large share of American workers into stockholders also created new kinds of social class contradictions between workers’ role as workers and their role as savers whose retirement prospects are tied to shareholder value (Liu & Goldstein 2021).2 There is some evidence that this shift to 401k-type retirement plans has increasingly realigned workers’ political preferences with those of financial markets (Pagliari et al. 2018).  \n\nAnother set of strategies to increase shareholder value can be put under the rubric of outsourcing. Outsourcing implies buying goods and services that had previously been provided within the firm. Beginning in the 1990s, firms would outsource services like janitorial, security, and accounting to other firms (Weill 2014, Kochan & Dyer 2020). By removing employees, firms paid fewer benefits. From the point of view of the balance sheet, wages and salaries became business expenses. These kinds of gains drove firms to try to figure out which employees were core to their missions and which ones they could outsource (Dey et al. 2012). A second kind of outsourcing was that of plants, office space, and equipment. Historically, firms owned physical assets. But since these assets counted in the calculation of ratios such as return on assets, selling off physical assets and buying them as services that counted as business expenses made corporate performance look better. So, for example, if a firm sold its corporate office for $\\$10$ million, that amount would no longer appear in the denominator of the calculation of return on assets. Firms figured out that they could sell assets and pay rent, and even though nothing had materially changed, their returns on assets would go up. Weill (2014) has documented how outsourcing of jobs has continued to increase since2000.  \n\nAs part of outsourcing, corporations began in earnest to build global supply chains for their main products. Beginning in the 1980s and continuing into the 1990s and beyond, the American government strongly supported free trade. Indeed, a Democratic Congress in the 1980s refused to force corporations to compensate workers and communities for losses suffered when plant closures occurred when those plants were being sent overseas. This refusal started the exodus of blue-collar workers from the Democratic Party, setting up contemporary politics in which such workers are now the base of the Republican Party (Feigenbaum et al. 2018).  \n\nCorporations used free trade as a way to escape from expensive American unionized labor and shift production to lower-wage countries or regions (Bluestone & Harrison 1984, Autor & Dorn 2013). While there were costs associated with doing this, the benefits far outweighed the expenses. Some businesses began to experiment with outsourcing all of their production. Firms like Nike became relatively small companies who basically designed their products and marketed them (Davis 2009), while the production of those products was contracted out to factories in foreign countries with lower wages and fewer labor protections. Apple, for example, assembles all of its iPhones in China, using little or no American labor to produce the product. Globalization meant that financial returns for corporations went up and, with them, so did the price of the stock.  \n\nOne interesting body of research has explored how organized labor sought to contest the shareholder value attack on workers by mobilizing the power of labor-affliated pension funds as a countervailing political force (Webber 2018, Jacoby 2021). This involved compelling large pension funds to use their privileged voices in corporate governance in order to restrain managers? behaviorvis- $\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{a}}\\cdot$ -vis workers and unions. Although the workers’ capital movement has found success in some battles (Webber 2018), there is little evidence that these rearguard efforts have had any systematic effect in staunching declines in job quality (Liu & Goldstein 2021).  \n\n### SHAREHOLDERVALUE ANDRISINGINCOME ANDWEALTH INEQUALITY  \n\nEconomic inequality in the United States has risen dramatically since the mid-1970s. Income inequality as measured by the Gini index has increased by roughly $30\\%$ between 1970 and the present day, with much of that growth in inequality driven by massive income growth at the top of the earnings distribution (Autor et al. 2006, Piketty & Saez 2006, Kopczuk et al. 2010, Piketty et al. 2018). At the same time, middle-class jobs, defined as those held by people who occupy percentiles 40-80 of the income distribution, have seen their pay stagnate. Wealth inequality has become even more pronounced. The top $1\\%$ of the wealth distribution increased their share of overall wealth from $25\\%$ in 1980 to $40\\%$ in 2016 (Saez & Zucman 2016).  \n\nThe role of shareholder value capitalism in these changes is multifaceted. Not surprisingly, the various forms of shareholder value-driven corporate restructuring discussed above had farreaching distributional consequences. They allowed executives to capture economic gain at the expense of production workers (Shin 2014). Shareholders pressured managers to eliminate rents that were built into internal labor markets. Firms responded by opening up once-closed blue-collar labor markets to the external labor market. Without protection from unions or insulation from spot labor markets, production workers lost their monopoly on labor within firms’ internal labor markets and accordingly lost their monopoly rents (Dencker & Fang 2016). Managers, however, were able to extract even greater rents as their pay became increasingly tied to their ability to cut labor costs, generate shareholder value by increasing their firm's market value, and secure firm profits from financial income (Westphal & Zajac 1998, Goldstein 2012, Lin & Tomaskovic-Devey 2013, Flaherty 2015, Dencker & Fang 2016).  \n\nShareholder value strategies created conditions that undermined the ability of various groups of workers to maintain their positions. Under pressure from shareholders to cut labor costs, employers sought to achieve greater fexibility and profitability through nonstandard employment relations. Employers began to utilize more contract and temporary workers with no expectation of long-term employment or upward mobility (Kalleberg et al. 2000, Kalleberg 2003) and outsource peripheral and administrative functions (Dey et al. 2012, Weil 2014). These externalization strategies shifted lower-skill work out of large high-paying firms to smaller lower-wage firms, which led workers at the bottom of the occupational distribution to lose out on the wage premiums enjoyed by workers employed by large high-end firms (Pfeffer & Baron 1988, Cobb & Lin 2017).  \n\nAt the same time, labor unions that bargained to secure high wages and benefits for bluecollar workers saw their political power decline substantially (Fligstein & Shin 2004, Shin 2013). Declining unionization is responsible for rising inequality among union and nonunion workers, accounting for anywhere from one-fifth to one-third of the overall growth in wage inequality from the mid-1970s to mid-2000s (Western & Rosenfeld 2011, Card et al. 2017). While unions' bargaining power eroded, organized corporate interests consolidated their political power and secured bargaining advantages over unions and regulatory gains through lobbying the federal government (Hacker & Pierson 2010).  \n\nAt the same time that shareholder value capitalism increased wage inequality among employees, the overall share of income going to employees also declined. As the logic of shareholder value capitalism has expanded, the general workforce has found itself more separated from profitgenerating processes. As a result, labor finds itself at a greater bargaining disadvantage. Using establishment-level data, Falato et al. (2021) show that greater shareholder value pressures from institutional investors result in lower payrolls. Tomaskovic-Devey & Lin (2013) and Lin (2016) demonstrate that a growing reliance on finance-based income, rising levels of corporate debt, and shareholder distributions are strongly associated with a decline in the labor share of corporate income paid to workers and diminished firm employment (also see Alvarez 2015). Kristal (2013), meanwhile, suggests that computerization—which was a key shareholder value tactic during the 1980s and 1990s (Fligstein & Shin 2007)—-was the primary contributor to the decline in labor's positional power and income share, especially in manufacturing and transportation sectors.  \n\nThe finance-driven restructuring of nonfinancial firms also had second-order effects on inequality by redistributing large gains to the financial service industries, as extracted resources and rising equity asset values were redirected to other uses. Although employment in the finance industry has remained relatively low and stable since the postwar period, its share of corporate profits in the US economy more than quadrupled from just over $10\\%$ in 1950 to about $45\\%$ in 2000, while its share of the economy and employment have remained relatively stable (Krippner 2005). Financialization has had a substantial effect on changes in the income distribution over the past 40 years. Philippon & Reshef (2012) estimate that $15\\%$ to $25\\%$ of the overall increase in wage inequality since 1980 is attributable to income gains in the finance industry alone. At the same time as the finance sector came to command an additional $\\$6.5$ trillion in profits, compensation among those employed in finance rose from being about average compared with the overall economy to being $50\\%$ to $60\\%$ higher than the rest of the economy (Tomaskovic-Devey & Lin 2011, Philippon & Reshef 2012). These gains were disproportionately enjoyed by top managers and executives. Since the mid-1990s, CEOs in finance have enjoyed a $250\\%$ wage premium relative to CEOs in other sectors (Philippon & Reshef 2012). Although it is difficult to isolate the direct and indirect contributions of shareholder value capitalism to the growth of the finance sector since the 1980s, they are clearly linked.  \n\n### FINANCIALIZATION AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE  \n\nSince the 2000s, the study of shareholder value capitalism has been partly subsumed within a broader literature on financialization. The idea of financialization emerged in heterodox, or what might be termed post-Keynesian, economic thought as an alternative view of the way to characterize the modern version of capitalism (Epstein 2005). One of the most widely cited definitions of financialization is “the increasing role of financial motives, financial markets, financial actors and financial institutions in the operation of the domestic and international economies\" (Epstein 2005, p. 3). An alternative but related definition offered by Krippner (2005, p. 174) defines it as “a pattern of accumulation in which profits accrue primarily through financial channels.\" For these scholars, financialization refects the growing dominance of finance over the real economy (Orhangazi 2008, Stockhammer 2004, Palley 2013). Others relate the term to the growing size and liquidity of financial markets (Aglietta & Rebérioux 2005, Carruthers 2015). Financialization is a broad label that covers various empirical phenomena at different levels of analysis (for a review, see Van der Zwan2014).  \n\nWhile scholars who use the term financialization sometimes ignore the literature on shareholder value capitalism, their arguments engage many of the same features as the ones put forward here. Most scholars agree that financialization is a deeper historical transformation in the structure of capitalist economies whose roots parallel the analysis of shareholder value presented earlier. They agree that the financial crisis of the 1970s precipitated a change in the underlying logic of capitalism. They also view owners of financial assets as the principal beneficiaries of this change. At the center of financialization is the idea that “wealthy people who get most of their incomes from owning financial assets, rather than working or from owning productive assets” see their income and wealth grow more dramatically over time (Epstein & Power 2003, p. 3). Scholars have used a number of different metrics to index these shifts, including changes in the share of interest and dividends in national income (Stockhammer 2004, Orhangazi 2008, Hein 2012), the profits of financial institutions (Epstein & Power 2003, Jayadev & Epstein 2007,TomaskovicDevey & Lin 2011), the property income of households (e.g., Dunhaupt 2012), and share of business income and/or assets from financial sources (e.g., Krippner 2005, Rabinovich 2019).  \n\nOne main difference between these literatures at a conceptual level is which processes are thought to be subsuming others. From the vantage of macrolevel conceptualizations of financialization, shareholder value is simply one facet of the growing power of finance over the real econ-- omy. Meanwhile, the shareholder value literature treats investor power as predating and driving the financialization of accumulation in nonfinancial corporations. As investor extraction led to underinvestment, firms sought to substitute various forms of financial machinations for their diminished productive capacity. The mechanism of change for the shareholder value perspective emanates from the transformation of corporate governance in the 1980s through the realignment of power between managers and shareholders, and the construction of strategies to increase the returns to shareholders at the expense of workers (for an historical perspective on this issue, see Knafo & Dutta 2020).  \n\nSome firm-level studies have sought to put these concepts into conversation by analyzing the financialization of business strategy as a type of shareholder value tactic (Davis 2018b, Pernell 2020, Jung & Lee 2021), or as a redistributive mechanism within firms (Lin & Tomaskovic-Devey 2013). It remains unclear, however, to what extent the financialization of nonfinancial firms’ assets and accumulation strategies is directly tied to the power of investors over firms. Moreover, there is abundant evidence that the vast majority of corporations have redirected increased shares of resources to financial markets over the past four decades, as emphasized by the shareholder value perspective. In contrast, careful analysis of cash fow and asset statements reveals that accumulation from financial channels in nonfinancial corporations has been significantly less widespread (Rabinovich 2019; see also Soener 2015). This suggests that when it comes to nonfinancial corporations, the primary face of financialization appears in the guise of shareholder value management rather than financial accumulation. Continuing dialogue between scholars who focus on financialization and those who still see remnants of shareholder value could yield insights about the various ways in which the processes are similar or different and what can be learned by empirically examining the differences.  \n\n## WHITHER SHAREHOLDER VALUE CAPITALISM OR SHAREHOLDER VALUE2.0?  \n\nOne could make the case that shareholder value as a description of the core dynamics of American capitalism has run its course. The idea that twenty-first-century American companies are being run narrowly in the interests of investors does run in the face of several contrary data points. In the aggregate, large public corporations no longer occupy the same core socioeconomic position that they did four decades ago. The number of US exchange-traded firms declined from over 7,300 at its high point in 1996, to just 3,600 by 2016. Davis (2016) argues that this is one of the legacies of shareholder value, as corporations have either been swallowed up or taken private in order to escape the relentless need to show higher quarterly returns. He also argues that the remaining publicly held corporations do not employ as many people, making them financially valuable but not as important as employers. By this account, shareholder value capitalism cannibalized itself: There are fewer large corporations, and they no longer play a predominant role in structuring their members' life chances. Workers have been largely outsourced or disempowered. This means that there is less left for investors to extract through the old tactics of divestitures and de-unionization.  \n\nSecond, many of most successful and dynamic firms in the twenty-first century-—particularly those in the technology sector—-have largely resisted the standard doctrine of shareholder primacy. The Silicon Valley model of creating new ventures has generated innovation that does not rely on quarterly reports to financial analysts and is largely unresponsive to investors' interests in shortterm performance. Firms such as Facebook and Tesla remain buffered from investor pressures by governance mechanisms that allow their founders to maintain dominant control. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon until 2021, famously spent years growing his company and ignoring the pleas of the financial community to begin to make profits. Instead, he kept investing cash fow into new businesses, some of which expanded dramatically, and others which failed and disappeared. He ended up being one of the richest people in the world.  \n\nThird, there are indications that the ideology of shareholder value is being deinstitutionalized among segments of the business elites (Stout 2012). In 2019, the Business Roundtable, an influential association of corporate executives, revised its official stance on the purpose of the corporation, replacing its commitment to shareholder primacy (which had been its policy since 1997) with a multistakeholder conception. Although such symbolic pronouncements do not augur shifts in actual practices, they do suggest that shareholder value ideology has become a political liability and may be losing its sway as a normative institution or explicit basis of justification for managerial behavior.  \n\nFinally, finance has largely moved on. Having long ago succeeded in disciplining nonfinancial corporations to prioritize investor returns, the investment banks, pension funds, and leveraged buyout funds that propelled the shareholder value revolution have increasingly turned their focus to other ways of making money and transforming socioeconomic relations. These include such areas as securitization and structured financial derivatives, financial technology (fintech), lending, high-frequency trading, and private equity (Fligstein 2021).  \n\nWhile all of this is certainly true, shareholder value capitalism is now institutionalized, meaning that its core ideas are part of the way that people get jobs, work, get fired, and accumulate wealth. This institutionalization looks much like the process described by Berger & Luckmann (1966). In the first generation, a new set of meanings arises and seems new and novel. But in the second generation, it becomes taken for granted and just how things work. The workforce has almost entirely turned over since 1980. This means that almost no one remembers a time when people worked for the same corporation all their lives and pensions and benefits were part of how firms show loyalty toward workers. Now, everyone expects work to be insecure and low paid, to provide few benefits, and to make workers feel expendable. No one sees this as shareholder value capitalism: It is just capitalism.  \n\nThe pressure to increase stock prices has not abated since the 1990s. Managers know that to fund buybacks and keep earnings up, they need to constantly lower costs and reduce the importance of labor by investing in technology, outsourcing, and using global supply chains. These imperatives continue to place downward pressure on labor's share of income, even as increased outsourcing and reduced corporate employment (Davis 2016) mean that the effects of cost-cutting on workers are manifested less through their already downsized workforces, and instead increasingly through large firms squeezing their suppliers (Wilmers 2018).  \n\nHostile takeovers have become rarer as managers have learned to limit their vulnerability, but managers still must satisfy financial institutions and financial analysts to retain their compensation. Activist hedge funds- which do not engage in full-fledged takeovers-often achieve a similar effect by acquiring a minority share and mounting vocal public campaigns against management teams who are deemed to be leaving shareholder returns on the table. This results in continued forms of extractive corporate reorganization (DesJardine & Durand 2020, Mishel & Bivens 2021).  \n\nPrivate equity can also be viewed as a twist on the shareholder value idea. In this case, shareholders invest in firms that operate a group of firms, just like a 1960s conglomerate did. Private equity managers worry about rates of return on their capital and make investments to maximize those returns. They frequently load companies up with debt, restructure them, and often sell those companies back into the public markets to recoup their investment (Appelbaum & Batt 2014). Indeed, private equity is the main mechanism through which the tenets of shareholder value have spread to new domains beyond publicly traded corporations. This can be seen as an extension of the same process of tactical innovation that we discussed above: having run out of ways to extract resources in public firms, private equity firms have increasingly sought to invade, rationalize, and extract returns in fields traditionally populated by small proprietorships, partnerships, or nonprofits. Key examples of private equity reorganizing firms in existing markets include nursing homes and medical practices, single-family home rentals, and for-profit colleges (Eaton et al. 2020, Gupta et al. 2021).  \n\n### CONCLUSION:FUTURE RESEARCH  \n\nWe close by highlighting several key areas for future research about the course of shareholder value capitalism in the twenty-first century. First, how susceptible is shareholder value capitalism to ideational and political change? For decades the system described above has been undergirded by a dominant ideological doctrine of investor primacy. Since the 2008 financial crisis, however, many of the core tenets, assumptions, and tactics of shareholder value have come under sustained assault not only from labor and environmental activists but also from the managerial community and factions of financial elites. It is important to study whether these conflicts are being met by empty rhetoric on the part of organizations like the Business Roundtable and the World Economic Forum, or whether they spur firms to become less responsive to the myopic demands of financial markets. How (if at all) do the dynamics of shareholder value change in the aftermath of shareholder value ideology?  \n\nRelated to the above, financial market pressures have, meanwhile, also become more varied as a result of transformations in asset management. The rapid growth of socially responsible investment funds adhering to environmental, social, and governance standards; long-term oriented index fund managers (patient capital); and large socially activist pension funds all confront firms with more heterogenous articulations of shareholder demands (Braun 2021). Scholars should assess how these varied investor demands might be altering managerial behavior and how distinct factions and forms of capital are driving distinct trajectories of development within financial capitalism.  \n\nFinally, the growth of private equity highlights the need for more research on how shareholder value extraction works outside of large publicly traded corporations (Appelbaum & Batt 2014). Rather than capturing rents from fragmenting corporate bureaucracies and squeezing workers, the logic of financial extraction here often involves merging small operations in order to more efficiently exploit governmental subsidies, lax regulations, and vulnerable consumers (Eaton et al. 2020, Eaton 2020). Such dynamics also highlight the need for scholars to expand studies on the effects of shareholder value management to encompass a wider array of actors beyond workers.  \n\nFor instance, recent studies have begun to ask how investor ownership affects rates of eviction in home rental markets (Raymond et al. 2016), or to what extent cost-cutting in the aftermath of private equity takeovers of nursing homes contributed to elder deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic (Gupta et al. 2021).  \n\nAll of this suggests the enduring legacy of the shareholder value system. In the beginning of this article, shareholder value was described as an ideology, a set of power relations between owners and management, a set of business strategies, and a common set of understandings about how to evaluate the performance of corporations. The forms of this system have changed, as this article documents, in the past 40 years. But the notion that owners have priority over stakeholders and the evolving tactics of using financial ploys to extract more profit have remained. While many of its core ideas have become standard operating practices, shareholder value continues to produce new innovations and twists on its basic logic. Subsequent research should pay attention to how the old forms of wealth extraction remain robust, even as the pressures to find new forms evolve.  \n\n### DISCLOSURE STATEMENT  \n\nThe authors are not aware of any affliations, memberships, funding, or financial holdings that might be perceived as affecting the objectivity of this review.  \n\n### LITERATURE CITED  \n\nAglietta M, Reberioux A. 2005.

We show that firms with a higher share of skilled workers, and thus less fexibility to adjust their labor demand in response to cash flow shocks, hold more precautionary cash. The effect of labor skills on cash holdings is more pronounced for financially constrained firms and varies with exogenous differences in firing and hiring costs. We address endogeneity concerns by using subsamples of firms with reasonably similar characteristics, propensity score matching, and a quasi-experimental shock to labor markets.(JEL J24,G32,M54)  \n\nReceived March 21, 2014; editorial decision February 21, 2017 by Editor David Denis.  \n\nLabor is a heterogeneous factor of production, and differences in workers′ skill sets are a major source of this heterogeneity. While some firms heavily rely on highly skilled employees for their operations, others predominantly utilize lowskilled workers. In this paper, we investigate how a firm's reliance on skilled labor affects its cash management policy.  \n\nThe theoretical link between workers' skilllevel and cash holdings is based on an important friction in the labor market, namely, the costs of labor adjustment.  \n\nWhen a firm adjusts its labor demand, it incurs the costs of firing, search, selection, hiring, and training, as well as costs associated with productivity losses. These costs are economically significant, amounting to a one-year payroll cost for the average worker, and increase with the skill level of the labor force (e.g., Oi 1962; Shapiro 1986). In the presence of labor adjustment costs (LACs), a firm cannot adjust its labor demand costlessly and has the incentive to minimize its labor turnover (Dixit 1997). Failure to follow this optimal labor retention policy is particularly costly for firms relying on skilled employees, who are more likely to receive higher severance payments or file lawsuits if fired. Furthermore, searching for, hiring, and training new employees are more costly for jobs that require workers with advanced technical skills who are usually in shorter supply (Manning 2003; Dolfin 2006; Blatter, Muehlemann, and Schenker 2012). This difficulty means that time to replace skilled workers is typically longer (Oi 1962), causing greater disruption to productivity. In addition, employee layoffs, as a cost-cutting response to demand slumps, have a negative effect on a firm's stock price performance (Farber and Hallock 2009); the higher the skill level of the human capital laid off, the more pronounced the effect (Milanez 2012).  \n\nThe above arguments suggest that firms should avoid making costly labor adjustments by optimally maintaining employment at a stable level. This labor retention policy, however, exposes them to the risk of not being able to mitigate the impact of future cash flow shocks. We expect firms to have an incentive to hold precautionary cash to reduce this risk because cash reserves act as a buffer that safeguards against future cash flow uncertainty (Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach 2004; Han and Qiu 2007), thus enabling firms to maintain their optimal employment policy. Moreover, we argue that this precautionary motive for holding cash is stronger for firms that depend heavily on skilled workers. The greater a firm's reliance on skilled labor, the higher the costs of labor adjustment it faces and the stronger the incentive for the firm to retain skilled workers and hold precautionary cash. This argument is broadly consistent with Baghai et al. (2015) and Brown and Matsa (2016), who report that firms should adopt conservative financial policies to reduce the probability of distress as well as the labor-related costs of retaining and recruiting high-quality employees in distressed situations. In sum, we hypothesize that a firm's reliance on skilled labor has a positive effect on its cash holdings.  \n\nCrucial to our empirical analysis is the measurement of a firm's reliance on skilled labor. Like in Ochoa (2013) and Belo et al. (Forthcoming), we construct an industry-specific labor skill index (LSI) based on Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathsf{N E T}$ program classification of occupations according to skill level. The $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathsf{N E T}$ skill level classifications are based on how much education, related work experience, and training an employee needs to perform a given job at a competent level. LSI measures the weighted average skill level of the occupations within an industry and proxies for the LACs the average firm in that industry faces.  \n\nUsing LSI as a measure of labor skills, we find strong evidence that firms operating in industries with a higher share of skilled workers hold larger cash balances, which is consistent with our hypothesis. The impact of $L S I$ On cash holdings is economically significant: A one standard deviation increase in the index is associated with an increase in the cash-to-assets ratio of 4.2 percentage points, which translates to a $21.2\\%$ increase in the cash ratio relative to the sample mean. This positive association is robust to a variety of model specifications, including fixed effects regressions in which we control for firm and industry heterogeneity, as well as alternative definitions of both cash and labor skills.  \n\nA major concern with a causal interpretation of the relation between LSI and cash holdings is the potential endogeneity of labor skills. A firm's share of skilled labor may be endogenously chosen and related to unobservable factors that also affect its cash holdings, leading to a spurious correlation. We note that, by controlling for firm and industry fixed effects in our baseline regressions, we address one source of endogeneity that may lead to potential firm and industry heterogeneity bias. Reverse causality poses yet another concern. A firm's cash holdings may affect its ability to recruit skilled workers, implying causality from cash to LSl. We address these endogeneity concerns through three different strategies that involve using subsamples of industries and firms with reasonably similar characteristics, propensity score matching (PSM), and a quasi-natural experiment associated with exogenous variation in the costs of labor adjustment, the mechanism driving the relation between $L S I$ andcash holdings.  \n\nFirst, we run our analyses using subsamples of industries and firms with reasonably similar observable and unobservable characteristics. In addition to performing the fixed effects regressions mentioned above, these tests further reduce firm and industry heterogeneity bias. We focus on industries with abovemedian LSI (i.e., high-skill industries), as well as manufacturing industries, and then double-sort firms along these dimensions and examine a subsample of manufacturing and high-skill industries. The subsample results are similar to our baseline findings in that labor skills have a positive and significant impact on cash holdings. Second, we perform a series of PSM analyses to reduce heterogeneity along many dimensions as opposed to the single- or doublesorting used in the first test. Specifically, we match high-skill firms with lowskill firms on year, industry, and all the control variables using the whole sample or subsamples of similar firms. Our analyses of the treatment (high-skill) and matched (low-skill) firms again show that firms with greater reliance on skilled labor hold more cash.  \n\nOur final strategy exploits an exogenous shock to the labor supply as a result of labor migration from New Orleans to Houston following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Between 100,000 and 150,000 evacuees made the move, representing $3\\%-4\\%$ increase in the Houston population (McIntosh 2008). Given that those evacuees consisted of both highly and low-skilled workers (Gabe et al.  \n\n2005; McIntosh 2008; De Silva et al. 2010), the Katrina-induced increase in the labor supply should increase the thickness (i.e., the number of effective participants) of Houston's local labor market (Moretti 2011) and therefore result in lower LACs, on average, for firms headquartered in Houston compared with matched control firms. Moreover, we argue that the negative impact of the labor migration following Hurricane Katrina on LACs should be more pronounced for high-skill Houston-based firms, for at least two reasons. First, because the LACs of skilled workers are considerably higher in magnitude than those of unskilled workers, modest and comparable percentage reductions in the LACs of both types of workers should lead to a much greater decrease in absolute terms in the LACs faced by high-skill firms. Second, the increased thickness of Houston's local labor market is likely to reduce the probability of not filling a vacancy more for jobs requiring advanced skills than for unskilled jobs and to improve the employee-firm match quality more for highly skilled specialized employees than for low-skilled manual laborers (Moretti 2011; Bleakley and Lin 2012). Thus, the Katrina-induced migration to Houston should exert a stronger impact on the LACs of highly skilled workers than those of lowskilled workers. Based on these arguments, we expect Houston-based firms, in particular those with a greater share of skilled workers, to have had a lower precautionary savings motive for holding cash than the control firms. Using treatment firms headquartered in the Houston metropolitan area and matched firms headquartered in neighboring metropolitan areas, we run a differencein-differences regression, as well as a triple-differences specification with continuous treatment, the latter regression enabling us to capture the impact of exogenous variation in LACs on cash holdings conditional on different levels of LSl. Consistent with our predictions, the coefficients on the doubleand triple-differences terms are negative and significant. Overall, while it is difficult to completely rule out endogeneity concerns, taken together, our three tests all provide consistent evidence of a causal effect of $L S I$ oncash holdings.  \n\nNext, we examine variation in the relation between LSI and cash holdings taking into account (1） state-level differences in the costs of downward and upward labor adjustments (firing versus hiring costs) and (2) firm-level differences in the precautionary motive for holding cash. First, we follow Serfling (2016) and exploit exogenous variation in the costs of firing following the state-level recognition of wrongful discharge laws (WDLs). Firms in states with stronger employment protection laws face higher firing costs, giving them a stronger precautionary motive to build up cash reserves. We further expect the effect of WDLs on firing costs to be more pronounced for high-skill firms because WDLs pertain generally to full-time and nonunionized workers, who are typically more skilled. Additionally, skilled workers are more likely to litigate, thereby resulting in higher litigation risk and higher lawsuit costs for high-skill firms. We then investigate the impact of exogenous variation in the costs of hiring for firms headquartered in states that provide hiring credits (i.e., subsidies for companies that hire workers). We conjecture that the existence of high-quality hiring-credit programs leads to lower costs of hiring, thus weakening the precautionary motive for holding cash. In addition, the impact of these programs on hiring costs is more pronounced for high-skill firms because a large number of high-quality hiring-credit programs aims at creating high-quality, high-pay jobs and, hence, are likely to target firms that require skilled labor, given the positive correlation between wages and labor skills. Consistent with those predictions, we find that the relation between LSI and cash holdings is more (less) pronounced the higher (lower) the firing (hiring) costs resulting from the recognition of WDLs (the availability of highquality hiring-credit programs). Moreover, to the extent that WDLs and hiring credits proxy, respectively, for (state-level) variations in firing and hiring costs, our results also suggest that the impact of LSI, as a broader measure of LACs, on cash holdings is above and beyond the effects of those individual proxies forLACs.  \n\nSecond, we examine subsamples of firms that are financially unconstrained as well as those that are financially constrained, for which the precautionary savings motive is most relevant (Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach 2004, 2011). We find that the effect of skilled labor on cash holdings is indeed stronger for firms that are constrained, which gives further support to the precautionary motive explanation.  \n\nNext, we report results from several tests that aim to alleviate concerns about mechanisms other than LACs driving our results. In particular, we address the concern that our results are primarily driven by a different channel relating to intangible capital. Skilled workers hold firm-specific organizational capital and proprietary information that are typically embodied in key personnel (Brown and Petersen 2011; Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou 2013). Thus, firms with skilled labor may seek to protect valuable intangible assets, rather than labor skills, by holding precautionary cash. While the two channels (i.e., LACs and intangible capital) are not mutually exclusive and are thus difficult to disentangle, our tests show that the relation between labor skills and cash holdings remains positive and significant when we control for intangible capital using proxies established in recent studies (Peters and Taylor 2017) or concentrate on firms that have limited intangible capital. Taken together, these tests suggest that our findings are consistent with the LACs mechanism and not simply driven by an intangible capital channel.  \n\nThe main contribution of our study is that we provide novel evidence of the effect of skilled labor on cash holdings. While recent theoretical research has shown how cash holdings are related to labor-related considerations (Karabarbounis and Neiman 2012; Boeri, Garibaldi, and Moen 2014; Bacchetta, Benhima, and Poilly 2015), only a few empirical studies have examined the effect of labor market frictions on corporate cash policies. Klasa, Maxwell, and Ortiz-Molina (2009) focus on the bargaining role of cash when dealing with union pressures and show that a firm facing stronger unions will strategically hold less cash to improve its bargaining position. Schmalz (2015) studies how cash can help firms regain financial flexibility following an exogenous increase in labor rigidity after unionization and argues that the interaction between unionization and cash holdings can be driven by an incentive to manage human capital risk. We note that these two studies focus on the impact of unionization on cash, and neither explicitly considers heterogeneity in the labor skill level. Labor rigidity from unionization is mainly related to low-skilled workers, who primarily have the incentive to unionize. In contrast, our focus is on highly skilled labor and the impact of heterogeneity in labor skills on cash holdings.  \n\nOur study is related to a growing theoretical and empirical body of literature examining the interaction between frictions in the labor market and corporate capital structure. This literature seeks to explain firms’ leverage decisions through a number of labor-related considerations such as the human costs of bankruptcy (Berk, Stanton, and Zechner 2010), strategic bargaining with labor unions (Matsa 2010), employee treatment (Bae, Kang, and Wang 2011), unemployment risk (Agrawal and Matsa 2013), and labor market size (Kim 2015). In particular, recent research by Kuzmina (2013), Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin (2015), and Serfling (2016) exploits exogenous changes in firing costs resulting from the use of temporary workers or the passage of employment protection laws and provides consistent evidence that financial leverage is negatively related to labor rigidity. Our findings contribute to existing evidence by showing that high-labor-skill firms with high LACs follow conservative financial policies by holding more cash. Moreover, by using labor skills as a proxy for the costs of labor adjustment encompassing both firing and hiring costs, our study adds to prior research that has mainly focused on the impact of firing costs on financial leverage.  \n\nOur results also contribute to the established literature investigating the determinants of corporate cash holdings. Existing studies identify a number of factors affecting cash management policies (e.g., Opler et al. 1999; Bates, Kahle, and Stulz 2009; Azar, Cagy, and Schmalz 2016); see Almeida et al. (2014) for a recent survey of the literature. Our paper proposes workers’ skill level as a new and important determinant of cash holdings.  \n\nFinally, our paper is closely related to the two recent studies mentioned earlier, by Ochoa (2013) and Belo et al. (Forthcoming), which also consider the implications of labor heterogeneity. However, their focus differs from ours as they examine the impact of labor skills on asset prices. They show that firms with a high share of skilled labor have higher stock returns because they carry more risk and are more exposed to aggregate shocks in the economy. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate the interaction between workers’ skill level and firms’ financial policies with a focus on cash holdings.  \n\n## 1. Hypothesis Development  \n\nWhy does skilled labor matter for corporate cash policy? We argue that cash holdings are important to firms facing labor market frictions due to the presence of costly labor adjustment. Our argument combines two strands of literature, on LACs and on the precautionary savings motive. In the labor economics literature, Oi (1962) introduces the premise that labor is a quasi-fixed factor such that firms incur costs when they adjust their labor demand. Examples of these costs include the costs of fring (e.g., severance pay, lawsuits), search (e.g.. recruitment agency fees, advertising), selection and hiring (e.g., application screening, interviews), training, and costs associated with productivity losses (e.g., peer and supervisor disruption). Existing evidence shows that the LACs are economically significant and hence act as an important friction in the labor market (e.g., Pfann and Palm 1993; Hamermesh 1989, 1995; Manning 2006; Dube, Freeman, and Reich 2010).  \n\nPrior studies further show that the costs of labor adjustment are not fixed but increase with the labor skill level. This is because skilled workers are more likely to receive larger amounts of severance pay or to file lawsuits if laid off, hence increasing firing costs for high-skill firms (Dertouzos, Holland, and Ebener 1988; Autor, Donohue, and Schwab 2006). Similarly, the costs of hiring can be higher for high-skill firms because the search, selection, and recruitment processes are likely to be harder and more demanding for jobs that require advanced technical talents, which are usually in shorter supply (Manning 2003; Dolfin 2006). Oi (1962), for example, estimates the average lag between workers leaving a firm and being replaced to be longer for jobs with higher skill requirements, implying higher costs due to productivity disruption. In addition, a highly skilled job typically requires the incoming worker to undergo costly advanced training in the complex tasks he or she will perform. Indeed, the argument that LACs increase with workers? skill level is well supported by existing evidence (Dube, Freeman, and Reich 2010; Blatter, Muehlemann, and Schenker 2012; Blatter et al. 2016).1  \n\nThe presence of economically significant LACs, especially those of skilled labor, provides firms with an incentive to optimally retain workers and minimize labor turnover (Oi 1962; Dixit 1997). In light of recent research on the precautionary savings motive (e.g., Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach 2004), we argue that firms that seek to follow this optimal labor retention policy have an incentive to hold precautionary cash. In the presence of financing frictions, cash reserves allow a firm to hedge against future cash flow volatility (Han and Qiu 2007) while maintaining its optimal labor employment policy.2 We expect the precautionary savings motive to be stronger for firms with a higher share of skilled workers. The reason is that firms that rely more on skilled labor face higher LACs, which in turn slow their labor-demand reaction to cash flow shocks and generally reduce their ability to smooth unexpected future cash flows. In sum, we hypothesize that the degree to which a firm relies on skilled labor has a positive effect on its cash holdings.  \n\n## 2. Data and Summary Statistics  \n\n### 2.1 Measuring the reliance on skilled labor  \n\nWe construct an index to measure the extent of a firm's reliance on skilled labor using the OES data from the BLS and the U.S. Department of Labor's $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathsf{N E T}$ program classification of occupations based on skill level.? Formally, we define this index as  \n\n$$\nL S I_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{O}\\left(\\frac{E_{j i}}{E_{i}}*Z_{j}\\right),\n$$  \n\nwhere $E_{j i}$ is the number of employees in industry $i$ working in occupation $j,E_{i}$ is the total number of employees in industry $i,O$ is the total number of occupations in industry $i$ , and $Z_{j}$ is the $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathsf{N E T}$ program classification. The latter program classifies occupations into five job zones, ranging from job zone 1, which includes occupations that require little or no skill, to job zone 5, which consists of occupations that require extensive skill sets. These skilllevel classifications are based on how much education, related work experience, and training an employee needs to perform a job at a competent level.4 By construction, $L S I$ is an industry-level index that measures the weighted-average skill level of the occupations within an industry, ranging from one to five. A low score implies that the majority of workers in the industry require little or no skill to perform their jobs, while a high score indicates that a large share of the industry's workers needs extensive skill levels to perform their jobs adequately. We classify industries using three-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes for pre-2002 data and four-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for 2002 data and beyond (Donangelo 2014; Belo et al. Forthcoming). Our approach of using the distribution of skilled occupations within an industry to proxy for firms' reliance on skilled labor and their LACs is similar to approaches adopted in recent studies (Ochoa 2013; Donangelo 2014; Belo et al. Forthcoming).  \n\nTable1 Labor skill levels across different industries   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Industry</td><td>Reliance on skilledlaborindex(LSI</td></tr><tr><td>Full sample</td><td>2.471</td></tr><tr><td>Leastrelianceonskilledlabor</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gasoline stations</td><td>1.281</td></tr><tr><td>Restaurants and othereatingplaces</td><td>1.306</td></tr><tr><td>Services tobuildings</td><td>1.371</td></tr><tr><td>Amusementparksand arcades</td><td>1.448</td></tr><tr><td>Grocerystores</td><td>1.462</td></tr><tr><td>Departmentstores</td><td>1.637</td></tr><tr><td>Footwearmanufacturing</td><td>1.735</td></tr><tr><td>Mostrelianceonskilledlabor</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Legal services</td><td>3.318</td></tr><tr><td>Architectural,engineering,andrelatedservices</td><td>3.306</td></tr><tr><td>Colleges,universities,andprofessionalschools</td><td>3.226</td></tr><tr><td>Officesofhealthpractitioners</td><td>3.194</td></tr><tr><td>ScientificR&Dservices</td><td>3.187</td></tr><tr><td>Electronic and precisionequipment</td><td>3.134</td></tr><tr><td>Softwarepublishers</td><td>3.118</td></tr><tr><td>Accounting and taxpreparationservices</td><td>3.047</td></tr><tr><td>Managementand technicalconsultingservices</td><td>2.966</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table presents examples of industries with the least and most reliance on skilled labor. Our sample consists of 68,057 firm-year observations covering the period 1999-2012. We measure a firm's reliance on skilled labor using the fllowing index: $L S I_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{O}\\bigg(\\frac{E_{j i}}{E_{i}}*Z_{j}\\bigg)$ where $E_{j i}$ is thenumber of employee in industry working in occupation $j$ $E_{i}$ is thetotal number ofemployeesin industry $i$ ,and $o$ is the total number of occupations in industry $i$ . Finally, $Z_{j}$ is the U.S. Department of Labor's $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathrm{NET}$ program classification of occupations based on skill level; this program classifies occupations into five job zones, ranging from job zone 1, which includes occupations that require little or no skill, to job zone 5, which consists of occupations that require extensive skills. By construction, $L S I$ ranges from one to five: low (high) values imply that the majority of workers in the industry require few (extensive) skills in order to perform their jobs.  \n\nTable 1 presents the average values of $L S I$ for several industries. The results reveal important (cross-sectional) variation in LSl. For the purpose of illustration, we focus on industries with the highest and lowest degrees of reliance on skilled workers (i.e., high- and low-skill industries). At the high end, as expected, high-skill industries include legal services, engineering and architectural services, accounting and tax preparation services, and scientific research and development (R&D) services. At the low end, gasoline stations, services to buildings, grocery stores, and eating and drinking establishments are examples of low-skill industries.  \n\n### 2.2 Sample selection and variables  \n\nWe first use the OES data set to obtain industry-level occupational data for 1999-2012.5 Next, we merge these data with job-zone (occupational) skill-level  classifications  from  the $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathsf{N E T}$ program.

Cash holdings are the ratio of cash and short-term investments (che) to total assets (at). The reliance on skilled labor is defined in Table 1. Cash flow is earnings after interest, dividends, and tax but before depreciation (oibdp - xint - txt — dvc), scaled by the book value of total assets (at). Net working capital is measured as working capital (wcap) minus cash (che), scaled by total assets (at). Capital expenditures is the ratio of capital expenditures (capx) to total assets (at). Leverage is long-term debt (dltt) plus debt in current liabilities (dlc), scaled by total assets (at). Acquisitions are defined as the ratio of acquisitions (aqc) to total assets (at). The market-to-book ratio is defined as the book value of assets (at) plus the market value of common equity (prcc_f \\* csho) minus the book value of common equity (ceq), scaled by the book value of assets (at). Size is measured as the logarithm of the book value of assets (at) in 1999 dollars. To measure industry cash fow volatility, we calculate for each firm-year the standard deviation of (firm-level) cash fow to assets for the previous five years. Industry cash flow volatility (Ind. CF volatility) is then calculated as the average of the firm cash flow standard deviations for each industry, classified by two-digit SIC codes. R&D expenditures is the ratio of R&D expenses (xrd) to net sales (sale), and is set equal to zero when R&D expenses (xrd) are missing.Dividend dummy is a dummy variable set equal to one in years in which a firm pays common dividends (dvc), and zero otherwise.  \n\npopulation of Compustat firms over the same sample period, we use a firm's industry membership, defined by the three-digit SIC code pre-2002 or the fourdigit NAICS code from 2002 onward, to match the firm with a corresponding LSI score. We exclude firms with missing data for the main variables in our regressions. Consistent with the extant literature, we also exclude financial firms and utilities (i.e., firms with SIC codes between 6000 and 6999 or 4900 and 4999).  \n\nThe dependent variable in our regressions is cash holdings, which we measure using the ratio of cash and short-term investments to total assets. However, our results are robust to alternative measures of cash holdings, as reported in Section 4.2. In terms of the control variables, we follow Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009) and include the following determinants of cash holdings: cash flow, net working capital, capital expenditures, leverage, acquisitions, Tobin's q (market to book), size, industry cash flow volatility, and R&D expenditures; see Table 2 for detailed variable definitions. We winsorize these variables at the 1st and 99th percentiles of their distributions, to mitigate the effect of outliers. The final sample has 68,057 firm-year observations representing 10,760 unique firms covering 1999-2012.  \n\nTable3 Univariate analysis: Firm characteristics across different labor skill levels   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Overall sample (N = 68,057)</td><td>Firms with above-median LSI (N = 34,017)</td><td>Firms with below-median LSI (N = 34,024)</td><td>Test of difference in means (standard errors without clustering)</td><td>Test of difference in means (standard errors clustered at industry level)</td></tr><tr><td>Dependentvariable</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td>Cash holdings</td><td>0.198</td><td>0.261</td><td>0.136</td><td>***</td><td>***</td></tr><tr><td>Controlvariables</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash flow</td><td>-0.190</td><td>0.271</td><td>-0.109 -0.088</td><td>***</td><td>*** ***</td></tr><tr><td>Net working capital</td><td>0.148</td><td>-0.208 0.056</td><td>0.063</td><td>***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Capitalexpenditures</td><td>0.060</td><td>0.311</td><td>0.329</td><td>***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>0.320 0.022</td><td>0.022</td><td>0.021</td><td>***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Acquisitions Market-to-book</td><td>3.043</td><td>3.529</td><td>2.553</td><td>***</td><td>***</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>4.940</td><td>4.559</td><td>5.322</td><td>***</td><td>***</td></tr><tr><td>Industry CFvolatility</td><td>1.345</td><td>1.590</td><td>1.110</td><td>***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>R&Dexpenditures</td><td>0.491</td><td>0.841</td><td>0.142</td><td>***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dividenddummy</td><td>0.252</td><td>0.175</td><td>0.329</td><td>***</td><td>***</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table reports the mean firm characteristics for the full sample and two subsamples of firms according to their degree of reliance on skilled labor (i.e., firms with above- and below-median $L S I$ scores).Thedependent and control variables are defined in Table 2.

The mean and median cash holdings in our sample are $19.8\\%$ and $10.5\\%$ , respectively. These figures are in line with Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009), who report mean (median) cash holdings ranging from $19.4\\%$ to $24.0\\%$ $7.7\\%$ to $14.8\\%$ )for 1999-2006.LSI has a mean and standard deviation of 2.471 and 0.501, respectively, which are very close to the figures reported in recent studies. For example, Ochoa (2013) reports an average $L S I$ of 2.668, with a standard deviation of 0.448.  \n\nTable 3 shows the results of a univariate analysis conducted to compare the characteristics of firms with above- and below-median LSI scores (i.e., highand low-labor-skill firms). Column 1 reports the average characteristics of all firms in the sample. Columns 2 and 3 present the mean characteristics of highand low-skill firms, respectively. Column 4 reports the significance levels for the $t$ -tests of differences in the mean characteristics.6 Column 5 reports the significance levels of differences when we perform the $t$ -tests allowing the standard errors to be clustered at the industry level. Our comparison reveals that firms that rely more on skilled labor hold more cash. Specifically, the average cash holdings are $26.1\\%$ for high-skill firms compared to $13.6\\%$ for low-skill firms. The difference of 12.5 percentage points is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level, whether the standard errors are clustered or not, and is economically significant as it amounts to $63\\%$ of the cash balances of the average firm in our  \n\nTable4 The relation between cash holdings and skilled labor   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Variables</td><td colspan=\"2\">OLS</td><td>Across firm</td><td>Across industry</td><td colspan=\"2\">Fixed effects</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LSI</td><td></td><td>0.084***</td><td>0.095***</td><td>0.028***</td><td>0.013***</td><td>0.024***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Cash flow</td><td>0.008**</td><td>0.009***</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.041</td><td>0.017***</td><td>0.008***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.02)</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>(0.37)</td><td>(0.35)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Net working capital</td><td>-0.036***</td><td>-0.033***</td><td>-0.030***</td><td>-0.120***</td><td>-0.013***</td><td>-0.027***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Capital expenditures</td><td>-0.484***</td><td>-0.447***</td><td>-0.507***</td><td>-0.081</td><td>-0.212***</td><td>-0.315***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.59)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Leverage</td><td>-0.146***</td><td>-0.136***</td><td>-0.141***</td><td>-0.290***</td><td>0.055***</td><td>-0.117***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Acquisitions</td><td>-0.369***</td><td>-0.398***</td><td>-0.684***</td><td>-0.535*</td><td>-0.224***</td><td>-0.374***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.06)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Market-to-book</td><td>0.007***</td><td>0.007***</td><td>0.006***</td><td>0.011</td><td>0.005***</td><td>0.006***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.14)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Size</td><td>-0.008***</td><td>-0.006***</td><td>0.001</td><td>-0.007</td><td>0.005</td><td>-0.005**</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.75)</td><td>(0.19)</td><td>(0.12)</td><td>(0.03)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Ind.

In Model 1, we regress cash holdings on the control variables. In Model 2, we include $L S I$ as an additional explanatory variable. In Model 3, we perform a cross-sectional regression using the firm-specific time-series means of the variables. Model 4 is similar to Model 3 except that we use industry averages instead of firm averages. Models 5 and 6 control for firm and industry (three-digit SIC codes) fixed effects. All regressions include year dummies except for Models 3 and 4. All variables are defined in Tables 1 and 2. The $p$ -values in parentheses are based on robust standard errors clustered at the industry level, except in Model 4, where the $p$ -values are based on nonclustered heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors. \\*,\\*\\*, and $^{***}$ indicate significance at the $10\\%$ ， $5\\%$ ,and 1%level, respectively.  \n\nsample $(19.8\\%)$ . We also find that firms that rely more on skilled labor tend to be smaller, pay out less in dividends, have better growth opportunities, use less financial leverage, invest more in R&D, and operate in industries with more volatile cash flows. However, the differences in these characteristics are not always statistically significant between the high and low $L S I$ groupsoncewe allow for clustering of the standard errors.  \n\n## 3. Empirical Results  \n\n### 3.1 Cash holdings and skilled labor: Main results  \n\nTable 4 presents the regression results on the relation between the degree to which firms rely on skilled labor and their cash holdings. Since our key test variable, LSI, is measured at the industry level, we report $p$ -valuesbased on heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors, clustered at the industry level. The only exception is Model 4, where we perform a cross-sectional regression using industry time-series averages and thus report $p$ -values based on nonclustered heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors. All regressions include year fixed effects (except for the cross-sectional specifications in Models 3 and 4).  \n\nIn Model 1, we perform a pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation and regress cash holdings on the control variables mentioned above. For brevity, we do not discuss these results here, but note that they are broadly consistent with previous evidence in the literature (e.g., Bates, Kahle, and Stulz 2009) and in line with theoretical predictions regarding their effects on cash holdings. In Model 2, we include $L S I$ as an additional explanatory variable and find that the coefficient on $L S I$ is positive and highly significant. It is also economically significant at 0.084 as a one standard deviation increase in the index is associated with an increase in the cash-to-total assets ratio of 4.2 percentage points, which translates to a $21.2\\%$ increase in the cash ratio relative to the sample mean. The coefficients on the other explanatory variables are quite similar to those in Model 1, suggesting that the effect of $L S I$ on cash holdings is not driven by its correlation with these firm characteristics.  \n\nWe next investigate how the cross-sectional variation in cash holdings is determined by LSl. In Model 3, we perform a cross-sectional regression using the firm-specific time-series means of the variables. Like in Model 2, the coefficient on LSI (0.095) is significantly positive, but it is $13\\%$ greater in magnitude than in the former model. This finding suggests a strong cross-sectional relation between labor skills and cash holdings.  \n\nIn Model 4, we employ a cross-sectional specification that resembles Model3 but uses aggregate data at the industry level. That is, instead of using firmspecific, time-series averages, we use industry time-series averages, where industries are defined by three-digit industry SIC codes. The coefficient on LSI (0.028) remains positive and significant, indicating that industry-level cash holdings are determined by differences in the reliance on skilled labor across industries.  \n\nIn Models 5 and 6, we perform two fixed effects regressions to control for firm and industry (three-digit SIC codes) fixed effects, respectively. Despite the persistence of the labor skill level over time,7 we include these fixed effects to address a concern that not controlling for unobserved time-invariant firm- or industry-level factors (i.e., heterogeneity) may lead to a spurious correlation between $L S I$ and cash holdings. The results show that the coefficient on LSI remains positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level, although its magnitude is smaller than in the baseline regression (Model 2). Comparing these results with those for Models 2-4, we conclude that the variation in cash holdings is mainly driven by cross-sectional differences in $L S I$  \n\nOverall, our findings are qualitatively similar across a variety of model specifications: LSI has a robust and positive impact on cash holdings. This evidence is consistent with our hypothesis that firms relying heavily on skilled workers hold higher cash balances so as to follow an optimal labor retention policy, as implied by the higher LACs they face.  \n\n### 3.2  Addressing endogeneity concerns  \n\nA concern with our regression results so far is the potential endogeneity of LSI. A firm's dependence on skilled labor may be related to unobservable factors affecting its cash policy, leading to a spurious relation between LSI and cash holdings. Our fixed effects regressions in Models 5 and 6 of Table 4 control for firm and industry heterogeneity and thus alleviate to an extent the omittedvariable bias. Reverse causality is another possibility. A liquid balance sheet may improve a firm's ability to recruit skilled workers from the labor market, meaning that cash holdings may affect the firm's dependence on skilled labor. In the following subsections, we attempt to establish the causal link between labor skills and cash holdings through three different strategies.  \n\n3.2.1 Subsamples of industries with similar characteristics. To address the possibility that the relation between $L S I$ and cash holdings may be confounded by unobserved firm and industry heterogeneity, we examine subsamples of relatively similar industries and firms. First, we remove from our sample low-skill firms, which are likely to differ significantly from their high-skill counterparts in terms of unobserved characteristics, and focus on a subsample of the latter firms, that is, firms operating in industries with above-median LSI. Next, we look at a subsample of firms in the manufacturing sector (with SIC codes between 2000 and 3999) as well as a more focused subsample of manufacturing and high-skill firms. By examining relatively similar firms in a single sector, our tests reduce industry heterogeneity and help alleviate the omitted-variable bias. The results reported in Table 5 show that the coefficient on $L S I$ continues to be significant for these subsamples of relatively similar firms, suggesting that the positive relation between $L S I$ and cash is unlikely to be affected by heterogeneity bias.  \n\n3.2.2 Propensity score matching. To control for observable differences in firm and industry attributes, we next perform a PSM analysis. We match firms with above-median LSI with those with below-median LSI on year, industry, and all the control variables from our baseline regression.8 By matching on industry (using two-digit SIC codes),? we can also remove unobserved industry heterogeneity that may be correlated with our measure of labor skills. The results in Table 6 suggest that, as expected, firms with high labor skills hold more cash than propensity-score-matched firms with low labor skills (0.261 versus 0.177), the difference (0.084) being significant at the $1\\%$ level. This finding holds whether the standard errors are bootstrapped (Column 3) or clustered at the industry level (Column 4).  \n\nTable5 Cash holdings and skilled labor: Subsamples of industries with similar characteristics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">High-skill</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Manufacturing Industries</td><td rowspan=\"2\">High-sKill Manufacturing Industries</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industries</td></tr><tr><td>Variables</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LSI</td><td>0.089***</td><td>0.154***</td><td>0.158***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Cash flow</td><td>0.005</td><td>0.009</td><td>0.005</td></tr><tr><td>(0.13)</td><td>(0.12)</td><td>(0.49)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Net working capital</td><td>-0.027***</td><td>-0.036***</td><td>-0.030***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Capital expenditures</td><td>-0.576***</td><td>-0.586***</td><td>-0.792***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Leverage</td><td>-0.133***</td><td>-0.143***</td><td>-0.134***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Acquisitions</td><td>-0.553***</td><td>-0.439***</td><td>-0.634***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Market-to-book Size</td><td>0.007***</td><td>0.006***</td><td>0.006***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00) 0.003</td><td>(0.00) 0.003</td><td>(0.00) 0.003</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Ind.CF volatility</td><td>(0.39)</td><td>(0.28)</td><td>(0.19)</td></tr><tr><td>0.019**</td><td>0.009*</td><td>0.017*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">R&D expenditures</td><td>(0.04)</td><td>(0.08)</td><td>(0.06)</td></tr><tr><td>0.018***</td><td>0.018***</td><td>0.017***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Dividend dummy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Intercept</td><td>-0.093***</td><td>-0.072***</td><td>-0.119***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>0.047</td><td>0.095</td><td>0.122</td></tr><tr><td>(0.63)</td><td>(0.12)</td><td>(0.35)</td></tr><tr><td>Yearfixed effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations Adjusted R2</td><td>34,017 0.28</td><td>34,326 0.34</td><td>17,455 0.30</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table reports regression results regarding the impact of firms'reliance on skilled labor on their cash holdings for industries with reasonably similar characteristics.

It reports the results of the propensity score matching used to test for differences in cash holdings between firms with above-median $L S I$ andmatchedfirmswithbelow-median $L S I$ using the nearest-neighbor matching technique.We match firms on industry (two-digit SIC codes), year, and all the control variables from our baseline specification. We report the results for the whole sample and for subsamples of industries and firms with reasonably similar characteristics (manufacturing industries, high-skill industries, positive-R&D firms, and zero-R&D firms), using the median level of LSI within the subsample to split firms. Manufacturing industries are defined as industries with SIC codes between 2,000 and 3,999. High-skill industries are defined as industries with above-median LSI. All variables are defined in Tables 1 and $2.^{*},{^{**}}$ , and $***$ indicate significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $1\\%$ level, respectively.  \n\nindustries as well as for separate subsamples of positive- and zero-R&D firms. Using the subsamples of positive-R&D firms and high-skill industries enables us to focus on firms that relatively more heavily rely on skilled workers, for which we expect the impact of $L S I$ on cash holdings to be most pronounced.  \n\nConsistent with our hypothesis, all subsample results exhibit significant differences in the cash balances of high- and low-labor-skill firms operating in the same (manufacturing) or similar (high-labor-skill) sectors and having similar characteristics (positive or zero R&D expenses). Specifically, the differences are strongly significant when the standard errors are bootstrapped; they remain significant at the $5\\%$ $(10\\%)$ level for high-skill industries and positive-R&D firms (manufacturing industries and zero-R&D firms) when the standard errors are clustered at the industry level. In terms of magnitude, these differences vary between 0.019 and 0.106, being smallest for the subsample of zero-R&D firms and largest for the subsample of manufacturing firms. We note, however, that in relative terms, the difference (0.019) in the cash ratio of highand low-skill zero-R&D firms represents $14.2\\%$ $(16.5\\%)$ of the mean cash ratio of zero-R&D firms with above- (below-) median $L S I$ , which is economically significant.  \n\n3.2.3 Exogenous shock to labor markets: Hurricane Katrina. Our final strategy exploits an exogenous shock to the labor supply that occurred as a result of labor migration from New Orleans to Houston following Hurricane Katrina. Based on Current Population Survey (CPS) data for November 2005 through August 2006, McIntosh (2008) reports a figure of between 100,000 and 150,000 such evacuees, representing a $3\\%-4\\%$ increase in the Houston population. This exogenous labor supply shock was likely to make Houston's local labor market thicker by increasing the number of effective participants. Thick local labor markets are associated with lower LACs primarily for two reasons. First, they increase the probability of firms filling vacancies, thus reducing search, selection, and hiring costs (Moretti 2011). Second, they lead to better quality employee-firm matches, which are typically associated with longer employee tenures (Jovanovic and Rob 1989), and hence lower labor turnover and LACs (e.g., fewer productivity disruptions). Since Hurricane Katrina induced an exogenous change in LACs as opposed to a change in potential omitted variables, our experiment is designed to capture the impact of labor skills on cash holdings through the LACs channel.  \n\nWe report the results from our experiment based on Hurricane Katrina in Table 7. Our treatment group consists of firms headquartered in the Houston metropolitan area, while our control group consists of propensityscore-matched firms headquartered in neighboring metropolitan areas that were not affected by Katrina, either directly or indirectly (McIntosh 2008).10 We match firms on year, industry, and all covariates. Post is a dummy variable that takes the value of one (zero) for the year following (preceding) Hurricane Katrina. We study a short window around Hurricane Katrina since several studies report a substantial reverse fow of migrants a few years after Katrina (Groen and Polivka 2008, 2010; Paxson and Rouse 2008). Given the unprecedented devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, the declining economy in New Orleans, even pre-evacuation, and the uncertainty about the pace of recovery (e.g., Vigdor 2008), we assume that Houston-based firms might not have anticipated this significant reverse fow, which, therefore, should not have affected their decision making at the time of the influx of evacuees intoHouston.  \n\nIn Model 1 of Table 7, we run a difference-in-differences specification. The Houston\\*Post coefficient is negative and significant, indicating that the change in cash holdings from pre- to post-Katrina was more negative for firms headquartered in the Houston metropolitan area than for matched firms  \n\nTable7 Exogenous shock to labor markets: The effect of Hurricane Katrina   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Variables</td><td colspan=\"2\">Katrinaeffect</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td></tr><tr><td>LSI*Houston*Post</td><td></td><td>-0.160***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LSI*Houston</td><td></td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.045</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LSI*Post</td><td></td><td>(0.29)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.133***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">LSI</td><td></td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.066*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Houston*Post</td><td></td><td>(0.07)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.047**</td><td>0.359***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Houston</td><td>(0.04)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>0.016</td><td>0.135</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Post</td><td>(0.47)</td><td>(0.20)</td></tr><tr><td>0.064***</td><td>-0.265**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Cash flow</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.02)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.007</td><td>0.027</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Net working capital</td><td>(0.86)</td><td>(0.29)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.097***</td><td>0.024</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Capital expenditures</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.27)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.417***</td><td>-0.555***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Leverage</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.219***</td><td>-0.116***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Acquisitions</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.244***</td><td>-0.332***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Market-to-book</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>0.003</td><td>0.013***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Size</td><td>(0.54)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.011**</td><td>-0.015***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Ind.CFvolatility</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>0.011</td><td>0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">R&D expenditures</td><td>(0.42)</td><td>(0.96)</td></tr><tr><td>0.029***</td><td>0.018***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Dividend dummy</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.055***</td><td>-0.032*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Intercept</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.05)</td></tr><tr><td>0.291***</td><td>0.130</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Yearfixedeffects</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.20)</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>632</td><td>632</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R2</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.38</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table shows how the relation between firms'reliance on skilled labor and their cash holdings was affected by an exogenous shock to the labor supply resulting from labor migration from New Orleans to Houston following Hurricane Katrina. Houston is a dummy variable that takes the value one for companies headquartered in the Houston metropolitan area, and zero for matched companies headquartered in neighboring metropolitan areas that were not impacted by Katrina, either directly or indirectly. Post is a dummy variable that takes the value one (zero) for the year following (preceding) Katrina. We match firms on year, industry (three-digit SIC codes in Model 1 and two-digit SIC codes in Model 2), and all the control variables from our baseline specification.All variables, except the two dummy variables listed above, are defined in Tables 1 and 2. The $p$ -values in parentheses are based onrobust standard errors clustered at the industry level. \\*, $^{**}$ , and $***$ indicate significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $1\\%$ level, respectively.  \n\nheadquartered in neighboring metropolitan areas. This result is consistent with the expected impact of the increased labor supply on cash holdings through the reduction in LACs, as described above.  \n\nNext, we examine the net effect of the Katrina-induced migration on cash holdings by Houston-based firms compared to the control group for different skill levels. We argue that the Katrina-induced migration to Houston should have affected the LACs of highly skilled workers more than those of low-skilled workers for two reasons. First, although the supply of applicants for lowskilled jobs appears to have increased proportionally more than that for highly skilled jobs (Gabe et al. 2005; De Silva et al. 2010), the difference between the proportional increases in the supply of the two types of applicants is likely to have been small (McIntosh 2008). Accordingly, we anticipate that the LACs of both groups of workers would have experienced comparable percentage decreases. Still, given that the LACs of skilled workers are considerably higher in magnitude than those of unskilled workers (see footnote 1), modest and comparable percentage reductions in the LACs of both groups would have led to a much greater decrease in absolute terms in the level of the highly skilled workers'LACs.  \n\nSecond, the increased thickness of Houston's local labor market post-Katrina is likely to have reduced the probability of an employer not finding a qualified worker, and to have improved the quality of employee-employer matching more for specialized employees than for manual laborers (Moretti 2011; Bleakley and Lin 2012). To the extent that specialized employees (manual laborers) have higher (lower) skills, the Katrina-induced exogenous increase in the labor supply in Houston should have had a more pronounced impact on the LACs of highly skilled workers than low-skilled workers. This argument suggests that our anticipation above of similar reductions (in relative terms) in the LACs of both groups of workers is conservative. That is, it implies that the percentage decrease in highly skilled workers' LACs is likely to have been greater than the percentage decrease in low-skilled workers' LACs. Overall, this line of reasoning further strengthens our conjecture that, following Hurricane Katrina, the LACs of skilled workers based in Houston should have experienced a considerably larger decline in absolute terms than those of less skilled workers.  \n\nThe above arguments both suggest that the negative impact of the Katrinainduced labor migration on the cash holdings of Houston-based firms should be more pronounced for those with a greater share of skilled workers. To test this conjecture, in Model 2 of Table 7, we run a triple-differences (difference-indifference-in-differences) specification with continuous treatment (De Silva et al. 2010; Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian 2013). We find that the coefficient on the triple interaction term (LSI\\*Houston\\*Post) is negative and highly significant, which is consistent with our prediction.  \n\nAn alternative explanation of this result could be that the Katrina-induced migration not only reduced LACs but also affected wages and employment in the Houston area, thus reducing Houston-based firms’ wage bill and cash reserves. However, existing evidence of the impact of Hurricane Katrina on labor market outcomes for low- and highly skilled workers in the Houston area is, at best, mixed (McIntosh 2008; De Silva et al. 2010). De Silva et al.  \n\n(2010), for instance, use establishment-level data and find that post-Katrina the wages of firms in low-skill industries in the Houston area experienced $0.7\\%$ drop relative to firms in high-skill industries when compared to a control group of the same industries in Dallas; this finding suggests that the wage channel is inconsistent with our evidence of a stronger Katrina impact for high-skill firms in Houston. Moreover, the related immigration literature generally shows that migration has a small, if sometimes insignificant, effect on wages and employment in local labor markets (e.g., Card 1990, 2005; Friedberg 2001; Dustmann, Fabbri, and Preston 2005; Basso and Peri 2015). Although it is difficult to completely rule out the wage/employment channel, given the inconclusive and weak evidence in prior research of the impact of migration on wages and employment, we argue that the LACs mechanism is the main mechanism driving our results.  \n\n### 3.3 Heterogeneity in the impact of labor skills on cash holdings  \n\nNext, we examine potential heterogeneity in the relation between labor skills and cash holdings by conditioning on (1) variations in labor market frictions associated with LACs and (2) variations in capital market frictions relating to firms' degree of financial constraint. Specifically, we first study the effect of LSI on cash holdings when firms face exogenous variations in downward (firing) and upward (hiring) adjustment costs. We then examine how the LSI-cash relation is affected by differences in firms’ precautionary motive for holding cash.  \n\n#### 3.3.1 Downward versus upward adjustment costs  \n\n3.3.1.1 Variation in firing costs.  To proxy for differences in a firm's costs of adjusting its labor demand downward, we follow Serfling (2016) and exploit an exogenous variation in firing costs across U.S. states following the statelevel recognition of wrongful discharge laws since the 1970s.11 WDL measures the strength of WDLs in a state and is constructed by summing three distinct dummy variables for each of the three WDL exceptions, where each dummy is set equal to one if the firm is in a state that has adopted the exception in question and zero otherwise.12 Since the passage of WDLs increases firing costs, we expect firms in such states to have greater incentives to minimize labor turnover. Consequently, they have a stronger precautionary motive to build up cash reserves that allow them to cover any future cash flow shortfalls and avoid costly layoffs.  \n\nMoreover, we argue that the variation in firing costs due to WDLs should increase with the labor skill level. First, prior research shows that WDLs do not generally apply to temporary employees and in particular unionized workers, who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement (Miles 2000; Autor 2003). In contrast, WDLs typically pertain to full-time or nonunionized employees (Serfling 2016). Based on this argument, and to the extent that low-skilled workers are likely to be unionized while highly skilled workers typically are not, we expect the positive effect of WDLs on firing costs to be more pronounced for firms that rely more on highly skilled employees. Second, empirical evidence shows that WDLs not only matter more for skilled workers, but also these workers are more likely to litigate (Autor, Donohue, and Schwab 2006), thus increasing potential lawsuit costs for their employers. Dertouzos, Holland, and Ebener (1988) study WDL cases in California from 1980 to 1986 and report that around $54\\%$ of plaintiffs held executive or managerial positions. This finding implies that high-skill firms in states that recognize WDLs are likely to have higher litigation risk than low-skill firms in the same states. Furthermore, WDL trials can be costly for firms since there is a high probability of plaintiffs winning, leading to substantial compensatory damages. For example, Dertouzos, Holland, and Ebener (1988) document that plaintiffs prevailed in $68\\%$ of the WDL trials in California between 1980 and 1986 and wereawarded on average $\\$650,000$ , or more than $\\$1.3$ million in 2012 dollars. Importantly, the earnings and age of the plaintiff explain more than $30\\%$ of the case-to-case variation in these damages. Since earnings and $L S I$ are positively related (Murphy and Welch 1992), we expect firms with high shares of skilled workers to face higher compensatory damages than those with low shares of skilled workers.  \n\nOverall, we conjecture that the passage of WDLs should have a significant and positive effect on the firing costs of firms, hence providing them with a greater incentive to hold precautionary cash. Furthermore, this effect should be stronger among high-skill firms because they are more likely to employ a larger share of workers affected by these laws, face higher litigation risk, and subsequently contend with higher lawsuit costs. To capture this effect, we include an interaction term between WDL and $L S I$ and anticipate its coefficient to be positive. In Table 8, Model 1, we show that $L S I$ has a significantly positive impact on cash holdings, which supports our main hypothesis. Importantly, consistent with our prediction above, the interaction term $(L S I^{*}W D L)$ is also positive and significant, which indicates a positive marginal effect of $W D L$ on the LSI-cash holdings relation.13  \n\nTable8 Cash holdings and skilled labor: Downward vs. upward adjustment costs   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td>LSI</td><td>0.042***</td><td>0.102***</td><td>0.063***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.01)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>WDL</td><td>0.020</td><td></td><td>0.012</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.25)</td><td></td><td>(0.39)</td></tr><tr><td>LSI*WDL</td><td>0.022***</td><td></td><td>0.016***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td></td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Hiring credits</td><td></td><td>0.052</td><td>0.030</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.13)</td><td>(0.29)</td></tr><tr><td>LSI* Hiring credits</td><td></td><td>-0.041***</td><td>-0.025**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.04)</td></tr><tr><td>Cash flow</td><td>0.010***</td><td>0.011***</td><td>0.011***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Net working capital</td><td>-0.030***</td><td>-0.031***</td><td>-0.030***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditures</td><td>-0.433***</td><td>0.374***</td><td>-0.396***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>-0.129***</td><td>-0.130***</td><td>-0.128***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Acquisitions</td><td>-0.403***</td><td>-0.407***</td><td>-0.401***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Market-to-book</td><td>0.006***</td><td>0.007***</td><td>0.006***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>-0.007***</td><td>-0.006***</td><td>-0.007***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Ind.CF volatility</td><td>0.011*</td><td>0.011*</td><td>0.011*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.08)</td><td>(0.07)</td><td>(0.08)</td></tr><tr><td>R&D expenditures</td><td>0.019***</td><td>0.020***</td><td>0.019***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend dummy</td><td>-0.054***</td><td>-0.058***</td><td>-0.054***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Intercept</td><td>0.108**</td><td>0.039</td><td>0.079**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.01)</td><td>(0.17)</td><td>(0.03)</td></tr><tr><td>Yearfixedeffects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>50,861</td><td>50,833</td><td>50,833</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R2</td><td>0.31</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.31</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table presents our findings on how the relation between a firm's reliance on skilled labor and its cash holdings is affected by exogenous variations in downward versus upward adjustment costs. We examine how differences in the costs of firing or hiring across states affect the relation between $L S I$ and cash holdings.Model 1 investigates how differences in the costs of firing affect this relation. WDL measures the strength of Wrongful Discharge Laws (WDLs) in a state and is constructed by summing three distinct dummy variables for each of the three WDLs exceptions, where each dummy is set equal to one if the firm is in a state that has adopted the exception in question, and zero otherwise. Model 2 examines how differences in the costs of hiring across states affect the $L S I$ and cash holdings relation.Hiring credits is a dummy variable that takes the value one if the quality rating of the job creation subsidies within the state in which the firm is headquartered is $C-$ or above,andzero otherwise (Mattera et al. 2011). In Model 3, we examine how differences in firing and hiring costs affect the $L S I$ and cash holdings relation concurrently. All variables, except the dummy variables listed above, are defined in Tables 1 and 2. The $p$ -values in parentheses are based on robust standard errors clustered at the industry level. \\*,\\*\\*, and $***$ indicate significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $1\\%$ level, respectively.  \n\n3.3.1.2 Variation in hiring costs. Next, we examine the impact of hiring credits (i.e., subsidies paid to employers that hire workers) on the labor-skillscash-holdings relation. Our analysis is motivated by Neumark and Grijalva's (forthcoming) evidence that some state subsidy programs can be effective in boosting firm employment.14 Although there is great variety in the provision and standards of state-level economic development subsidy programs (Mattera et al. 2011), the majority of these subsidy programs requires job creation as a condition for firms to receive any form of subsidy. We follow Mattera et al.'s (2011) systematic approach to identifying high-quality hiring-credit programs. Their method involves scoring these programs, with a view to ranking them in terms of perceived quality: A higher score assigned to these programs implies higher effciency in creating high-quality jobs. Using those (state-level) ratings, we construct a hiring credit dummy variable that indicates the existence of highquality job creation subsidies in the state in which a firm is headquartered. We conjecture that, in states with these high-quality hiring-credit programs, the costs of hiring will be lower, making the precautionary savings motive weaker. We further predict that the decrease in hiring costs resulting from the availability of high-quality subsidy programs will increase in importance with firms' reliance on highly skilled labor. This is because a large number of those subsidy programs has wage requirements, under which firms are either allowed to receive hiring credits only if they have wage thresholds in place or the level of credits they receive depends on wage thresholds. These thresholds vary from minimum wage to well above average state or sector wages, which, for some programs, reach $300\\%$ of mean wages. Given the significantly positive correlation between wages and worker skill level (Murphy and Welch 1992), subsidy programs requiring high wage thresholds are likely to target job creation in firms that require skilled labor. Importantly, such programs are given a higher score according to Mattera et al.'s (2011) rating system. In other words, a program that targets the creation of skilled jobs (i.e., has higher wage thresholds) receives a higher score. We therefore anticipate that high-quality hiring-credit programs decrease hiring costs more for firms with greater reliance on skilled workers. To capture this effect, we create an interaction term between the hiring credits variable and LSl. We expect the coefficient on this interaction term to be negative. The regression results in Model 2 of Table 8 provide strong evidence in support of our prediction. The coefficient on the interaction term between hiring credits and labor skills is indeed negative and highly significant.15 Finally, in Model 3 of Table 8, we include all additional regressors examined in Models 1 and 2 above (i.e., variables proxying for differences in firing costs as well as those proxying for differences in hiring costs). We find that after controlling for variation in both WDLs and hiring credits, LSI remains significantly positive, which is consistent with our argument that labor skills are an important proxy for all components of LACs (Oi 1962; Hamermesh and Pfann 1996) and suggests that the impact of $L S I$ on cash is above and beyond that of firing and hiring costs. More importantly, we continue to document strong evidence that the LSI-cash-holdings relation varies with the strength of labor protection and the quality of hiring-credit programs in the state in which the firm is headquartered. Taken together with the results in Models 1 and 2, these findings suggest that the impact of labor skills on cash holdings is more important in labor markets with higher downward adjustment costs and less pronounced in labor markets with lower upward adjustment costs.  \n\n3.3.2 The effect of financial constraints. The precautionary motive for holding cash is most relevant for financially constrained firms (Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach 2004, 2011; Han and Qiu 2007) since the use of cash as a buffer to avoid costly labor adjustments in response to cash flow shocks is more important when financial constraints are binding. We thus predict that the positive relation between labor skills and cash holdings is more pronounced when firms face greater frictions in capital markets. To test this prediction, we split our sample into constrained and unconstrained firms. We measure the degree of financial constraints using three different proxies: the size and age (SA) index (Hadlock and Pierce 2010), the Kaplan and Zingales (KZ) index (Kaplan and Zingales 1997), and the Whited and Wu (WW) index (Whited and Wu 2006). We define firms with above-median scores on the SA, KZ, and WW indexes as constrained and those with below-median scores as unconstrained.  \n\nTable 9 shows how the relation between firms’ reliance on skilled labor and their cash holdings varies with their degree of financial constraint. Models 1 and 2 report the results for the two subsamples of constrained and unconstrained firms according to the SA index. In line with the precautionary savings motive, the coefficient on LSI is higher for constrained firms (O.093) than for unconstrained firms (0.061); the difference is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. Models 3 through 6 reveal similar patterns when we proxy for financial constraints using the KZ or WW index. In sum, our findings are consistent with the prediction that the positive impact of $L S I$ on cash holdings is more pronounced for constrained firms.  \n\n## 4. Robustness Checks and Additional Analyses  \n\n### 4.1 Labor adjustment costs or intangible capital?  \n\nFirms relying on skilled labor may also have substantial “intangible capital.\" Specifically, these firms may have important intangible assets created by R&D expenditures as well as human and organizational capital knowledge embedded in their skilled workers (Falato, Kadyrzhanova, and $\\mathrm{Sim}2013$ ; Klasa et al. 2015). Consequently, cash holdings may be positively related to $L S I$ through  \n\nTable9 Cash holdings and skilled labor: The effect of financial constraints   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">SA index</td><td colspan=\"2\">KZ index</td><td colspan=\"2\">WWindex</td></tr><tr><td>Const.</td><td>Unconst.</td><td>Const.</td><td>Unconst.</td><td>Const.</td><td>Unconst.</td></tr><tr><td>Variables</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>LSI</td><td>0.093***</td><td>0.061***</td><td>0.067***</td><td>0.043***</td><td>0.094***</td><td>0.047***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Cash flow</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.013**</td><td>-0.246***</td><td>0.001</td><td>-0.250***</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.085***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Net working capital</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.70)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.32)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.034***</td><td>-0.218***</td><td>0.003</td><td>-0.301***</td><td>-0.020***</td><td>-0.167***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Capital expenditures</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.26)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.620***</td><td>-0.387***</td><td>-0.253***</td><td>-0.647***</td><td>-0.591***</td><td>-0.351***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Leverage</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.143***</td><td>-0.222***</td><td>-0.054***</td><td>-0.375***</td><td>-0.110***</td><td>-0.241***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Acquisitions</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.654***</td><td>-0.300***</td><td>-0.277***</td><td>-0.419***</td><td>-0.496***</td><td>-0.274***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Market-to-book</td><td>(0.00) 0.008***</td><td>(0.00) 0.027***</td><td>(0.00) 0.008***</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>0.056***</td><td>0.006***</td><td>0.016***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Size</td><td>(0.00) 0.029***</td><td>-0.012***</td><td>-0.003</td><td>(0.00) -0.011***</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.19)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>0.004 (0.49)</td><td>-0.009***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Ind.

For instance, to the extent that high-labor-skill firms wish to protect their valuable intangible assets, and given uncertainty in the future cash flows generated by such assets, these firms may have a strong precautionary motive for holding cash. While this prediction is consistent with our central hypothesis regarding the direction of the relation between LSI and cash holdings, it is based on a mechanism that operates through the protection of intangible capital rather than LACs. Although there is no indisputable way of disentangling the two channels, since intangible capital and labor skills should be highly correlated, we conduct additional tests to show that the impact of skilled labor on cash holdings is above and beyond the effect of intangible capital.  \n\nFirst, we examine a subsample of firms that have zero R&D expenditures. We argue that firms reporting zero R&D must have fewer intangible assets and, as a result, less incentive to hold precautionary cash to protect such assets. By focusing on firms for which the risk of losing intangible assets is relatively low, we can isolate the effect of labor skills on cash holdings that is directly caused by LACs considerations. We note that, in our PSM analysis presented above, we report results from a matched sample of high- versus low-skill zeroR&D firms that are consistent with our conjectures on the impact of skilled labor on cash holdings. In addition to these results, in Model 1 of Table 10, we report the findings for the subsample of zero-R&D firms using our main (unmatched) sample. We find the coefficient on LSI to be significant and positive at $1\\%$ for these firms, which supports our central argument based on the LACs mechanism. More importantly, in Model 4, we investigate a subsample of firms with zero R&D expenditures and a high share of skilled labor. Using this restricted subsample, we contend that a significant difference between the cash balances of high-skill firms and those employing less highly skilled labor should be mainly due to variation in the LACs associated with these skill levels. In line with this prediction, we find that the coefficient on LSI remains positive and significant for this restricted subsample.  \n\nA potential limitation of the above analysis is that investments in R&D are not an encompassing measure of intangible capital. To address this concern, we follow the economics literature (Lev and Radhakrishnan 2005; Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel 2009; Corrado and Hulten 2010) and recent finance research (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou 2013; Falato, Kadyrzhanova, and Sim 2013; Peters and Taylor 2017) and employ a more comprehensive measure of intangible capital. In particular, we consider both internally created and externally purchased intangible capital like in Peters and Taylor (2017). We measure the stock of internally created intangible capital as the sum of knowledge capital and organizational capital. We estimate the stock of knowledge capital by accumulating past R&D spending using the perpetual inventory method. The stock of organizational capital is estimated by accumulating a fraction of past selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses using the same method.16 Following Peters and Taylor (2017), we use the balance sheet item \"Intangible Assets\"’ to measure externally purchased intangible capital.  \n\nSimilar to our earlier analysis for zero-R&D firms, in the remainder of Table 10, we present results for the whole sample (Models 2 and 3) and for  \n\nTable10 Cash holdings and skilled labor: Labor adjustment costs or intangible capital?   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"3\">Wholesample</td><td colspan=\"3\">High-skill firms</td></tr><tr><td>Zero- R&D</td><td>IC control</td><td>Low IC</td><td>Zero- R&D</td><td>IC control</td><td>Low IC</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>LSI</td><td>0.025***</td><td>0.087***</td><td>0.049***</td><td>0.060***</td><td>0.078**</td><td>0.129***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.01)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Intangible capital</td><td></td><td>0.020**</td><td>0.101*</td><td></td><td>0.020**</td><td>0.121**</td></tr><tr><td>Cash flow</td><td></td><td>(0.02)</td><td>(0.08)</td><td></td><td>(0.02)</td><td>(0.02)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.002</td><td>0.008**</td><td>0.029**</td><td>-0.001</td><td>0.002</td><td>0.028</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.61)</td><td>(0.02)</td><td>(0.04)</td><td>(0.79)</td><td>(0.70)</td><td>(0.26)</td></tr><tr><td>Net working capital</td><td>-0.033***</td><td>-0.035***</td><td>-0.073***</td><td>-0.025***</td><td>-0.029***</td><td>-0.082**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.03)</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditures</td><td>-0.188***</td><td>-0.429***</td><td>-0.345***</td><td>-0.235***</td><td>-0.580***</td><td>-0.445***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>-0.099***</td><td>-0.153***</td><td>-0.176***</td><td>-0.088***</td><td>-0.156***</td><td>-0.213***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Acquisitions</td><td>-0.223***</td><td>-0.424***</td><td>-0.255***</td><td>-0.281***</td><td>-0.592***</td><td>-0.402***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Market-to-book</td><td>0.004***</td><td>0.006***</td><td>0.009***</td><td>0.004***</td><td>0.007***</td><td>0.009***</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td><td>(0.00)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.010***</td><td>-0.006**</td><td>-0.010***</td><td>-0.014***</td><td>-0.002</td><td>-0.007</td></tr><tr><td>Ind.

Models 1—3 report the results for the whole sample. In Models 4—-6, we present the results for the high-skill firms (above-median $L S I$ firms). Models 1 and 4 report the results for firms with no R&D spending. In Models 2 and 5, we include Intangible capital as an additional control. In Models 3 and 6, we examine the impact of $L S I$ on cash holdings for firms with low intangible capital (bottom $30\\mathrm{th}$ percentile).We follow Peters and Taylor (2017） and define Intangible capital as the sum of internally created and externally purchased intangible capital.We measure the stock of internally created intangible capital as the sum of Knowledge capital, which we estimate by accumulating past R&D spending using the perpetual inventory method,and Organizational capital,which we estimate by accumulating a fraction $(30\\%)$ of past selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses using the same method. Externally purchased intangible capital is the balance sheet item Intangible assets(intan).We scale Intangible capital by the book value of total assets (at). All models include year dummies. All variables are defined in Tables 1 and 2 of the paper. The $p$ -values in parentheses are based on robust standard errors clustered at the industry level. \\* $^{**}$ , and $***$ indicate significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $1\\%$ level,respectively.  \n\nthe subsample of high-skill firms (Models 5 and 6). We perform two tests. First, in Model 2, we check the robustness of our results to the inclusion of the comprehensive measure of intangible capital as an additional control. We find that intangible capital is positively and significantly related to cash holdings, which is in line with Falato, Kadyrzhanova, and Sim (2013). However, controlling for intangible capital does not affect either the statistical or the economic significance of the coefficient on LSl. Second, in Model 3, we examine a subsample of firms that have low intangible capital (bottom 30th percentile). We find the coefficient on $L S I$ to be positive and significant at  \n\n$1\\%$ for these firms, which supports our central argument based on the LACs channel. The results remain qualitatively unchanged in Models 5 and 6 when we rerun the regressions for the subsample of high-skill firms.  \n\nOverall, the above tests show that the positive relationship between LSI and cash holdings continues to hold when we control for a comprehensive measure of intangible capital or concentrate on firms with potentially limited intangible capital. We conclude that our results remain consistent with a LACs explanation and thus are unlikely to be driven only by the intangible capital channel.  \n\n### 4.2 Alternative measures of cash holdings and labor skills  \n\nWhile the cash-to-total assets ratio is the most traditional measure of cash holdings, some studies use alternative definitions (e.g., Opler et al. 1999; Klasa, Maxwell, and Ortiz-Molina 2009). To establish the robustness of our results, we replicate our main regressions using two alternative measures of cash holdings, namely, the natural logarithm of cash and short-term investments, scaled by book assets net of cash and short-term investments, and the natural logarithm of the ratio of cash and short-term investments to total sales. Untabulated results confirm that the coefficient on LSI is positive and highly significant.  \n\nWe also consider an alternative measure of labor skills, which we construct similarly to our original LSl. The only difference is that, instead of using the $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathsf{N E T}$ skill zones to proxy for the level of skill of an occupation $(Z_{j}$ in the original $L S I$ ), we use the occupation's average hourly wage. We use the OES data set to collect data on wages at the occupational level. In untabulated analysis, we rerun our baseline regression and find that the coefficient on $L S I$ remains positive and highly significant. Overall, we conclude that our findings are robust to alternative definitions of cash holdings and LSI.  \n\n### 4.3 Further tests  \n\nWe conduct a series of additional tests that showcase the robustness of our main result and offer more insights on the relations between skilled labor and cash holdings as well as a related corporate policy, namely, financial leverage. To conserve space, we report and discuss the results from these tests in the Internet Appendix.  \n\nFirst, we control for several important determinants of cash holdings identified by recent papers, which may also be related to our measure of labor skills. In doing so, we further mitigate the potential omitted variable bias and rule out alternative explanations for the effect of labor skills on cash holdings. The results in Table IA.1 of the Internet Appendix show that the impact of skilled labor on cash holdings remains positive and significant after controlling for the industry unionization rate (Klasa, Maxwell, and OrtizMolina 2009), product market characteristics, such as industry concentration and product market fluidity (Haushalter, Klasa, and Maxwell 2007; Hoberg, Phillips, and Prabhala 2014), refinancing risk (Harford, Klasa, and Maxwell 2014), and foreign tax burden (Foley et al. 2007). Second, we examine the impacts of labor skills on the cash flow sensitivity of cash (Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach 2004) and the market value of cash (Faulkender and Wang 2006). The results in Tables IA.2 and IA.3 of the Internet Appendix suggest that firms with a higher share of skilled labor have a higher propensity to save cash from their cash fows and enjoy a higher market value of cash, which further highlights the importance of cash reserves for high-skill firms. Finally, we test the proposition that high-skill firms, which face significant LACs, should adopt conservative financial policies by maintaining not only high cash holdings but also low financial leverage. The results reported in Table IA.4 are consistent with this conjecture and recent evidence on the impact of firing costs on capital structure (e.g., Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin 2015; Serfling 2016).  \n\n## 5. Conclusion  \n\nWe have investigated the impact of a firm's reliance on skilled labor on its cash management policy. Firms differ in their degree of reliance on skilled workers and face substantial LACs that increase with their workers’ skill level. This labor market friction incentivizes firms to optimally keep their employment stable. However, following an optimal labor retention policy reduces firms' ability to adjust labor demand in response to cash flow shocks, exposing them to future cash flow shortfalls. Therefore, we have hypothesized that firms with a high share of skilled workers have a precautionary motive to hold cash reserves, which safeguard them against unexpected cash fow fuctuations while allowing them to keep labor turnover optimally low.  \n\nIn line with this hypothesis, we have documented novel evidence that our labor skill index, measured at the industry level, has a positive and significant impact on firms’ cash holdings. Furthermore, the impact of labor skills on cash holdings is robust to a variety of model specifications, alternative measures of the variables of interest, and tests controlling for alternative explanations. To mitigate endogeneity concerns, we have employed three different strategies based on subsamples of relatively similar industries and firms, PSM, and a quasi-natural experiment associated with exogenous variation in LACs. While it is difficult to fully rule out endogeneity, taken together, these tests provide consistent results, all pointing to a causal effect of labor skills on cash holdings.  \n\nNext, we have examined variation in the LSI-cash-holdings relation. We find the impact of labor skills on cash to be stronger in labor markets with higher downward adjustment costs and weaker in labor markets with lower upward adjustment costs. We also have observed that the positive relation between LSI and cash continues to hold after controlling for exogenous differences in hiring and firing costs, suggesting that the effect of LSI, as a broader measure of LACs, on cash is above and beyond that of individual proxies for LACs (i.e., employment protection laws or hiring credits). Furthermore, consistent with the precautionary savings motive, we find the effect of $L S I$ on cash holdings to be stronger for firms that are financially constrained. Additional analysis shows that firms that rely more on skilled labor have a higher marginal value of cash and tend to save more precautionary cash from their cash flows.  \n\nFinally, we addressed the concern that our results may be primarily driven by the intangible capital channel rather than LACs; under this alternative channel, for example, high-labor-skill firms would build up cash reserves mainly to protect valuable intangible assets rather than skilled labor. Although the two channels are not mutually exclusive, our analysis shows that the impact of labor skills on cash holdings is consistent with the LACs mechanism and not simply due to the intangible capital channel.  \n\nOverall, we have shown that high-skill firms respond to high LACs by adopting conservative cash policies. Our findings suggest that labor heterogeneity, and in particular the skill level of workers, is an important determinant of corporate cash holdings.  \n\n## References  \n\nAbadie, A., and G.

Although time-series data from industrial countries appear consistent with this notion, crosssection data generally appear to contradict the assumption. A commonly used calculation suggests that labor shares of national income vary from about .05 to about .80 in international cross-section data. This paper suggests that the usual approach underestimates labor income in small firms. Several adjustments for calculating labor shares are identified and compared. They all yield labor shares for most countries in the range of .65-.80.  \n\nInternational data on income shares pose a puzzle for economists.1 Within most countries, the shares of national income accruing to capital and labor appear to be fairly constant over long periods of time. This is true for many poor countries as well as the United States, United Kingdom, and most rich countries for which data are available. In fact, the long-term stability of factor shares has become enshrined as one of  \n\nThis research was supported in part by National Science Foundation grant NSF/SBR 9515256. Portions of the paper were written while I was on leave at Yale University, and I gratefully acknowledge the support of the Economic Growth Center at Yale and the Gaylord Donnelley Fellowship administered by the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies. I owe a particular debt to Alwyn Young for his insightful comments. The original impetus for this research came from discussions with Tim Kehoe, Ed Prescott, and members of the Applied Theory working group at the University of Minnesota. Cheryl Doss read and commented on several drafts. Raphael Bergoeing and Francois Ortalo-Magne provided early requests for a manuscript and helped me conceptualize the topic, and Jim Schmitz and Stephen Parente provided encouragement at key stages.  \n\n1 I shall use the terms “income shares\" and “factor shares\" interchangeably here; both terms refer to the fraction of national income accruing to different factors of production. These shares are reported in a portion of the national income and product accounts (NIPA) often referred to as the “functional distribution of income.\"  \n\nthe “stylized facts\" of growth (e.g., Kaldor 1961). Across countries, however, there appear to be large differences in income shares. Why should there be such discrepancies between cross-section observations and timeseries observations? And what do these differences imply for the widespread use of model specifications that imply constant factor shares across countries and over time?  \n\nTaken at face value, the discrepancy between the time-series data and the cross-section data points to several possible conclusions, none of which is particularly appealing. One explanation would be that countries do not operate the same aggregate technology. A second possibility is that countries share a common aggregate technology, but because of institutional arrangements or fixed factors, income shares simply differ across countries. A third alternative is that some countries might face imperfect factor markets, so that wages are not equated to marginal value products. These possibilities are briefly explored below.  \n\nThis paper argues, however, for a fourth alternative. Specifically, I suggest that more careful treatment of the data leads to calculated income shares that are approximately constant across countries. I focus on differences in self-employment rates across countries. For a number of reasons, the labor income of the self-employed is often treated incorrectly as capital income. When income shares are corrected to reflect this fact, the large differences in income shares between rich and poor countries become much smaller. The variation that remains is not obviously related to levels of economic development.  \n\nIn spirit and substance, this paper resurrects some of the work of Kravis (1962) concerning the functional distribution of income. Kravis pointed out that entrepreneurial income as a share of gross domestic product was shrinking over time as a result of long-term shifts in the structure of employment—away from agriculture and self-employment and into industrial wage labor. In this paper, I argue that the same structural changes account for many of the apparent cross-country differences in the data.  \n\nSection I of this paper reports data on income shares as they are commonly computed. Section II suggests some possible explanations for the patterns observed in the data. Section IHI explores several alternative adjustments. Finally, Section IV briefly sketches out some of the implications of these findings for current research.  \n\n### 1.  Employee Compensation Shares: Patterns and Complications  \n\nMacroeconomists typically calculate factor shares not from firm-level data but from aggregates in the NIPA. A widely used strategy is to estimate the labor share of national income from the share of employee compensation in GDP. The returns to capital are then taken to be the residual. Such data are readily available for many countries.?  \n\n![](images/0c0ee0d1082e5aeaefaad6ccb31b4efc2d4cf6767f7298fb791e8bcc4882a75b.jpg)  \nF1G. 1.—Employee compensation share of GNP, United States and Great Britain, 1935-85. Source: U.S. Department of Commerce (1986, 1990). British data: Mitchell (1988),Pp.823-25.  \n\nTime-series data indicate that employee compensation shares of national income have been relatively constant in the United States over long periods of time. Since 1935, the employee compensation share of GDP has remained in the range of 65-75 percent of GDP (U.S. Department of Commerce 1986, 1990). Figure 1 shows the time series for the United States and the United Kingdom dating back to 1935 (Mitchell 1988). Similar patterns emerge for other countries for which relatively long time periods are available. The data suggest that the employee compensation share moves very little over time and is quite constant across rich countries.  \n\nThe stability of the time-series data on factor shares has long encouraged economists to look favorably on models that attribute the same aggregate technology to all countries. In particular, these data have frequently been invoked to justify the use of Cobb-Douglas functional forms.? Indeed, the eponymous Cobb and Douglas (1928) were among the earliest authors to point out that, for the United States, the labor share of income appeared to be roughly constant over time, regardless of changes in factor prices.  \n\nIn recent years, however, economists have begun to pay closer attention to international cross-section data that include observations on developing countries. The international data appear to show wide disparities in labor shares across countries. For example, employee compensation shares of GDP for 94 countries were available in the 1992 edition of the United Nations National Accounts Statistics (1994).\\* These data show enormous variance. The lowest share of employee compensation in GDP was reported in Ghana, with .051 of GDP; the highest share was reported for Ukraine, with .77o. Fully 18 of the countries reported employee compensation shares lower than .30 of GDP; eight countries reported employee compensation shares of .60 or higher.  \n\nMoreover, the data appear to show some consistent patterns. Poor countries are more likely than rich countries to have low shares of employee compensation in GDP. Figure 2 shows employee compensation shares plotted against levels of real per capita GDP; the scatter plot shows a clear positive relationship. This suggests that the labor share increases with economic growth. But this pattern runs precisely counter to Kaldor's “stylized facts,” and it thus appears to undermine models that generate constant factor shares across time and space.  \n\n### II. Possible Explanations  \n\nThere are several possible explanations for why factor shares might differ across countries. One possibility is that factor shares differ across countries because each country in fact faces a different aggregate technology. Differences in technology are perhaps the least appealing explanation, because it is not clear why the relationship between inputs and outputs should suddenly shift at a national frontier.? Moreover, it is not clear why production technologies should vary with per capita GDP rather than with geography. Why, for example, would the production technology differ so greatly between the United States and neighboring Mexico, whereas it differs so little between the United States and Germany or Japan?6  \n\n![](images/d88e8620d2985dffdc9b20a862c0ce73f594dcfc89c289f7bf356188be91799d.jpg)  \nF1G. 2.—Employee compensation share of GDP, 81 countries, most recent years available (1987-92). Sources: Employee compensation shares are taken from United Nations (1994); data on real per capita GDP are taken from the Penn World Tables, version 5.6.  \n\nA second possibility is that the aggregate technology displays a nonunitary elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. If this is the case, though, then the time-series data pose a puzzle: Why have employee compensation shares remained so stable over time, even as accumulation has changed relative factor prices?  \n\nA third possibility is that factor markets are noncompetitive in some countries and that factors are not paid their marginal products. In principle, this could certainly account for the data that we observe. Suppose, for example, that capital owners had market power in poor countries. This would tend to increase the share of national income accruing to the owners of capital. But it is hard to place much credence in a story like this in a world of increasingly mobile capital.  \n\nA fourth possibility is that measurement is poor or, more precisely, that employee compensation shares are a poor measure of labor shares. This is the explanation that I shall pursue in the remainder of the paper. Following Kravis (1962), we can conceive of two potential sources of variation in the functional distribution of income across countries. First, the disparities in employee compensation shares may reflect changes in the sectoral composition of output. Second, these disparities may reflect changes in the structure of employment—especially in the importance of self-employment. Either of these long-term trends could lead us to mismeasure or misinterpret the labor share of GDP.  \n\n### II1. Recalculating Labor Shares  \n\nFirst, consider how changes in the sectoral composition of output could lead us to misinterpret the data. Suppose that all countries have the same technology, but within each country, different sectors face different technologies. Then changes in the composition of output—such as the secular decline in agriculture's importance as economies grow—might lead to differences in factor shares.  \n\nNext, consider the possibility that changes in the importance of selfemployment are responsible for the observed patterns in employee compensation shares. As noted above, it is common practice to use employee compensation as a measure of labor income. From a conceptual perspective, however, employee compensation differs from labor income. Employee compensation excludes some important forms of nonwage compensation and may include rents accruing to particular skills, including returns to entrepreneurial ability. More important for the purposes of this paper, employee compensation omits the labor income of people who are not employees. In some countries, the self-employed account for huge fractions of the workforce. As a result, in these countries, labor income is badly understated by the employee compensation measure.  \n\nThe two phenomena described above are related but distinct. For example, agriculture generally has very low employee compensation shares—partly because it is dominated almost everywhere by the selfemployed and by small family businesses. The declining importance of agriculture as economies grow has a double effect on observed factor shares: output moves into sectors that are more labor-intensive, and a larger share of income is earned by workers as opposed to entrepreneurs. For analytic clarity, however, it is useful to consider the effects of the two phenomena separately.  \n\nFor 41 countries, the 1992 U.N. National Account Statistics include comparable data on the functional distribution of income—the cost components of GDP—by sector. First, note that across sectors, factor shares vary widely. In the United States, the employee compensation shares of value added in agriculture and mining are, respectively, only .212 and .361, whereas the employee compensation share in manufacturing is .732 and the share in “community, social, and personal services\" is .751. Similar patterns are observed for other countries. In general, agriculture and primary commodity production have low employee compensation shares, whereas manufacturing and services have relatively high employee compensation shares.  \n\nUnsurprisingly, the data also reveal substantial differences in the sectoral composition of output. For example, agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing together account for .023 of U.S. GDP, whereas in Burkina Faso the same sectors account for .526 of GDP. Finance, insurance, real estate, and business services accounted for .27 of U.S. GDP in 1986, whereas the same sectors accounted for .04l of Rwandan GDP. Could changes in the sectoral composition of output account for cross-country differences in employee compensation shares? For example, does the declining importance of agriculture—a sector with generally low employee compensation shares—account for the higher aggregate employee compensation shares found in rich countries? The answer is surprising: Almost certainly, the changing sectoral composition of GDP does not account for observed differences in income shares. The evidence comes from the following exercise.  \n\nSuppose that all countries had the same sectoral composition of output, differing only in within-sector factor shares. Then we could compute overall income shares that would reflect only the within-sector differences in factor shares. Table 1 shows the results of this experiment. For the 41 countries for which data were available, employee compensation shares were computed in two ways: first, on the basis of the current sectoral composition of output in each country and, second, reweighted according to the sectoral composition of output currently prevailing in the United States. The data in table 1 show that when sectoral composition of output is reweighted using the sectoral composition of the United States, overall employee compensation shares change very little. For a handful of poor countriessuch as Botswana, Libya, and Rwanda—there are significant increases in employee compensation, but they are nowhere near large enough to account for the overall differences among countries.?  \n\nTABLE1EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION SHARE OF GDP, 41 COUNTRIES,AT CURRENT SECTORALCOMPOSITION OF OUTPUT AND REWEIGHTED BY U.S.SECTORAL COMPOSITION OFOUTPUT  \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Country</td><td>Year</td><td>Current Sectoral Composition of Output*</td><td>Weighted by U.S. Sectoral Composition of Output</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>1986</td><td>.547</td><td>.538</td></tr><tr><td>Benin</td><td>1986</td><td>.160</td><td>.188</td></tr><tr><td>Botswana</td><td>1983</td><td>.301</td><td>.408</td></tr><tr><td>Burkina Faso</td><td>1984</td><td>.129</td><td>.392</td></tr><tr><td>Cameroon</td><td>1984</td><td>.228</td><td>.327</td></tr><tr><td>Chile</td><td>1982</td><td>.367</td><td>.373</td></tr><tr><td>Colombia</td><td>1984</td><td>.408</td><td>.386</td></tr><tr><td>Costa Rica</td><td>1984</td><td>.446</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>1986</td><td>.526</td><td>.512</td></tr><tr><td>Ecuador</td><td>1986</td><td>.160</td><td>.270</td></tr><tr><td>Fiji</td><td>1985</td><td>.436</td><td>.443</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>1986</td><td>.644</td><td>.647</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>1984</td><td>.542</td><td>.528</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Germany (Fed-</td></tr><tr><td>eral Republic)</td><td>1985</td><td>.513</td><td>.489</td></tr><tr><td>Hungary</td><td>1986</td><td>.443</td><td>.441</td></tr><tr><td>Iraq</td><td>1985</td><td>.203</td><td>.215</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>1985</td><td>.500</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jamaica</td><td>1986</td><td>.401</td><td>.423</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>1986</td><td>.523</td><td>.491</td></tr><tr><td>Kenya</td><td>1984</td><td>.309</td><td>.426</td></tr><tr><td>Korea</td><td>1985</td><td>.393</td><td>.423</td></tr><tr><td>Libya</td><td>1980</td><td>.163</td><td>.314</td></tr><tr><td>Malta Mauritius</td><td>1986</td><td>.424</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1985</td><td>.399</td><td>.358</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>1984</td><td>.491</td><td>.512</td></tr><tr><td>New Zealand</td><td>1985</td><td>.454</td><td>.455</td></tr><tr><td>Norway</td><td>1986</td><td>.516</td><td>.556</td></tr><tr><td>Peru</td><td>1985</td><td>.197</td><td>.217</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>1981</td><td>.476</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Rwanda</td><td>1985</td><td>.208</td><td>.313</td></tr><tr><td>Sierra Leone</td><td>1985</td><td>.195</td><td>.270</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>1984</td><td>.416</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sri Lanka</td><td>1986</td><td>.493</td><td>.575</td></tr><tr><td>Sudan</td><td>1983</td><td>.315</td><td>.313</td></tr><tr><td>Swaziland</td><td>1983</td><td>.433</td><td>.474</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden Trinidad and</td><td>1986</td><td>.572</td><td>.556</td></tr><tr><td>Tobago</td><td>1985</td><td>.495</td><td>.585</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>1986</td><td>.544</td><td>.538</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>1986</td><td>.589</td><td>.588</td></tr><tr><td>Venezuela</td><td>1985</td><td>.326</td><td>.349</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Zimbabwe</td><td>1984</td><td>.552</td><td>.528</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSoURCE.—United Nations (1991). \\*Employee compensation $\\div$ (employeecompensation $^{+}$ operatingsurplus $^+$ consumption of fixed capital), all sectors. + Not available because shares cannot be computed for all sectors.  \n\n![](images/9019e28a61433d981be3fa3bfabd9b6f326e69d79fc212e207f6bfe308be4fdb.jpg)  \nF1G. 3.—Employers and own-account workers as a share of the total workforce, by real per capita GDP, for all 50 countries with available data (approximately 1992). Source: International Labour Organization (1993). Date on real per capita GDP are taken from the Penn World Tables, version 5.6.  \n\nClearly, even within sectors, there are important differences across countries in employee compensation shares. For example, employee compensation shares in the manufacturing sector range from .749 in Finland to .132 in Ecuador. Most likely this reflects structural changes in the nature of firms and the size and scale of production. Thus changes in the sectoral composition of output may not be the most important source of disparities in observed income shares.  \n\n#### B. Adjusting for Self-Employment Income  \n\nRates of self-employment vary widely across countries. Even within sectors, there are large differences across countries, as shown by Gollin (1996). In Ghana, Bangladesh, and Nigeria, for example, 75-80 percent of manufacturing workers were self-employed, compared with fewer than 2 percent in the United States (International Labour Organization 1993).8 Figure 3 shows that rates of self-employment differ widely across countries and that these rates are closely related to real per capita GDP.  \n\nAccording to the U.N. System of National Accounts, adopted in 1953, the income of the self-employed is specifically not to be counted as employee compensation. Instead, this income——typically a mix of capital and labor income, along with rents to certain types of skills-is to be treated as a form of business income. Employee compensation is precisely the total compensation of people who work as employees. (See the Appendix for a more formal definition.)  \n\nThe usual approach of using employee compensation as a measure of labor income is thus explicitly omitting the labor income of the selfemployed. If this income is mistakenly counted as capital income—as in the usual approach of treating employee compensation as a measure of labor income—then this will tend systematically to underestimate the labor shares of poor countries relative to rich countries.? Unfortunately, it is not obvious how to remedy this problem. For most countries, I do not have data on the total income of the self-employed, much less on how to allocate this income between labor and capital.10  \n\nPerhaps the best approach is that ofYoung (1995), who imputed wages to the self-employed in Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea on the basis of their sector, sex, age, and education. On the basis of this set of estimates, Young computed labor shares for both countries. There are problems with this procedure, of course: it is difficult to control for unobservable differences in entrepreneurial ability, and it is difficult to know how to treat returns to entrepreneurial ability. Moreover, it requires detailed micro data, which makes it difficult to do for a large sample of countries. Nonetheless, Young's approach gives a plausible way of estimating labor shares in economies with large numbers of selfemployed people.11  \n\nAn alternative approach is to make adjustments to the NIPA based on the reported operating surplus of private unincorporated enterprises (OSPUE). Most of the income of the self-employed will fall into this category. Unless the self-employed receive wages from their own enterprises or unless individuals incorporate their own enterprises, the U.N. System of National Accounts would in principle treat all the proceeds from an unincorporated enterprise as operating surplus. Particularly in developing countries, almost no self-employed people will be legally incorporated. Thus essentially all the income from their enterprises —capital income and labor income, as well as any rents or returns to other factors--will be reported as OSPUE.12 I consider three possible adjustments to NIPA that involve reallocating OSPUE between labor and capital.  \n\nThe first adjustment would be to treat all the OsPUE as labor income.13 This has the virtue of being a straightforward adjustment, and in many poor countries it could be argued that the self-employed are providing almost pure labor services. The disadvantage of this approach is that—even in poor countries—the self-employed tend to have substantial amounts of capital in their businesses. Thus this adjustment overstates the labor share of national income.  \n\nThe second adjustment would be to treat OsPUE as comprising the same mix of labor and capital income as the rest of the economy. Thus we assume that labor and capital shares are approximately the same in private unincorporated enterprises (PUEs) as they are in large corporations and the government sector.14 The advantage to this approach is that it is simple and transparent, and it makes sense to assume that OSPUE includes some capital income as well as some labor income. The disadvantage of this approach is that it implicitly assumes that income shares are the same for establishments that differ significantly in size and structure. This might not be a good assumption for several reasons. First, PUEs might be more common in some sectors than in others, and as noted above, income shares differ widely by sector. Second, within a particular sector, PUEs might tend to be more laborintensive (or perhaps more capital-intensive) than corporations.  \n\nA third adjustment focuses on imputing employee compensation for those workers who are self-employed. For countries with available data on the composition of the workforce, it is possible to compute average employee compensation by dividing NIPA employee compensation by the number of employees. We can then scale this up for the entire workforce by multiplying average employee compensation by the number of people in the workforce. The result could be thought of as total labor income.15 The advantage of this approach is that it attempts to take into account the fraction of self-employed people in different countries. Instead of guessing at how to divide up OsPUE between labor and capital, this adjustment uses additional information to estimate the total labor share in the economy. This adjustment will be good to the extent that the self-employed command essentially the same wages as people who work as employees. It will be a poor assumption if there are systematic differences in earning ability between employees and the self-employed.16  \n\nAll three adjustments will tend to overstate the labor share of national income in countries in which officials have already sought to adjust the data for the labor income of the self-employed. Young (2000) suggests that such adjustments are made in China and some other countries (e.g., Taiwan and Korea), contrary to the U.N. System of National Accounts. For many of the countries in the data, however, this does not appear to be a problem.17 And to the extent that output and income from self-employment are underreported in the national income accounts, there may be undercounting of labor income as well.  \n\nTable 2 shows the results of the three adjustments for all 31 countries for which data were available on the operating surplus of private unincorporated enterprises. The third adjustment can be computed only for a subset of 19 countries with contemporaneous data on the number of employees in the workforce. Thus the data do not permit a full comparison with all the countries for which the employee compensation share can be calculated. Nonetheless, the results are suggestive. For the 31 countries, the “naive\" calculation, which simply gives the employee compensation share of GDP, yields widely varied results, ranging from .201 for Burundi to .770 for Ukraine. The mean is .472, with a standard deviation of .137. All three of the adjustments give higher mean values for labor shares, with much lower variance across countries. Table 3 summarizes the means and standard deviations for the “naive” calculation and the three proposed adjustments. Since Botswana appears to be an outlier, table 3 also shows how mean values and standard deviations change when Botswana is omitted.  \n\nA quick glance at the data in tables 2 and 3 reveals that adjustments 1 and 2 appear to resurrect the hypothesis that factor shares are constant across countries. With either adjustment, it appears that labor shares are quite stable across countries, regardless of the levels of income per capita. Moreover, these shares cluster in a range from .60 to .85, depending on which adjustment is used.1\" This is precisely the range in which time-series values for the United States and United Kingdom tend to fall, lending some support to the idea that the cross-section and timeseries values are essentially consistent.  \n\nTABLE2 ALTERNATIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO NAIVE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION SHARE, INTENDED TO CAPTUREINCOME OFSELF-EMPLOYED ANDPROPRIETORS   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Year</td><td>Real per Capita GDP</td><td>Naive Calculation</td><td>Adjustment 1</td><td>Adjustment 2</td><td>Adjustment 3</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td></td><td></td><td>.504</td><td>.719</td><td>.669</td><td>.676</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>1992 1992</td><td>14,458</td><td>.417</td><td>.554</td><td>.514</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Belarus</td><td>1992</td><td>13,484</td><td>.547</td><td>.791</td><td>.743</td><td>.740*</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium Bolivia</td><td>1988</td><td>1,670</td><td>.256</td><td>.835</td><td>.627</td><td>.484t</td></tr><tr><td>Botswana</td><td>1986</td><td>2,662</td><td>.302</td><td>.368</td><td>.341</td><td>.484t</td></tr><tr><td>Burundi</td><td>1986</td><td>551</td><td>.201</td><td>.914</td><td>.728</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Congo</td><td>1988</td><td>2,340</td><td>.372</td><td>.691</td><td>.578</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ecuador</td><td>1986</td><td>2,885</td><td>.213</td><td>.820</td><td>.571</td><td>.502*</td></tr><tr><td>Estonia</td><td>1991</td><td></td><td>.469</td><td>.606</td><td>.574</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>1992</td><td>12,000</td><td>.575</td><td>.765</td><td>.734</td><td>.680</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>1992</td><td>13,918</td><td>.525</td><td>.764</td><td>.717</td><td>.681t</td></tr><tr><td>Hungary</td><td>1991</td><td>4,947</td><td>.585</td><td>.802</td><td>.772</td><td>.675</td></tr><tr><td>India</td><td>1980</td><td>882</td><td>.691</td><td>.838</td><td>.828</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>1991</td><td>12,602</td><td>.451</td><td>.804</td><td>.717</td><td>.707t</td></tr><tr><td>Ivory Coast</td><td>1977</td><td>2,060</td><td>.287</td><td>.809</td><td>.690</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jamaica</td><td>1988</td><td>2,443</td><td>.427</td><td>.616</td><td>.566</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>1992</td><td>15,105</td><td>.564</td><td>.727</td><td>.692</td><td>.725</td></tr><tr><td>Korea</td><td>1991</td><td>7,251</td><td>.472</td><td>.768</td><td>.697</td><td>.796</td></tr><tr><td>Latvia</td><td>1992</td><td></td><td>.374</td><td>.550</td><td>.471</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Malta</td><td>1990</td><td>6,627</td><td>.434</td><td>.714</td><td>.632</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mauritius</td><td>1990</td><td>5,838</td><td>.392</td><td>.767</td><td>.668</td><td>.490*</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>1992</td><td>13,281</td><td>.532</td><td>.721</td><td>.680</td><td>.643t</td></tr><tr><td>Norway</td><td>1991</td><td>15,047</td><td>.519</td><td>.678</td><td>.643</td><td>.569*</td></tr><tr><td>Philippines</td><td>1992</td><td>1,689</td><td>.353</td><td>.800</td><td>.661</td><td>.872</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>1990</td><td>7,478</td><td>.448</td><td>.825</td><td>.748</td><td>.602</td></tr><tr><td>Reunion</td><td>1989</td><td>2,988</td><td>.595</td><td>.832</td><td>.799</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>1992</td><td>13,986</td><td>.613</td><td>.800</td><td>.774</td><td>.723*</td></tr><tr><td>Ukraine</td><td>1991</td><td></td><td>.770</td><td>.797</td><td>.762</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>1992</td><td>12,724</td><td>.574</td><td>.815</td><td>.782</td><td>.719</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>1992</td><td>17,945</td><td>.604</td><td>.773</td><td>.743</td><td>.664</td></tr><tr><td>Vietnam</td><td>1989</td><td></td><td>.594</td><td>.835</td><td>.802</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSoURCE.-Data on real GDP per capita are taken from the Penn World Tables, version 5.6.

In contrast to the data for the naive approach, which are shown in figure 2, the scatter plots for the adjusted data display surprisingly low variance and are relatively flat. The variance is in general higher for poor countries than for rich countries, suggesting perhaps that data quality may be a problem in the poor countries. Certainly, there is nothing in figures 4 and 5 to suggest that there are systematic differences between rich and poor countries in factor shares.  \n\nTABLE3 MEAN LABOR SHARES AND STANDARD DEVIATION ACROSS COUNTRIES FOR NAIVE CALCULATIONANDTHREEADJUSTMENTS   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>NaiveCalculation</td><td>Adjustment 1</td><td>Adjustment 2</td><td>Adjustment3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">AllCountries</td></tr><tr><td>Meanlaborshare</td><td>.472</td><td>.745</td><td>.675</td><td>.654</td></tr><tr><td>Standarddeviation</td><td>.137</td><td>.110</td><td>.107</td><td>.109</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">ExcludingBotswana</td></tr><tr><td>Meanlaborshare</td><td>.479</td><td>.758</td><td>.686</td><td>.664</td></tr><tr><td>Standarddeviation</td><td>.135</td><td>.087</td><td>.089</td><td>.103</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSoURcE.—Based on calculations shown in table 2.  \n\nAdjustment 3, which computes labor shares on the basis of average employee compensation, also yields relatively flat results, although the data are available for a smaller number of countries (see fig. 6). Here, too, the remaining variation in factor shares is not obviously linked to income per capita.  \n\n### IV.   Conclusions and Implications  \n\nThe main finding of this paper is that simple and straightforward adjustments to the usual calculations of factor shares give estimates that are remarkably consistent with the claim that factor shares are approximately constant across time and space. The usual “naive\" calculation of labor shares—using employee compensation as a fraction of GDP —makes an obvious and important error in failing to account for labor income of the self-employed and other entrepreneurs. Labor force data suggest that this error may be particularly important in poor countries, where small enterprises and self-employment account for large fractions of the workforce. Three possible corrections are considered. All three adjustments result in greater uniformity of estimated labor shares across countries. In particular, the first two adjustments give estimated labor shares that are essentially flat across countries and over time. This finding has implications for research in trade and growth theory. It has become widely accepted, in recent years, that labor shares are lower in poor countries than in rich countries. This has led to numerous ad hoc adjustments in growth models and trade models. This paper suggests that, for many analyses, it is reasonable to use models that give rise to constant factor shares. At a more applied level, country-specific studies—such as applied general equilibrium models used to analyze trade or policy reform—should take care to compute factor shares in ways that take into account the labor income of entrepreneurs and the earnings of the self-employed. Estimates of factor shares that do not account for self-employment income will be seriously flawed, especially in poor countries.  \n\n![](images/a33957f7c26c537d382bd0e5a960071e5e4d2a96ffeed1771d2ec5f9eeef3a05.jpg)  \nF1G. 4.—Estimates of labor share, using adjustment 1 to account for income of selfemployed and proprietors, combined pooled cross-country and time-series data.

System of National Accounts  \n\nThe categories and descriptions are condensed from notes in United Nations (1994, chap. 1).  \n\nCompensation of employees.—-Includes wages and salaries (cash and in-kind), commissions, bonuses, tips, cost of living adjustments, vacation, and sick leave allowances. Also includes employer contributions to social security programs and pension schemes, employer contributions to insurance funds, employers' paid and imputed contributions to pensions, family allowances, layoff and severance pay, health plans, and other benefit packages.  \n\nOperating surplus.—Defined as a residual: the amount by which value added exceeds the sum of compensation of employees, consumption of fixed capital, and net indirect taxes.  \n\nIndirect taxes.—Taxes chargeable to the cost of production or sale of goods or services. They include export and import duties; excise, sales, entertainment, and turnover taxes; real estate and land taxes; value-added taxes and taxes on the employment of labor; certain fees paid by producers; and operating surplus of certain kinds of government monopolies (e.g., tobacco or alcohol), which is in principle reduced for the “normal\" profits of similar business units.  \n\nSubsidies.—Grants on current account by the government to private enterprises and public corporations, or to unincorporated public enterprises when clearly intended to compensate for losses associated with government price policies.  \n\nConsumption of fixed capital.—Includes allowances for normal wear and tear, foreseen obsolescence, and predictable unrepairable damage to capital, all valued at current replacement cost.  \n\n### References  \n\nCobb, Charles W., and Douglas, Paul H. “A Theory of Production.\" A.E.R.

The Heterogeneous Effects of Buyouts on Job Qualit!  \n\nFebruary 8, 2022  \n\n# Abstract  \n\nWe show that private equity leveraged buyouts (LBOs) reduce perceived job quality despite not impacting average base pay. This appears to reflect higher risk for employees. Both job quality and employee incentive pay are more related to firm performance at private equity-owned companies than at public control firms, with $1\\%$ higher deal IRR associated with $0.7\\%$ more employee incentive pay. Also, higher leverage deals and employees with worse outside options and longer tenure drive the post-LBO satisfaction declines. Our results highlight how job quality is tied to job security and how ownership affects employees through mechanisms beyond base pay.  \n\nKeywords: private equity, leveraged buyouts, job quality, employees, corporate culture, non-pecuniary amenities, implicit contracts  \n\nJEL: G24, G32, J31, J32  \n\nA worker's relationship with her employer involves far more than money. Company culture, commitment to work-life balance, and management are central to job quality but do not show up on a paycheck. Although employees at larger firms may never meet the firm owners, a growing literature has linked employee outcomes to ownership structure. In this paper, we explore the impact of private equity (PE) ownership on job quality.  \n\nPE has a large footprint on the US economy, accounting for more than one-third of recent M&A transactions.2 The asset class has delivered strong financial returns to both investors and fund managers.3 These returns come from a combination of operational and capital structure changes.4 Although PE deals generate value for owners, their effect on employees - among a firm's most important stakeholders - is far from clear. One hypothesis is that PE investors create value in part by extracting surplus from employees by cutting amenities, reducing job security, and increasing demands on workers. Consistent with this, media reports highlight layoffs and oppressive working conditions after PE buyouts. Under that model, returns to investors come at the expense of employee well-being. An alternative is that the actions PE owners take to improve firm value might make employees happier. This could arise if PE owners relax capital constraints and allow needed investments (Boucly, Sraer, and Thesmar, 2011; Krishnan, Nandy, and Puri, 2015), turn around struggling firms (Johnston-Ross, Ma, and Puri, 2021; Cohn, Hotchkiss, and Towery, 2021), or perhaps even make active investments in employees which were forgone by myopic or capital-constrained prior owners (Edmans, 2011; Welch and Yoon, 2020).  \n\nWe test and help reconcile these contrasting predictions. We ask how buyouts affect employee perceptions of job quality, including not just compensation but also non-pecuniary amenities, and examine how any effects differ across both deal and employee types. To do so, we use employee reviews from the website Glassdoor and focus on dimensions that speak to the crucial intangibles of the employer-employee relationship: satisfaction with compensation, work-life balance, culture, and senior management, along with reported base salary and variable (i.e. performance) pay. We merge the Glassdoor firms to PE deals from Pitchbook and M&A transactions from Capital IQ. We further match the PE transactions to deal-level returns data from Stepstone, a large fund of funds. Our analysis dataset includes over three million reviews of jobs by employees currently working at 271,000 unique companies posted between 2008 and 2019.  \n\nEmployee review data offer several advantages over more standard datasets.  First, understanding job quality requires eliciting the opinions of workers themselves, who, as Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2015) point out, offer a ground truth on firm culture that does not always align with how the firm advertises its own culture. Second, our data shed new light on earnings relative to administrative datasets such as those available at the U.s. Census Bureau.  The Glassdoor measures cover all compensation, including equity, both via reported salary and incentive pay. Third, our data allow us to measure not just pay but also the satisfaction with that pay, which is arguably most relevant for welfare. Existing research has validated Glassdoor employee review data, showing that it is informative about firm outcomes and representative of the U.S. wage distribution.6  \n\nOur research design is a differences-in-differences model, using firm and industry-time fixed effects with never-PE-owned firms serving as controls. Although this design is common, it faces two identification challenges: selection of targets by PE firms, and selection of employees into leaving reviews.  We address the firm selection concern in four ways.  First, dynamic differences-in-differences event studies describe whether target firms appear to be on track towards the changes we observe. These show no pre-trends and a discontinuous change after the buyout. Second, we conduct a falsification test with canceled deals, which show no effects, suggesting that unobservable firm characteristics attracting PE investors do not drive our results. More generally, we show the observables that PE firms target do not drive our results. Third, most of our results are across deal or employee characteristics, which addresses many selection stories. Fourth, we show that our results survive a host of robustness checks, such as a matching estimator.  \n\nNonetheless, PE firms clearly do not pick targets at random. Our causality argument focuses on treatment effects for the treated, rather than externally validity to a random firm in the economy. We show that treated firms were not on track to the outcomes we observe and would have continued, at least in the medium term, on their pre-existing path in the absence of the LBO. This interpretation is important for social welfare as PE expands its footprint in the economy; even to the degree that target firms “need\" LBOs because they are mismanaged, we shed light on how employee wellbeing relates to value creation in PE.  \n\nEmployee selection is the second challenge. People visit the Glassdoor website for a reason, namely to read and write company reviews. Our key assumption is that whatever makes a person write a review at an LBO target is the same as what makes them write a review at a control firm. To mitigate the influence of selection, we consider only reviews by current employees, limiting bias from laid-off employees. We also aggregate reviews to company-quarter averages, which addresses potential buyout-induced changes in the number of reviewers. Beyond that, we show that changes in the number and composition of reviewers around the buyout are in practice small and insignificant, and our results are not driven by changes in either tail of the distribution. Fortunately, the structure of the Glassdoor site is designed to generate quality reviews, both because reviews are anonymous, which reduces any incentive to misrepresent, and because Glassdoor requires contributing a review in order to view reviews on the platform, which reduces both selection bias and the polarization inherent in online reviews (Marinescu et al., 2018).  \n\nWe show that after an LBO, employee satisfaction with compensation declines by 0.083 points on a one-to-five scale, with a slightly larger negative effect on satisfaction with firm culture and slightly smaller negative effects on satisfaction with work-life balance and senior management. This relationship is economically meaningful. For example, it is $57\\%$ larger than the reported compensation satisfaction gap between reviewers in college degree-requiring jobs and those in high school-requiring jobs. We also find discontinuous increases in the usage of terms such as 'cost-cutting’ and ‘uncertainty’ around the deal data, providing support for both causality and specific operational mechanisms. However, despite significant declines in reported satisfaction with compensation, we can rule out large decreases in average pay.  \n\nOne important mechanism for the decline in satisfaction with compensation is higher risk. LBOs increase the risk employees face through several channels, ranging from higher-powered incentives to dramatically higher firm leverage. First, LBOs lead to large increases in managerial incentive pay. These increases are consistent with research showing manager incentives are a key part of value creation (Gompers, Kaplan, and Mukharlyamov, 2016).  \n\nSecond, higher leverage deals have far more negative effects on job quality along all dimensions, with moderate-to-no effect for relatively low leverage deals. The strong relationship for leverage contrasts with weak relationships for other deal characteristics such as size and deal type (public-to-private, corporate divestiture, and vanilla). Leverage is also more important than whether a deal was associated with large one-time layoffs, which we examine using a novel panel of LinkedIn profile information collected specifically for our target firms. While there is evidence of significant one-time layoffs at the time of many buyouts, both the satisfaction and leverage results appear independent of layoffs. Although we cannot identify a causal effect of leverage, we document that following public firm recapitalizations, a situation outside PE where firms quickly take on large amounts of new debt while simultaneously buying back shares or issuing large dividends, we also see satisfaction with compensation decreasing in new leverage.  \n\nThird, we document an increase in the degree to which firm returns are passed through to employees. Our use of deal-level cash flows from StepStone's SPI database makes us, to our knowledge, the first paper to link PE returns to employee welfare. The best-performing PE deals are associated with happier employees across dimensions, implying that the returns in these deals are not earned at the expense of employees. Although base pay remains flat, a $1\\%$ higher deal IRR mapsto $0.7\\%$ more incentive pay. This aligns with previous literature showing firm performance to be positively associated with employee satisfaction (Verwijmeren and Derwall, 2010; Edmans, 2011; Bae, Kang, and Wang, 2011; Edmans, Li, and Zhang, 2014; Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales, 2015; Green et al., 2019). Digging deeper, we show that the performance satisfaction relationship is three times stronger for PE targets than for public firms. This suggests employees at LBO targets are dramatically more exposed to the firm's fortunes. Although they are strongly correlated ex-post, employee pre-deal satisfaction levels do not robustly predict investor returns.  \n\nWe connect our results to models of ownership structure and employee-firm risk sharing such as Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010). In these models, firms commit to low leverage and stable pay for employees in order to attract talent. Ex-post, firms may have an incentive to fire employees, increase leverage, or otherwise default on that commitment. Through the lens of the Shleifer and Summers (1988) breach-of-implicit-contract mechanism, PE firms′ actions to increase employee risk bearing may be responding to that incentive by reneging on those implicit contracts. We test the predictions of this mechanism. First, greater risk can explain the reduction in pay satisfaction with no reduction in pay; employees view the loss of stability as a real cost and demand compensating wage differentials. Second, we show the effects are entirely driven by longer-tenure, pre-deal hires, who presumably were the former beneficiaries of any implicit guarantees. Third, we show effects are strongest among workers with the largest costs of unemployment, such as those in high unemployment industries.  \n\nThis paper contributes to the literature on the conflicts of interest between labor and capital (Atanassov and Kim, 2009). We show for the first time how ownership changes affect workers' non-pecuniary amenities and perception of firm culture. While the literature has separately studied how corporate ownership structures affect firm outcomes (e.g. Maksimovic and Phillips (2008), Cremers, Nair, and John (2009), Bena and Li (2014)) and the importance of culture, management, and other non-wage amenities (e.g. Levit and Malenko (2016)), rarely have they been examined together. Our findings are consistent with the conclusion of Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2015) that “a focus towards shareholders’ value-maximization undermines the ability of a company to sustain a high level of integrity capital,’ because LBOs imply a transition to higher-powered incentives to maximize short-term profit (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2009). Related work that touches more broadly on employee welfare around acquisitions or takeovers includes Pontiff, Shleifer, and Weisbach (1990), Pagano and Volpin (2005), John, Knyazeva, and Knyazeva (2015), and Dessaint, Golubov, and Volpin (2017).  \n\nOur paper joins studies of how PE ownership affects workers, which includes Boucly, Sraer, and Thesmar (2011) and Davis et al. (2014) on the number of employees, Cohn, Nestoriak, and Wardlaw (2021) on workplace safety, Olsson and Tag (2017) on unemployment incidence at LBO targets in Sweden, Fang, Goldman, and Roulet (2021) on wage gaps at LBO targets in France, and Antoni, Maug, and Obernberger (2019) on employment and wages at LBO targets in Germany. Our paper extends this work in at least four ways. First, we shed new light on the importance of non-pecuniary amenities such as employees’ perceptions of firm culture. Non-pecuniary job amenities are an important but largely unstudied and not fully priced dimension of the economy (Mas and Pallais, 2017; Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo, 2017; Lamadon, Mogstad, and Setzler, 2019). Second, our performance pay measure includes stock option grants and other types of variable pay. Third, we study the real effects of U.s. buyouts on a large and representative sample. As Morris and Phalippou (2020) note, the literature on PE ownership has generally used small and selected samples restricted to a single industry or European country with markedly different labor laws from the U.S. Finally, we shed light on the important role of risk sharing. In contemporaneous work, Lambert, Moreno, Phalippou, and Scivoletto (2021) also study PE and employee satisfaction, but focus on the role of public-to-private transactions, PE firm fixed effects, and the relationship between scores and comment text. Finally, this paper is also related to the growing emphasis that institutional investors place on ESG (Barber, Morse, and Yasuda, 2021; Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo, 2017), one component of which is employee well-being.  \n\n### Data Sources and Summary Statistics  \n\nWe take data from several sources. Employee-level job quality variables are from Glassdoor reviews. The companies in Glassdoor are matched to PE deals from Pitchbook, employment histories from LinkedIn, and investor returns from Stepstone. We use CRSP return data, CapitalIQ M&A deals, Compustat accounting data, and Preqin ESG data for supplemental analysis.  \n\nEmployee Review  Data.  We begin  with comprehensive employee review data from Glassdoor.com between the platform's January 2008 inception and 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic. These data cover almost all major companies and contain measures of employee satisfaction and reported pay and benefits, as well as the reviewer's job title, tenure, employment status, and location. Figure 1 offers an example of one of the reviews that composes the underlying data. We hover the mouse over the overall rating (a two out of a maximum of five) to view the dimension ratings. This reviewer gave Dell a one on Career Opportunities but a four on Compensation & Benefits.  \n\nWhy do people review on Glassdoor? They are likely usually searching for jobs, though they may also simply be interested in knowing more about their own company or another one. Glassdoor employs a give-to-get model, where a review must be entered in order to view the reviews on the website. This reduces the selection bias and polarization that are inherent in online reviews (Marinescu et al., 2018). Evidence of this is the fact that the distributions of the four ratings exhibit central tendency, shown in Appendix Figure A.1. For example, the mean Senior Management rating is 3.4 with a standard deviation of 1.4 (recall that the range is one to five).  \n\nNonetheless, reviewers are not randomly drawn from employees, a selection bias that poses a challenge to all survey-based papers. In our analysis, we make the key assumption that whatever makes a person write a review at an LBO target is the same as what makes them write a review at a control firm. We take several steps to test this assumption and ensure our results are robust to violations of it. First, we address potential variation in the number of reviews at a company over time by performing analysis at the company-quarter level or the company-quarter-cohort level (for example, long-tenured employees at a firm in a quarter). Second, we drop former employees, the most obvious source of bias, although our results persist in that cohort. Third, most of our analysis focuses on heterogeneity interactions, which mitigates concerns about selection, since we are, for example, comparing longer- to shorter-tenured workers at a PE-target relative to that same gap at a non-target. Fourth, we replicate our key analysis with controls for key observable employee characteristics. Finally, in practice, we do not see significant changes in the number or composition of workers giving reviews around buyouts (discussed below).  \n\nMuch of the existing research on how PE affects employees uses administrative sources, in particular the employee-employer panels available at the U.s. Census Bureau and similar institutions in other countries. The major advantage of these sources is that they do not face the problem of selection into reviewing. However, employee reviews and Glassdoor data specifically offer insights that are not available elsewhere, and in fact address precisely the weaknesses of traditional administrative data. First, they shed light on corporate culture and other non-pecuniary amenities, which are completely absent from Census data. Second, they contain information about performance pay, including stock compensation and benefits, while Census contains only base salaries. Third, observations are identified by the day and thus are “real time’ while the Census wage data are annual. Fourth, we observe granular occupation data, while the Census data lack occupation information. Finally, Glassdoor data may be linked to proprietary information such as our deal-level returns data, while Census data are tightly sequestered.  \n\nIn using the Glassdoor data, we consider only U.s.-based current employees of U.S. companies, yielding a final sample of 3,300,000 reviews from 271,000 companies.7 For these reviews, we focus primarily on seven dimensions. Four measure employee satisfaction with Compensation & Benefits, Culture & Values, Senior Management, and Work-Life Balance. We abbreviate the first two of these to “compensation” and “culture” for parsimony and because we find no effects on benefits when considered separately. These measures are quantified in numeric ratings, which range from one (worst) to five (best). The other three dimensions concern reported pay: base salary, variable pay, and an indicator for any variable pay. Variable pay, also called \"performance pay,” includes bonuses, stock options, profit-sharing plans, and sales commissions, all of which are reported separately. Table 1 Panel A summarizes these ratings. We present a correlation matrix across the seven measures (plus benefits ratings) in Appendix Table A.1; the dimensions are correlated with one another in intuitive ways, but they each contain independent information.8  \n\nExisting literature establishes that Glassdoor review data are both informative about firm outcomes and representative of the labor market, albeit somewhat skewed toward skilled occupations. Karabarbounis and Pinto (2018) show that the wage distribution of Glassdoor reviewers is consistent with external data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Sockin and Sockin (2019) show pay representativeness at the industry level, and Martellini, Schoellman, and Sockin (2021) document external validity of earnings using Department of Education college earnings data.  Comparing the average job satisfaction level between Glassdoor and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, Sockin (2021) finds statistically significant correlations of nearly one-half across industries and occupations. Glassdoor reviews predict stock returns (Green et al., 2019; Sheng, 2019), operating performance (Huang, Li, and Markov, 2020), and firm financing (Chemmanur, Rajaiya, and Sheng, 2019). Lee et al. (2020) show that the reviews react to corporate events such as scandals. In sum, we are confident that the ratings offer reasonably truthful information about the state of the company.  \n\nThe Glassdoor data include reviewers’ tenure and job title, which we use to infer reviewer characteristics. These are summarized in Table 1 Panel B. The data contain new hires and veteran employees, with $25\\%$ of employees working no more than one year at the firm, $29\\%$ one to three years, $19\\%$ three to five years, and $26\\%$ five or more. We infer workers′ roles using their reported job titles. Text matching reveals that one out of six has a job title identifying them as a manager. We merge job titles to OCC codes using the mapping in Atalay et al. (2020).? About $14\\%$ of the matched raters are in jobs that typically require no more than a year of work experience, while at the other end of the spectrum $23\\%$ are in jobs requiring more than five years of experience. The majority $(76\\%)$ are in jobs that typically require a college degree, while $18\\%$ are in jobs that do not and the remaining $6\\%$ are in jobs that require a Masters? or Professional degree. Finally, we use data from textual comments in the reviews, which we describe below.  \n\nWe construct company-quarter level variables using the review-level information. Although users can leave multiple reviews, the vast majority do not and so we abstract from reviewer identity. For the outcomes of satisfaction ratings, pay, and the textual indicators we take the average of reviews in the company quarter (the results are robust to using the median). For worker characteristics such as tenure or education, which we employ as right-hand-side variables for heterogeneity analysis, we split the sample at logical break points (e.g., jobs that require a college degree versus those that do not) and then calculate the average company-quarter level outcome separately for each group.  \n\nPE and Acquisition Deal Data.  To obtain PE deal information, we manually match Glassdoor firms to PE deal targets in the Pitchbook database. We focus on targets based in the U.S. with a transaction date between 2010 and 2016 that have Glassdoor reviews on either side of the deal. PitchBook is widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive PE databases and is especially strong for the U.s. data and the most recent decade. We drop non-U.S. deals, secondary transactions (where company ownership is transferred between two PE investors), PIPEs and other investments in companies that were not taken private, and debt-only deals. This gives us a total of 7,701 deals.  \n\nWithin this sample, we consider three mutually exclusive PE business models. The first is 3,572 leveraged buyouts (LBOs). In an LBO, a PE fund takes a controlling stake in the target company. The PE firm borrows most of the money needed to purchase the company, but it organizes the transaction so that the debt is placed on the target company's balance sheet. That is, the target company owes the money used to purchase it, not the PE fund. The second group is 484 management buyouts (MBOs). In an MBO, the existing managers of a company purchase a controlling interest with the help of a PE firm. MBOs typically increase company leverage as well, but tend to be in the lower part of the LBO leverage distribution.1o The third group is 2,934 growth equity investments. Growth equity is closer to venture capital but for later-stage companies, and involves the PE firm taking a non-controlling stake in a company. Here, the cash from the investment goes to the company rather than to selling shareholders. We retain only a company's first deal in each of these three groups. 11  \n\nOur main analysis focuses on LBOs, which are at a conceptual level the strongest PE treatment. We divide LBOs into three mutually exclusive categories based on Pitchbook's deal classification scheme: public-to-private deals, corporate divestitures, and ‘vanilla’ LBOs. In a public-to-private deal, PE investors purchase and take private a public company. Although small in number, these deals account for many of our reviews as the target companies tend to be large. Corporate divestitures occur when a PE firm acquires a subsidiary of a corporation, and either holds it as a standalone firm or rolls it into another existing company. They have significant cultural and management implications because they typically cause the corporate form to change from a diversified conglomerate to a more focused firm. We define a vanilla LBO as any other PE purchase of a standalone, privately held company.  \n\nWe matched 2,762 $(77\\%)$ of the qualifying LBOs to Glassdoor companies, 405 of the MBOs $(84\\%)$ , and 1,927 of the growth equity deals $(66\\%)$ . In our main analysis, we restrict to the 1,371 LBO, 178 MBO, and 700 growth equity deals within these matched samples that have at least one review by current employees in both pre- and post-deal periods. Table 1 Panel C provides summary statistics about the final sample of matched LBOs that are used in our analysis. Appendix Table A.2 contains summary statistics about the growth equity and MBO sample. Appendix Table A.3 compares deal characteristics across all Pitchbook deals, Glassdoor matched deals, and our analysis sample. The matched deals are reasonably representative of the full dataset. They have a similar industry breakdown; for example, $16\\%$ $(15\\%)$ of deals in our matched (full) sample are in healthcare.12 Figure 2 shows that the matched deals are distributed relatively uniformly across our sample period. Overall, we believe our data are among the most representative of PE's overall role in the U.S. economy that researchers studying operational outcomes have employed to date.  \n\nTo beter understand the role of employee departures around LBOs, we obtain LinkedIn data from the analytics firm LIX on all employees who ever worked for a subset of the LBO target companies. We restrict this research to the 618 targets in the LBO analysis sample that have both (a) at least five reviews; and (b) current employee reviews before and after the deal. We match  \n\n381 firms and record LinkedIn job titles and years for 457,087 of those firms’ employees. We use this to create a firm-year panel of departure and hiring rates. For example, the departure rate is the number of users reporting a final year of employment in year $t$ , divided by the number of users reporting employment at the company in year $t$ 13  \n\nInvestor Return Data.  We use investor return data from Stepstone Group, which has built its SPI database while providing fund-of-fund and advisory services in private markets since 2006. These data come from performing due diligence and monitoring investments, similar to other academic sources of deal-level PE return data (Robinson and Sensoy, 2013; Degeorge, Martin, and Phalippou, 2016; Braun, Jenkinson, and Stoff, 2017). Stepstone requires fund managers to report returns from all deals and reconcile them with fund-level performance, which mitigates the bias towards more successful deals that appears in some datasets. We use deal-level internal rate of return (IRR), total value multiple (TVM), and public market equivalents (PMEs), with the latter being calculated against the industry-specific Russell 2000 Indexes using reported cash fows following Kaplan and Schoar (2005). As with Glassdoor ratings, we measure returns at or before March 2020 to avoid the confounding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.14  \n\nWematch $26\\%$ (351) LBOs in our main sample to SPI, a proportion broadly consistent with SPI's coverage of the LBO universe. Summary statistics for the matched sample are reported in Panel D of Table 1. Relative to the Preqin database and SPI itself, the deals? returns range widely and appear representative.15  \n\nAdditional Data Sources. For supplemental analysis, we use data on stock returns from CRSP, data on conventional acquisitions from CapitalIQ, data on public firms from Compustat which we use to identify public debt recapitalizations, and data on funds from Preqin's ESG module. These are introduced where they are used.  \n\n## 2 Empirical Approach  \n\nWe are interested in the causal effect of LBOs on employee outcomes. The two major analytical challenges are non-random selection of targets by acquirers and non-random selection of employees into writing reviews. To address the first issue, we use a differences-in-differences design, test for pre-trends using an event study, test for targeting drivers, and conduct a falsification test with canceled deals. While there are likely unobservables that drive PE targeting, these steps support causality within the treated population. To address the second challenge, we construct measures at the company level, focus on cross-group heterogeneity, and test and control for composition changes in characteristics of interest.  \n\nOur baseline test is described by Equation (1) and is a differences-in-differences specification at the company-quarter level. The first difference compares targets before and after the buyout. The second difference compares targets to firms that were never PE-owned.  \n\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{j,q}=\\beta\\mathbb{1}(\\mathrm{Post}\\mathrm{Deal}_{j,q})+\\alpha_{j}+\\gamma_{n,q}+\\varepsilon_{j,q}.\n$$  \n\n$\\bar{Y}_{j,q}$ is the quarter $q$ average of a particular outcome for company $j$ in industry $n$ , such as the average compensation rating given to Dell Technologies in 2012Q3. The indicator variable $\\mathbb{1}(\\mathrm{Post}\\mathrm{Deal}_{j,q})$ is one if firm $j$ is PE-owned in quarter $q$ and zero if not. The coefficient of interest, $\\beta$ , captures the relationship between the PE ownership and $\\bar{Y}_{j,q}$ . We use company fixed effects $(\\alpha_{j})$ to control for cross-company differences and industry-quarter fixed effects $(\\gamma_{n,q})$ to control for industry-level time trends. We use only reviews from employees who report working for the firm at the time of their review.  \n\nTo understand how different types of employees are impacted, we construct company-by-quarter-by-cohort average outcomes, $\\bar{Y}_{j,q,c}$ , and test the interaction of the deal effect with the cohort characteristic. For example, to study short- vs. long-tenured employees, we calculate the average outcome at the company-quarter level separately for these two groups of employees. Then we use the model in Equation (2) to assess the interaction effect, where $X_{c}$ represents an indicator for whether the group is composed of short- or long-tenured employees and $\\delta$ , our coefficient of interest, represents the differential effect on that group.  \n\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{j,q,c}=\\delta\\mathbb{1}(\\mathrm{Post}\\mathrm{Deal}_{j,q})\\times X_{c}+\\beta\\mathbb{1}(\\mathrm{Post}\\mathrm{Deal}_{j,q})+\\omega X_{c}+\\alpha_{j}+\\gamma_{n,q}+\\varepsilon_{j,q,c}.\n$$  \n\nWe also use event studies to test the identifying assumption that target and control companies would continue on parallel trends in the absence of the buyout. We plot the coefficients $\\beta_{s}$ from the following equation:  \n\n$$\nY_{i}=\\sum_{s\\neq-1}\\beta_{s}\\mathbb{1}(\\mathrm{Deal~in~}q-s\\mathrm{~Quarter}_{j,q,s})+\\alpha_{j}+\\gamma_{n,q}+\\varepsilon_{i}.\n$$  \n\nHere, $\\mathbb{1}(\\mathrm{Deal~in}q-s\\mathrm{~Quarter}_{j,q,s})$ is an indicator variable equal to one if an LBO of company $j$ occurred $s$ quarters prior to quarter $q$ and zero otherwise. The quarter before the deal is omitted.16 In supplementary tests, we conduct the main analysis at the review level, which weights larger firms more heavily (note the main model weights all company-quarters equally).  \n\n## 3 Effect of LBOs on Job Quality  \n\nOne of our main contributions is to test the effect of LBOs on the job quality of current employees. In Table 2, we show that LBOs have strong negative effects on all four satisfaction dimensions. Employees satisfaction with compensation declines by 0.083 rating points after a buyout (column (1). This is economically significant; for example, it is $57\\%$ larger than the 0.053 gap we see between jobs that typically require a college degree and jobs that require only high school (Section 5). As a second benchmark, the effect is equivalent to the satisfaction decrease associated with $33\\%$ lower IRR (Section 4). LBOs have a similar negative effect on employee perceptions of the firm's culture (column (3)); to our knowledge, this offers the first evidence of how PE affects corporate culture. The negative effects on work-life balance and senior management are slightly smaller (columns (2) and (4)). Surprisingly, we find no effects on pay (columns (5)-(7), and the discrepancy does not reflect a cut to benefits.17 In Section 5, we propose a mechanism to explain why, if LBO investors do not reduce pay, we would see a decline in satisfaction with compensation.  \n\nWe use Equation (3) to test the identification assumption that LBO targets were not already on track to experience declines in employee satisfaction, in which case the declines should start before the LBO. The results, in Figure 3, contain no pre-trends for any of the four measures both for the overall sample (left) and the high leverage sample (right). There are clear, persistent decreases in satisfaction in the quarters immediately after the buyout quarter. Consistent with the regressions, the most marked changes are for compensation and culture. Event studies for reported pay also show no pre-trends (Appendix Figure A.3).  \n\nLayoffs.  An immediate question is whether the results reflect layoffs. Although it is commonly asserted that LBOs are associated with layoffs, the academic evidence is conficted.18 We use a novel LinkedIn panel (see Section 1) to understand whether layoffs occur in our setting and the extent layoffs drive our results. Appendix Figure A.4 Panel A shows that the departure rate increases in the first year after the buyout and returns to baseline during the second year. There is no increase in the hiring rate (Panel B), and therefore the overall employment growth rate declines (Panel C). These patterns also appear in the number of reviews, where there is some evidence of a short-term decline in the number of reviews by current employees (Appendix Figure A.5 Panel A) and increases in the number of reviews by former employees (Panel B). After the first two quarters, however, the number of reviews reverts to the previous level. Therefore, LBOs do not affect the aggregate number of current employee reviews (Appendix Table A.5 column (6).  \n\nWe take several steps to prevent layof-induced composition changes from biasing our results.  \n\nFirst, we drop former employees from our main analysis to prevent an increase in unhappy recently-laid-off employees driving our results. Second, in Appendix Table A.6 we show that \"high-layoff’ deals, with above-median changes in the LinkedIn departure rates between the four years prior to and after the deal, do not lead to satisfaction changes that are statistically different from low-layoff deals. We do the same for our key heterogeneity tests by adding a layoff interaction. Third, we show that long-term changes drive our key results. Fourth, in Panel A of Table 3, we consider data on former employees separately and show they have a similar-sized negativeeffect.19 Finally, in Section 6.2 we explicitly test for changes in observable characteristics.  \n\nIn sum, while one-time layoffs occur and may drive some of the negative effects on average satisfaction, they perhaps surprisingly do not appear to have first-order effects on the remaining employees. Our results appear for LBO targets that are not subject to layoffs, our measured satisfaction decreases persist long after the immediate layoffs (comparing Figure 3 and Appendix Figure A.4), and the LBO-associated layoffs themselves do not dramatically increase current employees’ propensity to review.  It remains possible that lower satisfaction stems from a permanent decrease in job security, which would represent a genuine decrease in job quality.  \n\n## 4 Risk Sharing  \n\nIncentive alignment is one of the key ways PE managers claim to add value. We examine three ways in which private-equity transactions can impact owner-employee risk sharing. First, we show that LBOs increase the sensitivity of employee compensation satisfaction to LBO investor returns. Second, we show that our LBO effects are driven by high leverage deals. Third, we show direct evidence of an increase in managerial incentive pay and an offsetting decline in reported work-life  \n\n### 4.1  Investor Returns  \n\nDo employees win when LBO investors win? Edmans (2011) and others have shown that higher returns coincide with more satisfied employees for public firms, but PE could have different effects for several reasons. If investor returns in PE come largely from extracting employee surplus, we might see a negative relationship between returns and job quality changes - the more effective PE is at extracting surplus, the worse workers do. Alternatively, there might be no correlation if PE firms always extract employee surplus in the same way regardless of the deal success. Finally, we might see a positive relationship if there is a risk-sharing mechanism in which investor successes and failures are passed through to employees, similar to the way that currency exchange rate variation passes through to wages and prices (Gopinath, Itskhoki, and Rigobon, 2010; Bussiere, 2013). Since deal performance is determined well after the deal date and occurs simultaneously with satisfaction changes, we do not seek to establish causality here.20  \n\nSatisfaction and Deal Returns. We first show the raw relationship between returns and job quality changes for the return-matched deals. Figure 4 uses bin-scatters to show there is a positive association between investor returns and changes in employee satisfaction, particularly for changes in compensation and for IRR. Figure 5 shows that while there is no relationship for base pay, there is a markedly positive slope for variable earnings across all three return measures.  \n\nNext, we examine this association after removing company- and time-specific confounders using the following linear regression model:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\bar{Y}_{j}=\\beta\\mathrm{Return}_{j}+\\omega\\mathrm{X}_{j}+\\eta_{t}+\\varepsilon_{j}.\n$$  \n\nHere, there is no causal interpretation and we attempt to identify only the residual correlation between investor outcomes and the changes in job quality at the target firm. The dependant variable $\\Delta\\bar{Y}_{j}$ is the change in average ratings from before to afer the LBO, with both ratings adjusted for industry-quarter fixed effects. The vector $\\mathrm{X}_{j}$ controls for the pre-deal average rating (to demean each firm's outcome) and the investment amount. Finally, we include deal year fixed effects, $\\eta_{t}$  \n\nThe estimates are presented in Table 4 Panel A. We use IRR, which is most closely tied to a buyout fund GPs’ carry (Robinson and Sensoy, 2013; Gredil, 2021) and is traditionally the central evaluation metric for both deals and GPs (Gompers, Kaplan, and Mukharlyamov, 2016; Da Rin and Phalippou, 2017).2 Panel A shows a large and robust positive relationship for all satisfaction measures and for incentive pay measures. For example, a $10\\%$ increase in the annualized return is associated with a $7\\%$ increase in employee variable pay (column (6)). The exception is base earnings (column (5)), where we see no effect. Appendix Table A.7 shows the same pattern for the other two return measures: TVM, which captures the total return to investors without any time or risk adjustment (Panel A), and PME, which captures idiosyncratic returns after accounting for what the comparable public market investments would deliver (Panel B). Appendix Table A.8 shows that the relationship is stronger in fully resolved deals but is similar for deals that were not yet fully resolved at the end of our sample. Furthermore, we find no relationship between the average pre-deal ratings and the deal returns, both raw and as a percentile rank within the fund (Appendix Table A.9).  \n\nOverall, it is clear that higher investor returns in LBOs are not associated with larger deteriorations in employee ratings. Instead of a zero-sum reallocation of employee surplus to investors, there instead appears to be a positive relationship, and the deals that are worst for job quality are also worst for investors.  \n\nRelative to Matched Public Firm Investments.  An association between LBO deal returns and employee satisfaction is perhaps not surprising, as public firms show a similar relationship (Edmans, 2011). This leads us to ask whether the relationship between financial performance and job quality for PE-backed firms is different from that in public firms. The positive association between returns and job quality could be weaker for PE-backed firms if PE investors are less capital constrained on the downside and more effective at keeping rents to themselves in the upside. It could be stronger if PE firms give more performance pay on the upside and pass more downside to employees through leverage, a greater willingness to fire, or costly default.  \n\nWe compare the sensitivity of public and private firms by creating a set of “mimicking” public trades for each PE deal. Our approach has two steps. First, we match each LBO target to at most the five closest publicly traded peers at the time of the deal.22 Second, for each public company we construct a hypothetical trade that mimics the cash flow pattern of the respective LBO. We follow Korteweg and Nagel (2016) and assume that investment amounts in the mimicking deals exactly match those of the actual deals, the interim distributions are a function of the time since the deal or previous distribution, and the residual value is paid off at the terminal distribution of the actual deal. Deviating from Korteweg and Nagel (2016), we use an individual stock's return rather than market-wide returns, so our mimicking trades capture both idiosyncratic and systematic risk, just as the comparable LBO's returns.  \n\nThese mimicking trades “package”’ public stock returns in PE-like cash flows. We can use them to calculate comparable IRRs, TVMs, and PMEs against style and industry sectors, just as we do for the actual LBO sponsor fund cash flows. We can then estimate the sensitivity of satisfaction to returns for LBO targets relative to public companies:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta\\bar{Y}_{j}=\\beta\\mathrm{Return}_{j}+\\delta\\mathbb{1}(\\mathrm{LBO}_{j})\\times\\mathrm{Return}_{j}+\\gamma\\mathbb{1}(\\mathrm{LBO}_{j})+\\omega\\mathrm{X}_{j}+\\alpha_{d}+\\varepsilon_{j}.\n$$  \n\nThe coefficient of interest $\\delta$ is on the interaction between the return measure and being an LBO rather than a mimicking trade. Each LBO and mimicking trade is a separate observation in the regression, with fixed effects $(\\alpha_{d})$ entering for each group of an LBO target and associated mimicking trades and other variables being as described above.  \n\nWe present the results in Table 4 Panel B.23 Better performance is associated with more satisfied employees across measures and for both public and private companies. Looking first at raw performance in the odd columns, the compensation satisfaction of employees at LBO targets is more related to investor returns than for public companies. Specifically, a 0.25 increase in log  \n\nIRR is associated with a 0.095 point increase in employee ratings of compensation, about three times as large as the 0.033 increase for the mimicking public investments. Decreases in satisfaction are correspondingly more severe. Even columns show the same results for IRR percentile rank, which adjust for the higher mean and volatility of LBO returns (Appendix Table 1 Panel D).  \n\nNote that the higher pass-through to compensation relative to public companies co-exists with lower satisfaction on average after LBOs; the coefcient on LBO independently of -0.22 implies that the LBO investor returns would need to be at least 1.1 standard deviations above the sample mean for the target's employees to experience a larger increase in satisfaction than if they were working for a comparable public company with the same stock return. Whereas the estimates in column (2) imply that the expected increase in LBO employee satisfaction is lower than that of a median public firm benchmark for deals returning below the 74th percentile investors. Importantly, the results in Table 4 are not plausibly driven by pre-deal employee satisfaction ratings, as shown in Appendix Table A.9. Finally, we show that for all models in Panel B, there is significant, positive LBO pass-through as in Panel A even though they are not significantly different from the public companies (p-values for the F-test on the sum of Return and LBO $\\times$ Return).  \n\nIn sum, the negative changes in employee satisfaction after buyouts are endemic (but not limited) to low-performing deals for investors.24 LBOs exhibit more pass-through of returns to employee satisfaction with compensation than publicly traded firms (though they have a lower average), consistent with surplus-sharing theories. This could arise from more use of explicit performance-based employment contracts or could reflect another mechanism. However, we find no evidence that pre-deal employee satisfaction ratings explain the variation in returns to LBO investors. While these correlations shed light on how PE creates value, we reiterate that there is no sense of causal determination.  \n\n### 4.2  Deal Leverage  \n\nHigh leverage is a key point of differentiation for LBOs relative to other transaction types such as M&A and growth equity. It magnifies both returns and the risk of financial distress and is seen as central to value creation in PE (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2009; Guo, Hotchkiss, and Song, 2011). We measure leverage as the value of new debt taken on in the deal relative to the deal size, enabling us to assess the change in job quality (left-hand side of the equation) as a function of the change in debt relative to firm value (right-hand side of the equation). We do not observe total debt, but this is less interesting because it does not get at the change associated with the buyout.  \n\nWe study whether leverage is related to a deal's effect on employees by separating the independent variable $\\mathbb{1}(\\mathrm{Post}\\mathrm{LBO}_{j,q})$ in  Equation(1) into  multiple  variables representing different levels of a deal characteristic. This allows us to interpret the coefficients relative to the base group of non-target control firms (in supplementary tests, we assess whether coefcients are statistically different from one another). We first divide the sample of LBOs around median leverage in Table 5 Panel A. High-leverage deals drive the negative effects on job satisfaction. This is most extreme for culture, where we see that the effect is zero for below-median leverage deals and -0.14 for above-median leverage deals, and for compensation, where the effect of above-median leverage deals is about twice as large. The differential leverage effect is always economically significant and is statistically significant for compensation and work-life balance (Appendix Table A.11). The effects increase roughly monotonically in leverage. In Panel B of Table 5, we divide the sample into quartiles. The magnitude is consistently lowest for the first quartile, and generally increases, with the negative results driven by the third and fourth quartiles. In Panel C, we show strong negative effects of an interaction with continuous leverage. (In unreported results, we find no effect of a quadratic term.) The last three columns of the table suggest weak evidence of pay increases in low-leverage deals.  \n\nWe repeat our main event study analysis for the LBO sample for deals with above-median leverage and present the results on the right side of Figure 3. Despite the smaller sample size, we clearly see that the discontinuous declines after the deal are much stronger for the high leverage deals in the right-hand graphs than for the overall sample in the left-hand graphs. Although leverage is endogenous and associated with other factors, the event studies suggest high leverage deals have a causal effect, and show that high-leverage deals do not target firms with pre-trends.  \n\nWe also rule out several alternative explanations that might plausibly be correlated with leverage. First, an association with layoffs does not seem to drive the leverage effect and, in fact, controlling for layoffs seems to strengthen the leverage results (Appendix Table A.12). Second, in Appendix B we show other deal-level variables are only weakly predictive and thus cannot explain our leverage results.  These analyses include dividing the LBO sample into three transaction types: public-to-private deals, corporate divestitures, and vanilla LBOs. The negative effects are of roughly similar magnitude across the three deal types and are not significantly different from one another. The exception is that corporate divestitures are associated with larger work-life balance declines - where employees at the targeted subsidiary may have previously benefited from managers who enjoyed the “quiet life” and suffered from the agency issues inherent in multiunit corporations (Scharfstein and Stein, 2000; Schoar, 2002; Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003) - but the results are weak relative to the leverage channel. Deal size has no strong effect, alleviating concerns about size leading to biases in debt availability. Finally, fund ESG status does not make a major difference and LBOs led by ESG funds are associated with the same negative effect on employees as other deals. In sum, although we cannot rule out the possibility that an omitted variable drives the leverage relationship, we show that common deal-level characteristics do not drive it.  \n\n### 4.3  Managerial Compensation  \n\nPE sponsors often claim that they create value through stronger incentives. Our data allow us to directly measure incentive pay, for both frontline workers and managers. The managers in these review data are generally lower- and mid-level, rather than C-suite executives. In Table 6 we show that managers enjoy a dramatic increase in performance pay after an LBO, on both the intensive margin where they receive $43\\%$ higher performance pay (column (6)) and the extensive margin (column (7)) where they are about five percentage points ( $18\\%$ of the mean) more likely to get any performance pay. This pay increase is isolated to incentive pay, with base pay going up only slightly (column (5)). In Appendix Table A.13, we break down performance pay into its four component categories and show this effect is driven by cash bonuses rather than stock or profit sharing.  \n\nPerhaps because of these stronger incentives, managers report larger declines in work-life balance (column (2)) and, in fact, drive the entire negative effect of LBOs on work-life balance. For the other satisfaction dimensions, managers are not differentially affected relative to frontline workers. Therefore, after LBOs, managers are pushed to work harder but are compensated more generously, particularly via incentive pay. This is consistent with findings by Gompers, Kaplan, and Mukharlyamov (2016) about the importance of incentives in PE deals. More generally, higher incentive compensation for managers in particular is related to the increase in overall within-firm pay inequality (Piketty, 2013) and also a greater connection between higher and more volatile pay for managers and higher firm productivity (Bloom et al., 2021). Our results suggest that the dramatically increasing footprint of the LBO business model may in part be responsible for these trends.  \n\nThe rise in manager incentive pay raises the possibility that LBOs reduce satisfaction with compensation by increasing within-firm pay inequality (Bandiera, Barankay, and Rasul, 2007; Breza, Kaur, and Shamdasani, 2017). To assess whether this may be the case, we construct three standard measures of within-firm pay inequality: the standard deviation, 90-10 ratio, and 90-50 ratio, all at the company-quarter level. We first examine whether LBOs increase inequality in either base pay or total pay. Appendix Table A.14 Panel A shows that there is no statistically significant effect within our data, though the coefficients are positive and larger when we include incentive pay. Next, we create an indicator for LBOs that have above-median changes in inequality. Panel B shows these deals do not have different effects from deals with below-median inequality changes (the interaction coefficients are near-zero and insignificant). Therefore, higher within-firm inequality does not appear to explain the overall decline in satisfaction.  \n\n## 5 Models of Risk Sharing  \n\nSince the rise of agency theory, the degree to which employees and employers share risk has been a topic of great interest (Ross, 1973; Holmstrom, 1979). Intuitively, exposing employees to greater risk, whether through incentive pay, firm leverage, or profit sharing, can strengthen incentives and increase productivity (Lazear, 2000). At the same time, employees are generally more risk averse than the firm, and incentive pay increases the risks that employees bear. Higher leverage increases the chances of firm distress, which leads to layoffs, which in turn imposes large costs on workers who are not fully insured and face large switching costs to find an equivalent job (Cantor et al., 1990; Asquith, Gertner, and Scharfstein, 1994; Sharpe, 1994). Under risk bearing models, workers demand compensating wage differentials to offset that risk (Abowd and Ashenfelter, 1981; Hamermesh and Wolfe, 1990).  \n\nThis logic can help explain capital structure. Theoretically, Titman (1984), Chang (1992), and Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010) show that since financial distress - in particular firm liquidation - is costly to workers, firms should choose a debt level below that which maximizes the firm's financial value. Empirical work in support of this view includes Chemmanur, Cheng, and Zhang (2013), Agrawal and Matsa (2013), and Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin (2015).  \n\nEx-ante, a firm may wish to commit to low leverage and stable pay to attract workers. In the Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010) model, the firm pays a risk-averse worker a wage that never falls unless the firm is in distress, but rises with good news about worker productivity (following Harris and Holmstrom (1982). This leads to entrenchment where workers are on average paid above the competitive market wage. Importantly, the employee's surplus is positively related to her tenure. If the firm is liquidated, the worker must take a large pay cut in her new job. When the firm takes on more debt and thereby increases the chance of liquidation, the firm compensates workers for risk by raising pay. In turn, higher labor costs lead the firm to have below-optimal debt, which leads to a persistent clientele effect where some firms have sub-optimally low leverage and attract particularly risk-averse employees.  \n\nBerk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010) and related models rely on firms upholding an implicit contract between shareholders and workers. LBO investors may exploit an arbitrage opportunity: With the decline in unions and labor power generally, modern labor markets may not require firms to abide by the implicit contract. Previously, the firm may have done so because incumbent managers and shareholders faced some inertia or enjoyed private benefits from employee welfare. LBO investors may target firms that are under-levered from the perspective of incentives or the tax benefits of debt. They increase leverage dramatically, but do not increase pay as the implicit contract would require, a breach of implicit contracts along the lines of Shleifer and Summers (1988).  \n\nThis mechanism has three key implications, which we test in turn. First, higher leverage requires a compensating differential, which leads workers to feel underpaid when leverage increases in an LBO without a corresponding pay increase. Second, post-LBO hires are not impacted by these changes because they did not suffer a contract breach - they are fairly paid given the risk they take on. Third, the model predicts larger effects for workers with longer tenure and generally more “slack,” in the sense that their current job is preferred to their outside options.  \n\nReduced Compensation Satisfaction without Reduced Compensation. We showed a decline in compensation satisfaction despite no measurable change in base pay. Although perhaps initially puzzling, these results are entirely consistent with theories of costly employee risk-bearing. If workers are risk-averse, they demand higher wages from firms that are more likely to fall into financial distress. Post buyout, non-managers earn the same pay at a riskier firm, so they perceive themselves to be underpaid relative to their new job and new risk.  \n\nThese compensation results are harder to square with other models of leverage impacting employees. For example, in some contexts firms strategically increase leverage to extract wage concessions from labor (Perotti and Spier, 1993; Matsa, 2010).25 These models generally predict lower wages overall but do not provide clear predictions on passthrough, while we find no average wage change but large increases in passthrough, including much higher incentive pay for managers. Therefore, in the LBO case it does not seem that new owners are using leverage as a  \n\nstrategic bargaining tool.  \n\nNew Hires.  Comparing how LBOs impact new hires versus existing employees offers a further test. Under a Shleifer and Summers (1988)-style breach of implicit contracts, existing employees will be hurt but new hires ought to be unaffected. On the other hand, generally employee-unfriendly operational changes would impact both pre-existing employees and new hires, relative to both groups at control firms.  \n\nWe attempt to differentiate between these in Panel B of Table 3 by comparing the effect of an LBO on current employees who started after the PE deal (new hires) with current employees who started before the deal (pre-deal employees), using review-level data.26 The first row of coefcients documents large negative effects among current employees who were hired before the deal. Adding these to the significant, positive coefficients for new hires in the second row indicates that new hires are unaffected. This points away from employee-unfriendly operational changes as a mechanism because these should affect new hires as well.  \n\nEmployee Slack.  An increase in risk sharing would have the largest effect on employees with the most to lose, either because they have worse outside options or because they are entrenched and have captured more surplus.  We consider different measures of this slack, looking at characteristics that would predict outside options and entrenchment. Perhaps the most natural measure of outside options is labor market conditions. If unemployment is relatively high, workers face higher costs to job loss and thus higher costs of firm risk. We assess whether the effects are stronger when the industry has a higher unemployment rate in Table 7. Indeed, we see that the effects on compensation (column(1) and culture (column (3)) are twice as large in industry-years with above-median unemployment, consistent with risk being more costly when workers have worse outside options.27  \n\nNext, we consider job tenure, which is related both to switching costs and entrenchment. We divide the current employees into those with less than three years and those with more than three years of tenure at the firm. In Table 8, we show that the results for all four satisfaction dimensions are driven by workers with longer tenure. The coefficients are near zero for short-tenure workers, while long-tenured workers experience large negative effects. For example, the negative effect on compensation is over $10\\%$ of a standard deviation for long-tenured workers (column (1). This result is robust to using review-level data and to controlling for skill. In Appendix Table A.15 Panel A, we report the results at the review level, now exploiting the higher power to consider four tenure categories. We find that in general, the most negative effects are among workers with at least four years of tenure, though there are also significant negative effects among workers with 2- 3 years of tenure. In Panel B, we find that these results are essentially unaffected when we include controls for worker education, experience, and manager fixed effects.  \n\nOur final employee characteristics are proxies for skill. Unskilled workers are arguably the losers in the current changing economy, facing pressure from automation and the rise of gig labor. For example, Araujo et al. (2021) show they face the largest costs from employer bankruptcies. To test whether these workers are more negatively impacted, in Table 9 Panel A we compare effects across jobs that typically require less and more than three years of experience and in Panel B we compare the effects across jobs based on the education level typically required. The negative effects on compensation, culture, and senior management are generally driven by lower-skill workers (columns (1), (3), and (4)), while the negative effect on work-life balance is driven by higher-skill workers (column (2)), consistent with the relationship for managers. We also see an increase in base pay, of about $3\\%$ , for higher-skill workers (column (5)), and a positive albeit insignificant coefficient on variable pay.  \n\nIn these tables, the independent average effects of the characteristics offer benchmarks for assessing the magnitude of the negative effect of LBOs. For example, people in jobs that require a college degree are about 0.10 rating points more satisfied with their firm's culture (Table 9 Panel B column (3). Therefore, the average negative effect of LBOs on satisfaction with culture, at -0.09 rating points, represents nearly the average difference in satisfaction with culture associated with a college degree. To provide a second benchmark, this negative effect is about half the average extra satisfaction that managers have with firm culture relative to non-managers (which is 0.2 rating points, from Table 6 column (3)).  \n\nIn sum, the decline in satisfaction with pay is concentrated among less-skilled, entry-level workers and those who have been at the firm for a longer period. To the extent these workers would be hurt more by risk, this supports our risk based explanation.  \n\n## 6 Validation and Robustness Tests  \n\nIn this section, we conduct an array of tests that validate and confirm our main results. First, we show LBOs are distinct from other types of deals. Second, we show our results are robust to employee composition changes.  Finally, we show our results are robust to a variety of specifications.  \n\n### 6.1 Other Deal Types  \n\nRecapitalizations. Since leverage is endogenous, our leverage results could reflect something about high-leverage LBOs that is not related to new debt.28 To further test the importance of leverage for job quality, we consider situations outside of PE where firms quickly take on large amounts of new debt. We focus on recapitalizations, which occur when a public firm increases its leverage by issuing debt while simultaneously buying back shares or issuing large dividends (Kovenock and Phillips, 1997). There are several reasons for these transactions, including fending off a hostile takeover and facilitating the exit of a large shareholder. Using Compustat data, we define recapitalizations as occurring when a firm increases debt by at least $5\\%$ of assets while at the same time buying back shares and paying out cash worth a combined total of more than $5\\%$ assets.29 This fiter captures large capital structure changes, with the average transaction leading to a $37\\%$ increase in book leverage from a $22\\%$ debt issue, an $8\\%$ share buyback, and an $8\\%$ dividend, all expressed as percentages of firm assets. We match these firms to our Glassdoor data, yielding 258 leveraged recapitalizations during 2010-2016. Although these firms are undergoing large capital structure changes, assets increase just $4\\%$ , suggesting much of the change is financial reorganization rather than expansion. We follow the capital structure literature (e.g., Korteweg, Schwert, and Strebulaev (2019) by considering firms whose assets always exceed $\\$10$ million.  \n\nTable 10 reports the association between public recapitalizations and changes in our seven job qualitymeasures. Higher-debt  recapitalizations  are  associated  with  larger  decreases  in compensation satisfaction, consistent with our results from LBOs. The coefficient is large and of strikingly similar size to the leverage coefficient on PE deals (Table 5 Panel C). While the effect of leverage may be similar, the overall change is not: buyouts with relatively low levels of debt are associated with no change in compensation satisfaction, while recapitalizations with relatively low levels of debt are associated with an increase. In addition to providing support for a relationship between leverage and compensation satisfaction, this table helps to confirm that there is something particular about LBOs that leads to our suite of effects (further evidence is in our analysis of other deal types below).  \n\nCanceled Deals. A central concern with our main analytical approach is that because PE firms do not target companies at random, there may be unobservables at the targeted firms that would lead them to have the effects we see in the absence of the buyout. This raises the question of what the counterfactual would be in the absence of the deal. Above, we addressed this concern with event studies, which establish that targets were not on track towards the negative effects before the deal. We push our identification further by studying canceled deals. We obtain 110 canceled LBOs from PitchBook and Capital IQ. Appendix Table A.16 Panel A presents summary statistics on reviews for these firms, in the same manner as Table 1 Panel A. Panel B reports the differencesin-differences effect of canceled LBOs on employee satisfaction measures, relative to the same set of control firms as in the main analysis (target firms of LBOs are omitted from the sample). There are no negative effects of canceled LBOs. The coefficients are generally small and insignificant, except for a positive effect at the $10\\%$ significance level on Work-Life Balance. This provides  \n\nstrong support for our identification assumption.  \n\nGeneric Acquisition Restructuring.  The effects of LBOs might be common to acquisitions more generally. To address this, we gather data on conventional acquisitions from Capital IQ to compare their effects to those of PE acquisitions. We require M&A transactions to have a public or private corporate buyer and to occur between 2010 and 2016, have a U.S. target, have a value of $\\$100$ million or above, and not be LBO, MBO, or bankruptcy transactions.30 Out of a total of 5,672 deals meeting these requirements, we match 2,040 to Glassdoor.31 Among these, we eliminate deals in which the acquirer did not take a majority stake or where we do not observe reviews by current employees both before and after the deal. This requires acquired companies to become subsidiaries rather than be subsumed into the acquirer and disappear. As a result, the matched deals tend to be large relative to the average acquisition, which is helpful because it makes them more comparable to the LBO targets. This leads to 1,010 M&A deals in the final analysis sample. Summary statistics on these deals are in Appendix Table A.17.  \n\nWe present results in Table 11. These models use Equation 1, except the independent variables of interest are post-deal indicators, and should be interpreted relative to control firms that are never acquired, not relative to one another. The first row in Table 11 indicates that LBOs negatively affect all four satisfaction dimensions. In contrast, traditional corporate acquisitions have weaker and mixed effects. Specifically, M&A negatively affects compensation, but with a less precise and smaller magnitude than LBOs. There is a strong negative effect of M&A on senior management ratings, but no effect on work-life balance or culture. The comparison to M&A allows us to conclude that while LBO effects may partially refect generic restructuring after an acquisition, a portion of the negative effect on compensation as well as the effects on the non-pecuniary amenities of work-life balance and culture appear specific to LBOs.  \n\nOther PE Deal Types.  We are interested in whether our main effects reflect simply the event of any PE transaction, or are particular to the mixture of changes - notably a change in control and high leverage - that occur following LBOs. The subsequent rows of Table 11 consider two other deal types. First, MBOs have negative effects on compensation, but no effects on the other three dimensions. Recall that in an MBO, the existing managers of a company purchase a controlling interest in a company with the help of a PE firm. While leverage increases, management is generally constant, helping to explain the zero effect on senior management.  \n\nIn a growth equity deal, the PE firm takes a non-majority stake in a company to fund new investment. If the LBO effects are common to any new investment, we expect to see similar results for growth equity, but the bottom row of the table shows that these deals have no effects. Overall, deals characterized by increases in leverage (LBO and MBO) experience the largest declines in satisfaction with compensation.  \n\n### 6.2  Employee Composition and Distribution Effects  \n\nOur results could potentially be driven by changes to employee composition around LBOs. We examine whether this is the case in Appendix Figure A.6, where we plot changes in our employee characteristics around the time of the deal. These charts show no obvious deal effects, something we confirm in Appendix Table A.5. In unreported tests, we control for five aspects of employee composition in our deal- and company-level analysis and find that while the sample size is reduced, the results are robust to including all of the measures or any subset.32  \n\nThe company-quarter level analysis further obviates concerns about composition changes along the dimensions we study; for example that fewer managers submit reviews after the buyout and managers are in general correlated with higher ratings. This is because the data are constructed as the average review for each cohort (e.g. managers vs. non-managers) after vs. before the buyout and relative to the difference across cohorts at control firms. Therefore, it does not seem that the employee heterogeneity factors explain the results.  \n\nA related concern is that the results could refect a shift in the tail of the satisfaction distribution at LBO targets, with no effect in the middle of the distribution. Appendix Figure A.7 presents quantile regression estimates of the effect of LBOs on four dimensions of employee satisfaction at 5 different quantiles (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th). The coefficients of $\\mathbb{1}(\\mathrm{Post}\\mathrm{LBO})$ are all negative at different points of the satisfaction distribution, though we see different magnitudes of the effect. The results are not driven by a change to the tail of the distribution but rather to declines across all percentiles, but especially the middle and upper-middle.  \n\n### 6.3 Robustness Checks  \n\nOur results are robust to several alternative specifications. In the interests of space, we discuss these in Online Appendix C. Specifically, we show our results are robust to a matching estimator, do not appear to be driven by endogenous target selection, and hold for different aggregation methods, different cuts of the sample, and additional rating measures.  \n\n## 7 Conclusion  \n\nThis paper offers the first analysis, to our knowledge, of the effect of PE buyouts on job quality as perceived by employees. We show that LBOs are associated with significant perceived declines in job quality and increases in managerial incentive pay. In contrast to a narrative of broad-based cost-cutting, we find no effects on average pay. Instead, risk transfer appears to play a central role, with LBOs leading to more return passthrough to employees than at comparable public firms. Relatedly, relatively high leverage LBOs appear to have much stronger negative effects.  \n\nOur results are consistent with risk-averse employees reporting job quality declines due to a perceived loss of promised job security. As further tests of this, we show that predictors of worker entrenchment and unemployment cost, such as industry unemployment rates, long job tenure, and low skill, are associated with larger negative job quality effects. Although immediate post-deal layoffs doubtless contribute to feelings of insecurity, they do not drive our effects.  \n\nOverall, this paper sheds new light on how PE affects the nature of the firm, pushing beyond the existing literature on employment, separations, and wages. LBOs appear to reallocate surplus away from more replaceable and entrenched employees and achieve better matches with new hires. Our results point to a need for further research on how ownership type affects employees, potentially using alternative measures of culture and comprehensive measures of compensation. Another important venue for future research is disentangling the role of ex-ante commitment by PE sponsors to sharing gains with the LBO target employees from the ex-post incentive pay (and perk) hikes if the deal turned very successful.  \n\n# References  \n\nAbadie, Alberto and Guido W Imbens. 2006. “Large Sample Properties of Matching Estimators for Average Treatment Effects.

Panel A presents statistics on each Glassdoor rating dimension, reported pay, and the number of reviews at company-quarter and review level. The Ever-LBO sample is all the companies with LBO deals in our main analysis, including vanilla LBOs, public-to-private deals, and corporate divestitures (together, these comprise 1,371 deals). The control sample is non-targeted companies. Panel B presents statistics on employee characteristics. Reported Tenure is the length of employment as reported on Glassdoor. Whether a reviewer's reported job title is managerial and the work experience and education it typically requires are calculated as discussed in Section 1. Panel C presents deal characteristics of the PitchBook-Glassdoor matched deals in our main analysis. Panel D describes the investor return data from the Stepstone SPI database that is matched to Glassdoor company and Pitchbook deal information. The last three lines describe the returns metrics for the mimicking public equity investments. We follow Korteweg and Nagel (2016) to construct cash flows out of stock returns from CRSP to mimic the patterns observed in PE. We take the closest five matches for each LBO using the distance metric from Abadie and Imbens (2006). PMEs are calculated relative to the relevant Russell 20o0 Sector Index.  \n\nTable 2: Effect of LBOs on Job Quality   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">SatisfactionData</td><td colspan=\"3\">Pay Data</td></tr><tr><td>Compensation &Benefits (1)</td><td>Work-Life Balance (2)</td><td>Culture& Values (3)</td><td>Senior Management (4)</td><td>Base Earnings (5)</td><td>Variable Earnings (6)</td><td>Any Variable Earnings (7)</td></tr><tr><td>1(Post LBO)</td><td>-0.083*** (0.018)</td><td>-0.064*** (0.019)</td><td>-0.093*** (0.025)</td><td>-0.063*** (0.022)</td><td>0.015 (0.010)</td><td>0.099 (0.086)</td><td>0.010 (0.010)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>859,501</td><td>861,251</td><td>769,555</td><td>852,586</td><td>484,579</td><td>484,579</td><td>484,579</td></tr><tr><td>Company FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry-Quarter FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.355</td><td>0.326</td><td>0.352</td><td>0.347</td><td>0.606</td><td>0.436</td><td>0.415</td></tr><tr><td>OutcomeS.D.</td><td>1.145</td><td>1.170</td><td>1.277</td><td>1.323</td><td>0.510</td><td>3.504</td><td>0.391</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: This table reports the effect of LBOs on job quality measures.

The dependent variables are the change in the residualized quarterly average ratings or reported wages (as indicated in the column of the table) from the pre-deal quarters average to the post-deal quarters average. The independent variable of interest are (i) a natural log of 1.1 plus IRR of the deal, and (i) the percentile rank of the deal's IRR. Panel A reports analysis that uses only the sample of LBOs, while in Panel B the sample is augmented with mimicking investments in public companies. LBO' is a dummy variables that takes a value of 1 for actual LBOs and O for the mimicking public investments, each entering as a separate observation. For each LBO we match with replacement up to 5 public companies based on industry, year founded, log number of reviews, share of jobs requiring only a high school diploma, and share of reviews by employees with at least three years of tenure. The IRRs of the mimicking investments in public companies are constructed from their respective stock returns and the cash flow pattern of the matching LBO (see Section 4.1 for details). The IRR percentile ranks are computed separately within the LBO sample and within the mimicking public investments sample and normalize to be between -0.5 and 0.5. In Panel A, the control variables include year of the deal, amounted invested, and the average rating or salary data before the deal that corresponds to the dependent variable. In Panel B, the control variables include the pre-deal rating averages and the deal case fixed effects that indicate each LBO with the mimicking investments that match to it. Standard errors are clustered the industry sub-sector of the LBO, as indicated in SPI. In Panel B, we double-cluster by the company identifier and the LBO industry sub-sector. \\*\\*\\* denotes p-value $<0.01$ ，\\*denotes $<0.05$ and $^*$ denotes ${<}0.1$  \n\nTable 5: Heterogeneity in

The Ever-M&A sample is all the companies with M&A deals in our main analysis (1,010 deals). The control sample is non-targeted companies.  \n\n# Appendix B: Deal Characteristic Analysis For Online Publication  \n\nDeal Type and Size  We examine two other important deal characteristics in Appendix Table B.1. First, we divide the LBO sample into three transaction types: public-to-private deals, corporate divestitures, and vanilla LBOs. The results, in Panel A, show that the negative effects are of roughly similar magnitude across the three deal types, and except for one, they are not significantly different from one another. The outlier is work-life balance, where corporate divestitures show a negative effect that is more than three times as large as vanilla LBOs. The coefficient of -0.158 represents $14\\%$ of a standard deviation (Panel A column (2)) and is significantly more negative than other LBOs (Appendix Table B.2 Panel A column (2)). Therefore, corporate divestitures are primarily responsible for a large share of the efficiencies in which employees are asked to work harder, and are also the largest source of negative effects on compensation. In these types of deals, employees at the targeted subsidiary may have previously benefited from managers who enjoyed the “\"quiet life” and suffered from the agency issues inherent in multiunit corporations (Scharfstein and Stein, 2000; Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003). For example, Schoar (2002) argues that “conglomerates dissipate rents in the form of higher wages.?\"  \n\nThe next characteristic is deal size. We define small as the bottom two terciles and large as the top tercile, though the results are similar using alternative deal size breakdowns. The results, shown in Appendix Table B.1 Panel B, indicate that the main effect is robust across both smaller and larger deals. However, there are more adverse effects on culture in smaller deals (column (3)). The effects on satisfaction with worklife balance and senior management are larger among bigger deals (columns (2) and (4)). These results combined with the corporate divestiture results from Panel A support the idea that as firms become larger and more diversified, employees are not required to work as hard, creating opportunities for an external acquirer (Seru, 2014).  \n\nESG and Impact Funds  Creating a positive social impact is an increasingly important priority for institutional investors, with the share of managed assets in the U.S. that are under ESG mandates as much as doubling since 2015 to represent $\\$17$ trillion or a third of the total.3 Labor relations are central to the \"social’ component of ESG (Henisz, Koller, and Nuttall, 2019). We examine whether deals led by funds with ESG or Impact investment mandates show different effects.  \n\nTo do so, we acquired Preqin's ESG module, which includes measures of ESG status for nearly 37,000 PE funds. We are able to match $48\\%$ of the Glassdoor-Pitchbook deals’ funds to Preqin's funds, resulting $59\\%$ of the Glassdoor-Pitchbook deals having at least one fund matched to Preqin's funds. We focus on two categories: ESG and the subset of ESG called “Impact.\" We classify deals according to the fund classification of the lead investor. The ESG category applies to any fund that reports considering environmental, social, or governance factors in its decision-making. The narrower “Impact’ category includes funds with explicit investment policies to fund frms with positive social impact.34 The Impact label has the stricter requirement that funds provide a formal impact strategy and evidence of compliance. Table 1 Panel C shows that while $13\\%$ of the deals in our data are associated with funds that describe themselves as ESG, only $3\\%$ are associated with Impact funds.  \n\nWe first consider the full set of all ESG funds. As shown in Appendix Table B.3 Panel A, deals led by ESG funds are associated with the same negative effect on employees as other deals. One explanation is that fund ESG status is self-reported and notoriously poorly measured, which can enable funds to label themselves as ESG-oriented even if they are not.35 Regardless, our results indicate that if limited partners wished to screen firms on treating employees well (as measured by the employees? own perceptions), they cannot achieve this by screening only on a broad ESG category. As labor relations become an increasing priority among limited partners, this potentially points to the need for new measures and sources of data.36  \n\nWe next focus on the Impact indicator, which represents the narrow category of investments by funds that, according to Preqin, require portfolio companies to have a positive impact. In Appendix Table B.3 Panel B, we document that our negative results are driven by non-Impact funds. There is no measurable effect of buyouts on employee satisfaction when the investment fund has an Impact orientation. Although this sample is small and our coefficients imprecise, it points to potential benefits from more stringent screens.  \n\n# Table B.1: Heterogeneity in Effect of LBOs on Job Quality by Deal Type and Size  \n\nPanel A: Deal Type   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">SatisfactionData</td><td colspan=\"3\">Pay Data</td></tr><tr><td>Compensation &Benefits (1)</td><td>Work-Life Balance (2)</td><td>Culture& Values (3)</td><td>Senior Management (4)</td><td>Base Earnings</td><td>Variable Earnings (6)</td><td>Any Variable Earnings</td></tr><tr><td>1(Post LBO)× I(Public to Private)</td><td>-0.069*</td><td>-0.067</td><td>-0.096</td><td>-0.069</td><td>(5) -0.004</td><td>-0.204</td><td>(7) -0.027</td></tr><tr><td>I(Post LBO)× I(Corp.Divestiture)</td><td>(0.040) -0.120***</td><td>(0.044) -0.158***</td><td>(0.061) -0.107*</td><td>(0.050) -0.098**</td><td>(0.020) 0.022</td><td>(0.168) 0.270</td><td>(0.019) 0.031</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">1(Post LBO) × I(Vanilla LBO)</td><td>(0.044)</td><td>(0.043)</td><td>(0.059)</td><td>(0.050)</td><td>(0.023)</td><td>(0.231)</td><td>(0.025)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.077***</td><td>-0.037</td><td>-0.090***</td><td>-0.052*</td><td>0.020</td><td>0.161</td><td>0.018</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>(0.022)</td><td>(0.023)</td><td>(0.030)</td><td>(0.027)</td><td>(0.013)</td><td>(0.107)</td><td>(0.012)</td></tr><tr><td>Company FE</td><td>859,501 Yes</td><td>861,251 Yes</td><td>769,555 Yes</td><td>852,586 Yes</td><td>484,579 Yes</td><td>484,579 Yes</td><td>484,579</td></tr><tr><td>Industry-Quarter FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.355</td><td>0.326</td><td>0.352</td><td>0.347</td><td>0.606</td><td>0.436</td><td>Yes 0.415</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>1.145</td><td></td><td>1.277</td><td>1.323</td><td>0.510</td><td>3.504</td><td>0.391</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome S.D.</td><td></td><td>1.170</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B: Deal Size   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">SatisfactionData</td><td colspan=\"3\">Pay Data</td></tr><tr><td>Compensation &Benefits (1)</td><td>Work-Life Balance (2)</td><td>Culture & Values (3)</td><td>Senior Management (4)</td><td>Base Earnings (5)</td><td>Variable Earnings (6)</td><td>AnyVariable Earnings</td></tr><tr><td>1(Post LBO)× 1(Small Deal Size)</td><td>-0.123***</td><td>-0.062*</td><td>-0.153***</td><td>-0.053</td><td>0.013</td><td>0.190</td><td>(7) 0.018</td></tr><tr><td>1(Post LBO) × 1(Large Deal Size)</td><td>(0.032) -0.095***</td><td>(0.035) -0.112***</td><td>(0.048) -0.057</td><td>(0.041) -0.115***</td><td>(0.020) -0.006</td><td>(0.171) 0.085</td><td>(0.019) 0.007</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>(0.034) 847,818</td><td>(0.036) 849,553</td><td>(0.053) 759,218</td><td>(0.041) 840,953</td><td>(0.017) 480,056</td><td>(0.156) 480,056</td><td>(0.017) 480,056</td></tr><tr><td>Company FE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industry-QuarterFE</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.355</td><td>0.326</td><td>0.353</td><td>0.348</td><td>0.607</td><td>0.437</td><td>0.416</td></tr><tr><td>OutcomeS.D.</td><td>1.145</td><td>1.170</td><td>1.277</td><td>1.323</td><td>0.510</td><td>3.504</td><td>0.391</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: This table shows whether deal type and deal size lead to different effects relative to a base of non-targeted companies, using Equation (1).

We use a matching estimator to construct an alternative control sample that is as similar as possible to the target sample. This helps to ensure that the full sample does not lead to spurious biases due to firms that are extremely different from buyout targets. We match each LBO target company to five never-PE-owned companies with at least one review in the three years prior to the deal. The matching is based on the founded year, industry, average percent of reviewers with more than three years of tenure, average percent of reviewers in jobs that do not typically require college, and log number of reviews. The last three variables are measured over the most recent three years. We use the Abadie and Imbens (2006) distance metric that weights each dimension by its standard deviation. Appendix Table C.1 shows that the matched sample is broadly similar to the LBO targets, except that the matched sample has broadly higher ex-ante satisfaction ratings. If anything, this should bias the estimation against finding a negative effect of LBOs. Matching estimator results are in Appendix Table C.2. The effects are similar to the main model.37 This further alleviates concerns about selection bias.  \n\nTargeting. Our results raise the question of whether PE investors target frms with particularly high satisfaction for LBOs. In Appendix Table C.3, we predict buyouts using an indicator for the firm being acquired in an LBO the following quarter, dropping all subsequent quarters under PE ownership. As in the other analyses, the control group is all quarters for firms that never receive PE investment. The independent variables are rolling averages of firm-quarter-level characteristics over the preceding eight quarters. Across all models, we include firm age and size, proxied by number of reviews. Both of these predict being an LBO target. In addition, we find that LBO investors tend to target firms with relatively high ratings for Work-Life balance, which could reflect targeting high-slack firms (column (1)). However, we do not find evidence of targeting on the other dimensions. We also do not find any evidence of targeting on employee characteristics (column (2)). They do seem to target firms with somewhat lower base pay (column (3)).  \n\nAggregation. In Appendix Table C.4, we present the main analysis for all the ownership types at the review level - rather than the company-quarter level - and generally find similar results. The skewed firm size distribution means this review-level model puts most of its weight on the largest firms. Here, there is no effect of M&A transactions on satisfaction with compensation. The effects of LBOs on satisfaction with work-life balance and senior management are smaller and insignificant, suggesting that these results are driven by smaller firms, perhaps where the average reviewer has more contact with top executives at the firm.  \n\nIn Appendix Table C.5 Panel A, we cluster standard errors by quarter rather than by company, which leads to more precise estimates than in our main table. In Appendix Table C.5 Panel B, the dependent variables are the median rather than average rating for each dimension. The estimates are similar to those in the main table.  \n\nSample Cuts. Another sample construction concern is that the results refect the aftermath of the financial crisis. In Appendix Table C.6, we show that the results are similar when using only deals that took place after 2013. This helps address both concerns about lower completeness for the early part of the sample and the possibility that PE deals in the wake of the financial crisis were systematically different.  \n\nWe have many more reviews for the largest LBOs, as shown in Appendix Figure C.1. Our results are robust to different mechanisms of dealing with this dispersion beyond just considering review level versus company-quarter level. In Appendix Table C.7 we show that the results are robust to requiring a company to have at least 30 reviews in total during our sample period. This ensures that the results do not refect firms with small numbers of reviews. We weight companies based on the number of reviews they have early in the sample for Appendix Table C.8 and again find the same results.  \n\nRecall that each review does not necessarily include ratings on all four dimensions. In Appendix Table C.9, we show that the results are very similar to those in our main table when we restrict the sample to reviewers who rate the company on all dimensions.  \n\nAdditional Rating Dimensions. Finally, we examine the rating dimensions that we do not use in our main analysis, because they are either sparsely populated or highly correlated with our main variables. These are Career Opportunities, Recommend this Company, Business Outlook, and Approves of CEO. The second and fourth are binary measures (the reviewer answers Yes or No). The third has answers including negative, neutral, and positive, which we convert into -1, O, and 1, respectively. We also exclude Overall Rating because it is not a specific dimension of job quality and it correlates closely with the sum of the four dimensions we study. Panel A of Appendix Table C.10 contains summary statistics on these additional dimensions. Panel B shows the effect of PE buyouts on employee satisfaction on these additional rating dimensions. We find robust negative effects on all outcomes except for benefits, which was discussed above.  \n\n![](images/03660c0583bb9bed0233f8884123aaf078058762b0504baab8d80039e0087caa.jpg)  \nFigure C.1: Number of Reviews Per LBO Target  \n\nNote: This figure presents a histogram of the number of Glassdoor reviews for the LBO targets in our analysis sample.  \n\nTable C.1: Comparison of LBO Targets and Matched Non-target Peers   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>LBO targets Mean</td><td>Non-target Peers Mean</td><td>Difference T-test</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Firm Characteristics at Deal Date</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firm Age</td><td>28.247</td><td>28.528</td><td>-0.281</td></tr><tr><td>NumberofReviews</td><td>15.449</td><td>16.563</td><td>-1.114</td></tr><tr><td>% Long Tenure</td><td>0.443</td><td>0.443</td><td>0.000</td></tr><tr><td>% High School</td><td>0.193</td><td>0.186</td><td>0.007</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-deal Average Ratings</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Compensation&Benefits</td><td>3.198</td><td>3.288</td><td>-0.090***</td></tr><tr><td>Work-Life Balance</td><td>3.523</td><td>3.525</td><td>-0.002</td></tr><tr><td>Culture &Values</td><td>3.451</td><td>3.511</td><td>-0.060</td></tr><tr><td>Senior Management</td><td>3.099</td><td>3.184</td><td>-0.085***</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: This table shows pre-deal frm characteristics for the LBO targets and the matched control sample of Glassdoor non-targets.

    "reference_markdown": "# PRODUCTIVITY DISPERSION, BETWEEN-FIRM COMPETITION, AND THE LABORSHARE  \n\nEMILIEN GOUIN-BONENFANT Department of Economics, Columbia University  \n\nI study the effect of labor market imperfections on the labor share in a tractable model that emphasizes the interaction between productivity dispersion and firm competition for workers. I calibrate the model using administrative data covering the universe of firms in Canada from 2000 to 2015. As in the data, most firms have a high labor share, yet the aggregate labor share is low due to the disproportionate effect of a small fraction of large, highly productive firms. I find that a rise in the dispersion of firm productivity causes the aggregate labor share to decline in favor of firm profits. The mechanism is that productivity dispersion effectively shields high-productivity firms from wage competition. Regression evidence from cross-country and cross-industry data supports both the model prediction and mechanism.  \n\nKEYwORDs: Productivity dispersion, firm dynamics, search frictions, labor share.  \n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION  \n\nFOR MOST OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, worker compensation in the U.S. grew one-forone with labor productivity. This observation has been enshrined as one of the stylized facts of economic growth (Kaldor (1961)). However, starting around 1990, worker compensation has stagnated relative to labor productivity, leading to a decline of the labor share (Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013); Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014)). Over that same period, there has been a sustained rise in the dispersion of firm productivity, where the labor productivity gap between the best firms and the rest has widened (Kehrig (2015); Barth, Bryson, Davis, and Freeman (2016)).  \n\nIn this paper, I study the effect of labor market imperfections on the labor share in a model that emphasizes the interaction between productivity dispersion and firm competition for workers. First, I build a tractable model of firm dynamics with search frictions and wage posting in the labor market. I use the model to generate theoretical predictions regarding the link between the distribution of firm productivity and the aggregate labor share. Second, I calibrate and validate the model using administrative data covering the universe of firms in Canada over the 2000-2015 period. Third, I use the model to simulate the effect of a rise in productivity dispersion and contrast its predictions with evidence from cross-industry and cross-country data.  \n\nI have two main findings. First, I find that labor market imperfections have large and heterogeneous effects on firm-level labor shares. Through the lens of the model, labor market imperfections depress the aggregate labor share by 15 percentage points (compared to a frictionless model) yet they raise the average firm-level labor share by 12 percentage points. This asymmetric effect is due to the fact that value-added is concentrated within large, highly productive firms that exert significant monopsony power (i.e., they pay wages below the marginal product of labor).  \n\nSecond, I establish theoretically that a rise in productivity dispersion causes the aggregate labor share to decline in favor of firm profits. The amount of competition that firms face in the model is effectively determined by how close they are to their competitors in terms of productivity. Rising productivity dispersion thus shields high-productivity firms from wage competition. Quantitatively, I find that a rise in productivity dispersion of the same magnitude as what the U.S. economy has experienced over the 2000-2015 period causes a 1.3 percentage point decline in the aggregate labor share. Interestingly, the effect of a rise in productivity dispersion works through a reallocation of value-added toward firms with a low (and declining) labor share, rather than a broad-based decline of firm-level labor shares.  \n\n### Overview of the Paper  \n\nIn Section 2, I present the model and derive a number of theoretical predictions. The model embeds a labor market with search frictions, wage posting, and on-the-job search (as in Burdett and Mortensen (1998)) in a continuous-time firm dynamics model where firms face productivity shocks (as in Coles and Mortensen (2016)). In the model, firms solve a dynamic problem and choose how much capital to rent, what wage to offer, and when to exit. In equilibrium, high-productivity firms offer high wages in order to poach workers from lower-paying firms and, therefore, grow faster. Relative to existing wageposting models, my environment includes capital as a factor of production as well as endogenous firm entry and exit. These ingredients are key: introducing capital allows the model to generate an empirically reasonable level for the labor share and free entry ensures that ex ante rents are exhausted.  \n\nI obtain an analytical solution for the stationary equilibirum of the model, which allows me to generate a number of new theoretical predictions. At the micro level, I show that firm-level labor shares are (asymptotically) decreasing in firm productivity.1 The reason is that the pass-through of productivity to wages is proportional to the (employmentweighted) density of firms. Firms in the right tail of the productivity distribution have few direct competitors and are therefore able to recruit and retain workers despite paying wages below the marginal product of labor. In contrast, the least productive firms pay wages that are above their marginal product and, therefore, have a high labor share. For these firms, the option value of retaining their workers compensates for the negative flow profits.  \n\nThe main theoretical contribution of the paper is to show that the aggregate labor share is decreasing in the level of productivity dispersion (i.e., the “thickness” of the right tail of the productivity distribution). To establish this result, I focus on a special case where the productivity distribution is Pareto and the discount rate is zero. I show that, all else equal, the aggregate labor share is decreasing in productivity dispersion. The intuition is that when firms in the right tail of the productivity distribution become “further apart\" in terms of productivity, they effectively face less competition, and thus earn higher monopsony profits. I also show that a key determinant of the sensitivity of the labor share to a change in productivity dispersion is the persistence of productivity differentials across firms. A more persistent productivity process implies a larger labor share decline in response to a rise in productivity dispersion. Intuitively, what matters is not only how large productivity differentials across firms are, but also how persistent they are.  \n\nIn Section 3, I calibrate and validate the model using administrative data covering the universe of corporations in Canada over the 2000-2015 period. The data set is ideal as it allows me to compute labor productivity, labor share, capital stock, and employment at the firm level. I calibrate the model by targeting moments related to the firm productivity process as well as the pace of job reallocation between firms. Despite being very parsimonious, the model matches a number of nontargeted (within-industry) moments. For example, the aggregate labor share is 0.62 (0.65 in the data) while the average (unweighted) firm labor share is 0.89 (0.88 in the data). The reason why the average labor share is so high is that the bottom 3 deciles of firms in terms of labor productivity have labor share above one (bottom two deciles in the data). The model also predicts that value-added is concentrated within high-productivity, low-labor-share firms: the top decile of firms in terms of labor productivity account for $55\\%$ ofoutput( $42\\%$ in the data) and have a labor share of 0.53 (0.44 in the data). Finally, I assess the ability of the model to match “panel moments” such as the pass-through of labor productivity to wages and find that the model provides a satisfactory fit.  \n\nIn Section 4.1, I use the calibrated model to simulate the effect of a rise in productivity dispersion. To motivate the model experiment, I show that, in recent decades, there has been a divergence between the U.S. and Canadian economies. Both productivity dispersion and the labor share have been stable in Canada, while the U.S. has experienced a rise in productivity dispersion coupled with a decline of the labor share.  \n\nThe model experiment consists of simulating the effect of a rise in productivity dispersion of the same magnitude as what the U.S. experienced over the 2000-2015 period. The model predicts a labor share decline of 1.3 percentage points. Using a shift-share decomposition, I show that the decline of the labor share in the model is mostly driven by a reallocation of value-added shares between firms, rather than a broad-based decline of firm-level labor shares. High-productivity firms experience an increase in their valueadded share as well as a decrease in their labor share. In contrast, low-productivity firms experience a decrease in their value-added share combined with an increase in their labor share. Through the lens of the model, roughly one quarter of the divergence between the Canadian and U.S. labor shares over the 2000-2015 period can be explained by differential trends in productivity dispersion.  \n\nThe micro predictions of the model are in line with what has been documented by Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen (2020) and Kehrig and Vincent (2021) using U.S. firm-level data. In particular, the model predicts that in response to an increase in productivity dispersion: (1) the aggregate labor share declines, (2) the decline is driven by a reallocation of value-added toward firms with a low (and declining) labor share, and (3) sales concentration increases.  \n\nIn Section 4.2, I compare the predictions of the model with regression evidence from cross-country and industry data. First, I use industry data from 69 Canadian 3-digit industries over the 2000-2015 period. I estimate cross-sectional, fixed effects, and longdifferences regression models. In all cases, I find that industries with high (rising) productivity dispersion have a low (declining) labor share. The results are robust to controlling for other factors such concentration (as in Barkai (2020), Autor et al. (2020)) and the capital-output ratio (as in Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014)). I also test the modelimplied mechanism by estimating the effect of productivity dispersion along the firm productivity distribution. As predicted by the model, a productivity dispersion shock has an asymmetric effect on firm labor shares and leads to a reallocation of value-added toward high-productivity firms. Second, I collect harmonized data on productivity dispersion and the labor share for 7 OECD countries over the 2001-2011 period and find quantitatively similar results.  \n\nFinally, in Section 5, I consider a number of model extensions (including the case with endogenous vacancy creation) in order to assess how sensitive the results of the model experiment are to different modeling choices. Overall, I find that the baseline model is somewhat conservative, in the sense that most of the model extensions considered imply a larger labor share decline in response to a rise in productivity dispersion.  \n\nThe Appendix to this paper (available in Online Supplementary Material (GouinBonenfant (2022)) contains all proofs and derivations as well as model extensions and robustnesschecks.  \n\n### RelatedLiterature  \n\nThe main contribution of this paper is to link the rise in productivity dispersion to the decline of the labor share, both theoretically and empirically.2 My theoretical results are related to a prior finding in Mangin (2017), who studies a search model where heterogeneous vacancies compete for unemployed workers via a second-price auction. Under some conditions, the author shows that the aggregate labor share is decreasing in the tail index (i.e., the inverse of the Pareto exponent) of the match-specific productivity distribution. Relative to this paper, my theoretical result emphasizes the role of firm dynamics. In particular, I show that what determines the aggregate labor share is not only the dispersion of productivity across firms, but also the persistence of these productivity differentials, as well as the pace of job reallocation between firms. In addition, I bring my model to rich firm-level data, which allows me to validate the model and then simulate the quantitative effect of a rise in productivity dispersion.  \n\nAnother related finding emerges in Hartman-Glaser, Lustig, and Xiaolan (2019), who study the link between the volatility of sales and the capital share in a firm dynamics model where risk-neutral firms insure risk-averse workers. Through the lens of their model, they find that an increase in firm-level risk generates an increase in the aggregate capital share. My mechanism differs in that productivity dispersion reduces the effective amount of competition faced by high-productivity firms, while they emphasize the insurance contract between workers and shareholders.  \n\nMy findings complement a growing literature that studies the importance of firm heterogeneity in shaping the decline of the U.S. labor share. Kehrig and Vincent (2021) focus on the manufacturing sector over the 1967-2012 period. They find that the decline of the labor share was driven by a reallocation of value-added toward firms with a low (and declining) labor share, but that there was limited reallocation of inputs (labor and capital). Autor et al. (2020) use data covering most sectors of the U.S. economy over the 1982-2012 period. They also find that the labor share decline was mostly driven by reallocation of market shares between firms, as opposed to a broad-based decline of labor shares within firms. In addition, they also show that industries that saw the largest increases in sales concentration also saw the largest declines in their labor shares. I contribute to this literature by providing (i) new evidence on the relationship between labor share and labor productivity at the firm-level, (ii) a theory that can explain the large heterogeneity in labor shares across firms, and (i) a new mechanism that generates a “reallocation-driven\" labor share decline.  \n\nMy paper contributes to the literature on the labor share by studying the aggregate effects of search frictions. Jarosch, Nimczik, and Sorkin (2019) study a “granular” search model, where wages are determined by Nash bargaining. The main difference with my paper is that they study market power as arising due to firm size, while in my model there is no market power in the traditional sense (firms are atomistic).3 Instead, I focus on the rent-sharing problem between workers and firms, and in particular how productivity dispersion affects the optimal wage-setting decision of firms.  \n\nRelative to the frictional monopsony literature—which studies how monopsony power arises in the presence of search frictions and wage posting—my main contribution is to establish a theoretical link between productivity dispersion and the aggregate labor share and to quantify its importance.4 The most closely related papers are Bontemps, Robin, and Van den Berg (2000) and Cahuc, Postel-Vinay, and Robin (2006). Both papers structurally estimate search models using French administrative data on wages and firm productivity. Cahuc, Postel-Vinay, and Robin (2006) quantifies the contributions of bargaining power and between-firm competition in raising wages above the value of unemployment. They find that between-firm competition is the most important factor. Bontemps, Robin, and Van den Berg (2000) use a wage-posting model and find that highproductivity firms exert more monopsony power, which is closely related to my finding that high-productivity firms have a lower labor share. Compared to these papers, who focus on the distribution of wages, my paper focuses on the aggregate labor share, and in particular how productivity dispersion affects the aggregate profit share.  \n\nMy model differs from most existing wage-posting models in that it incorporates firm dynamics (endogenous entry, exit, and growth). Existing firm dynamics models with search frictions include Elsby and Michaels (2013), Kaas and Kircher (2015), Coles and Mortensen (2016), Gavazza, Mongey, and Violante (2018), Elsby and Gottfries (2021), Bilal, Engbom, Mongey, and Violante (2019). My model is most closely related to Coles and Mortensen (2016) (henceforth Coles-Mortensen).  \n\nIn terms of the environment, my model differs from Coles-Mortensen along three main dimensions. First, I add capital as a factor of production. Payments to capital affect the share of value-added that accrues to workers. Second, I model the entry and exit decision of firms, while Coles-Mortensen assumes that firm productivity is high enough so that firms always make positive profits and, therefore, always wish to enter and never wish to exit. Free entry ensures that ex ante rents are exhausted (i.e., the marginal entrant makes zero profits in expectation), thereby limiting the amount of profits in equilibrium. Moreover, endogenous exit allows the model to rationalize the existence of temporary negative profits (an important feature of the data). Finally, Coles-Mortensen model the hiring process using a hiring cost function. Instead, I assume “\"balanced matching” as in Burdett and Vishwanath (1988) (i.e., exogenous meeting rates that are proportional to firm size), which delivers analytical tractability and allows me to obtain my main theoretical results.5 Finally, in Section 5.3, I relax the balanced matching assumption by considering a model extension with endogenous vacancy-posting.  \n\n## 2. THEORY  \n\nI now present the baseline model. I start by describing the environment and assumptions, paying particular attention to dimensions in which it differs from Burdett and Mortensen (1998) and Coles and Mortensen (2016). The key theoretical results are in Section 2.3, where I obtain model predictions regarding the effect of productivity dispersion on the aggregate labor share.  \n\n### 2.1. Environment  \n\nThe economy is populated by an endogenous measure $F$ of heterogeneous firms and a unit measure of identical, infinitely-lived workers. Firms and workers are risk neutral and discount the future using an exogenous discount rate $r>0$ Time is continuous.  \n\n#### Technology  \n\nFirms compete for workers by posting wage contracts $w$ in a frictional labor market and rent capital in a perfectly competitive market at user cost $R\\equiv r+d$ where $d\\geq0$ is the depreciation rate of capital. Firms can change the wage policy at any time and cannot commit to future wages. I assume that firms are required to pay all of their workers the same wage. Workers can be either employed or unemployed and are available to receive job offers in both states. The flow value of unemployment is exogenous and given by $b>0$  \n\nFirm output $Y$ is given by a constant return to scale Cobb-Douglas production function  \n\n$$\nY=z K^{\\alpha}N^{1-\\alpha},\n$$  \n\nwhere $z$ is productivity, $\\alpha\\in[0,1)$ is the capital share, $N\\geq0$ is the measure of workers that the firm employs, and $K\\geq0$ is the capital stock.  \n\nFirm-level productivity $z$ obeys a jump process. At Poisson rate $\\chi>0$ , continuing firms draw a new productivity level from an exogenous distribution $\\Gamma_{0}$ .6 Firm productivity thus remains constant for a stochastic duration and then jumps to a new level that is independent from the previous one. I assume that $\\Gamma_{0}$ satisfies the following conditions.  \n\nAsSUMPTION 1: The productivity distribution $\\Gamma_{0}:\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\rightarrow[0,1]$ is differentiable and satisfies  \n\n$$\n\\Gamma_{0}^{\\prime}(z)>0,\\qquad\\int_{0}^{\\infty}z\\Gamma_{0}^{\\prime}(z)\\mathrm{d}z=1,\\qquad\\int_{0}^{\\infty}z^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}\\Gamma_{0}^{\\prime}(z)\\mathrm{d}z<\\infty.\n$$  \n\nThe first condition ensures that the density is strictly positive everywhere, the second condition is a normalization, and the third condition ensures that aggregate output is finite. For example, the third condition rules out Pareto distributions with exponents smaller than -α·  \n\n#### Firm Dynamics and Matching  \n\nAt Poisson rate $\\mu>0$ , an unemployed worker meets a potential firm. The potential firm then draws a productivity level $z\\sim\\Gamma_{0}$ and decides whether or not to enter. Continuing firms meet new workers at rate $\\lambda N$ , where the meeting rate $\\lambda>0$ is a technological parameter and $N$ is the measure of workers currently employed. This assumption represents a departure form the canonical Burdett and Mortensen (1998) model, who assume that firms meet workers at a rate that is independent of size. Burdett and Vishwanath (1988) call this linear meeting rate “balanced matching.”\" (In Section 5.3, I extend the model to allow for endogenous vacancy-posting and show that balanced matching arises a limiting case.)  \n\nMatching is random, which implies that a fraction $u$ of meetings are with unemployed workers while the remainder $1-u$ are with employed workers, where $u$ is the unemployment rate. When a firm meets a worker, the worker only observes the wage posted by the firm and decides whether or not to accept the job offer. At Poisson rate $\\delta\\geq0$ continuing workers exogenously separate to unemployment. At any moment, a firm can choose to exit and send all of its workers to unemployment.  \n\nTogether, the assumptions of (i) constant return to scale in production, (ii) balanced matching, and (i) the jump process for firm productivity allow me to obtain an analytical characterization of the stationary equilibrium of the model. As we will see shortly, the reason is that the firm problem becomes homogeneous (firm size is not a payoff relevant state variable) and that the stationary distribution is the solution to a quadratic equation.  \n\n#### Strategies and Beliefs  \n\nWhen an employed worker receives an offer from a competing firm, she must form expectations about the future path of wages at both firms and choose the alternative with the highest continuation value. To make the analysis tractable, I restrict attention to Markov strategies that depend only on productivity. Denote by $w(z)$ the wage offered by a firm with productivity $z$ $e(z)\\in\\{0,1\\}$ the entry decision of a potential firm, and $x(z)\\in\\{0,1\\}$ the exit decision of a continuing firm. As in Coles and Mortensen (2016), I focus on equilibria where firm strategies do not depend directly on size. This is a natural choice given that the firm problem is homogeneous.  \n\n#### Distributions  \n\nTwo related distributions will play a central role in my analysis: the employmentweighted productivity distribution $P(z)$ and the wage distribution $\\tilde{P}(w)$ .The employmentweighted productivity distribution summarizes the allocation of workers to firms of different productivity levels. Its definition is that, for a given productivity level $z$ ashare  \n\n$P(z)\\in[0,1]$ of workers are at firms with productivity less than $z$ . When more productive firms pay strictly higher wages (i.e., $w^{\\prime}(z)>0$ )—as will be the case in equilibrium—-the following relationship holds:  \n\n$$\nP(z)={\\widetilde{P}}{\\big(}w(z){\\big)}.\n$$  \n\nIn words, it says that the share of workers at frms with productivity less than $z$ is equal to the share of workers earning a wage below $w(z)$  \n\n#### Worker Problem  \n\nDenote by $U$ the value of being unemployed and by $W(w)$ the value of being employed at a firm currently paying wage a $w$ . The value functions are the solutions to standard Bellman equations:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\nabla}U=b+\\underbrace{\\mu\\int e(z)\\big|W\\big(w(z)\\big)-U\\big|_{+}\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma_{0}(z)}_{\\mathrm{iohoffershwenterinefrm}}+\\underbrace{\\lambda(1-u)\\int\\big|W\\big(w(z)\\big)-U\\big|_{+}\\mathrm{d}P(z),}_{\\mathrm{iohoffershwcontininefrm}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $|x|_{+}\\equiv\\operatorname*{max}\\{x,0\\}$ , for any variable $x$ . The first term on the right-hand side of (3) accounts for the fow value of unemployment $^b$ while the second and third terms account for job offers by entering and continuing firms.  \n\n$$\nr W(w)=w+\\chi\\int\\big(1-x(z)\\big)\\big(W\\big(w(z^{\\prime})\\big)-W(w)\\big)\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma_{0}\\big(z^{\\prime}\\big)\n$$  \n\nThe first term on the right-hand side of (4) accounts for the flow of wages, the second term accounts for wage changes due to firm productivity shocks, the third term accounts for job offers by continuing firms, and the fourth term accounts for job destruction. Given that employed workers can quit to unemployment, the value of being employed must be weakly greater than the value of being unemployed:  \n\n$$\nW(w)\\geq U.\n$$  \n\nProposition 1 characterizes the best response of workers to firms decision rules $w(z)$ $e(z)$ ,and $x(z)$ along an equilibrium path.  \n\nPROPOSITION 1: Unemployed workers accept a job offer if and only if it exceeds a reservationwage w given by  \n\n$$\n\\underline{{w}}=b+\\int\\big(\\mu e(z)-\\chi\\big(1-x(z)\\big)\\big)\\big(W\\big(w(z)\\big)-U\\big)\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma_{0}(z).\n$$  \n\nEmployed workers accept a job offer if and only if it exceeds their current wage. They quit to unemployment if and only if their current wage falls below w.  \n\n#### Firm Growth  \n\nEquipped with the workers? decision rule, I now characterize the link between firmlevel wage and employment growth. The instantaneous change in employment at a firm of size $N$ paying $w\\geq w$ is givenby  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}N_{t}=\\widetilde{g}(w_{t})N_{t}\\mathrm{d}t,\n$$  \n\nwhere the employment growth function of continuing firms $\\widetilde g(w)$ is an endogenous object that depends on the wage distribution $\\widetilde{P}(w)$ . A simple expression can be obtained for the employment growth function.  \n\nLEMMA 1: For all $w\\geq w$ , the employment growth function is given by  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{g}(w)\\equiv\\underbrace{\\lambda u+\\lambda(1-u)\\widetilde{P}(w)}_{h i r i n g r a t e}-\\underbrace{\\lambda(1-u)\\big(1-\\widetilde{P}(w)\\big)-\\delta}_{s e p a r a t i o n r a t e}.\n$$  \n\nThe function $\\widetilde g(\\cdot)$ is weakly increasing and bounded from above by $\\lambda-\\delta$  \n\nLemma 1 highlights two important predictions of the model. First, high-wage firms grow faster. The reason is that offering a higher wage increases net poaching fows (i.e., the net amount of workers poached from other firms). Second, the marginal benefit of increasing the wage eventually converges to zero. To understand why, consider the case of a firm that offers the highest wage in the economy. Note that this firm is able to hire every worker that it meets and loses none of its workers to other firms. Hence, increasing the wage further would not lead to a higher growth rate of employment.  \n\nASSUMPTION 2: The exogenous rates $(\\lambda,\\chi,\\mu,\\delta)$ satisfy  \n\n$$\n0<\\lambda-\\delta<\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\chi,\\mu\\}\n$$  \n\nAssumption 2 is a sufficient condition for the existence of a steady-state unemployment rate and a well-defined employment-weighted productivity distribution (more on that in Section 2.2). The intuition is that if $\\lambda-\\delta\\geq\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\chi,\\mu\\}$ some firms would grow too fast for too long. As a result, the stationary firm size distribution would have an infinite mean.  \n\n#### FirmProblem  \n\nAt every instant, the problem of a firm is to choose the current wage level $w$ ,the amount of capital per worker $k$ , and whether to exit or continue operating. Given the constant return to scale assumption in both production and matching, the firm problem is homogeneous. Without loss of generality, I will characterize the value of a firm with a unit measure of employment $\\upsilon(z)\\equiv\\upsilon(z,1)$  \n\nIn the productivity region where the value of the firm is positive, the value function is the solution to the following Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation:  \n\n$$\nr v(z)=\\operatorname*{max}_{w\\geq b,k\\geq0}\\underbrace{\\big\\{z k^{\\alpha}-w-R k}_{\\mathrm{~proftis}}+\\underbrace{v(z)\\widetilde{g}(w)}_{\\mathrm{~growth~}}\\big\\}}_{\\mathrm{~.~}}+\\underbrace{\\chi\\bigg(\\int v(x)\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma_{0}(x)-v(z)\\bigg)}_{\\mathrm{~.~}}.\n$$  \n\nIn the productivity region where the value of the firm is negative, the firm decides to exit.7  \n\nThe first-order conditions for capital and wages are respectively given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\underbrace{z\\alpha k^{\\alpha-1}}_{\\mathrm{marginalproduct}}=\\underbrace{R}_{\\mathrm{usercost}},\\ {\\underbrace{\\mathrm{of~capital}}_{\\mathrm{l}}}\\ {\\underbrace{1}_{\\mathrm{narginalincrease}}=\\underbrace{v(z)\\widetilde{g}^{\\prime}(w)}_{\\mathrm{more:seal~i.}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe first-order condition for capital is standard and implies that firms rent capital up to the point where the marginal product of capital is equal to its user cost. The first-order condition for wages captures the trade-off between current profits and future growth. When a firm offers a high wage, it makes lower per-employee profit but grows faster, which increases the present value of future profits. The following proposition provides closed-form expressions for the policy functions.  \n\nPROPOSITION 2: Capital per worker $k(z)$ , the wage schedule $w(z)$ , the entry decision $e(z)$ and the exit decision $x(z)$ are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle k(z)=\\alpha^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}R^{-\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}z^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}},}}\\ {{\\displaystyle w(z)=\\underline{{{w}}}+\\int_{z}^{z}v(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\mathrm{d}x,}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\ne(z)=1\\{z\\geq{\\underline{{z}}}\\},\\qquadx(z)=1\\{z<{\\underline{{z}}}\\},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\underline{{z}}\\geq0$ is a threshold. Capital per worker and wages are increasing in productivity $z$  \n\nDenote the equilibrium growth rate of employment by $g(z)\\equiv\\widetilde{g}(w(z))$ . Combining the expression for $\\widetilde g(w)$ (see equation (8) and the definition of the employment-weighted productivity distribution $P(z)$ in the case where $w^{\\prime}(z)>0$ (see equation (2)), I obtain  \n\n$$\ng(z)=\\lambda u+\\lambda(1-u)P(z)-\\lambda(1-u)\\bigl(1-P(z)\\bigr)-\\delta.\n$$  \n\nLabor productivity $y(z)$ is defined as valued-added per worker while the labor share $\\operatorname{LS}(z)$ is defined as payroll over value-added:  \n\n$$\ny(z)\\equiv z k(z)^{\\alpha},\\qquad\\mathrm{LS}(z)=w(z)/y(z).\n$$  \n\n7 More generally, the value function is the solution to a linear complementarity problem:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{r v(z)\\geq\\underset{w\\geq b,k\\geq0}{\\operatorname*{max}}\\left\\lbrace z k^{\\alpha}-w-R k+v(z)\\widetilde{g}(w)\\right\\rbrace+\\chi\\bigg(\\int v(x)\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma_{0}(x)-v(z)\\bigg),}\\ &{r v(z)\\geq0,}\\ &{\\qquad0=v(z)\\bigg(r v(z)-\\underset{w\\geq b,k\\geq0}{\\operatorname*{max}}\\left\\lbrace z k^{\\alpha}-w-R k+v(z)\\widetilde{g}(w)\\right\\rbrace-\\chi\\bigg(\\int v(x)\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma_{0}(x)-v(z)\\bigg)\\bigg).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe inequalities (10) and (11) ensure that the annuity value of a firm $r v(z)$ is never less than the continuation value or the exit value. Equation (12) requires that either the value of a firm is zero, or that its annuity value is equal to its continuation value. Alternatively, the value function can be characterized as the solution to a variational inequality of the obstacle type (see Achdou, Buera, Lasry, Lions, and Moll (2014)).  \n\n### 2.2. Equilibrium  \n\nI now define and solve the equilibrium of the model. To simplify the notation, I define the flow of entering firms $\\mu_{e}$ , the firm exit rate $\\chi_{x}$ , the rate of arrival of productivity shocks $\\chi_{s}$ , and the productivity distribution of active firms $\\Gamma(z)$ as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\mu_{e}\\equiv\\mu\\bigl(1-\\Gamma_{0}(\\underline{{{z}}})\\bigr),\\qquad\\chi_{x}\\equiv\\chi\\Gamma_{0}(\\underline{{{z}}}),}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\chi_{s}\\equiv\\chi\\bigl(1-\\Gamma_{0}(\\underline{{{z}}})\\bigr),\\qquad\\Gamma(z)\\equiv\\frac{\\Gamma_{0}(z)-\\Gamma_{0}(\\underline{{{z}}})}{1-\\Gamma_{0}(\\underline{{{z}}})}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn Appendix A.4, I provide a derivation of the following laws of motion for the unemployment rate $u$ and the employment-weighted distribution $P(z)$  \n\n$$\n\\dot{u}=\\underbrace{(\\delta+\\chi_{x})}_{\\substack{\\mathrm{~\\tiny~(~1~-~}u)}}-u\\big(\\mu_{e}+\\lambda(1-u)\\big),\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\dot{P}(z)=\\underbrace{(1-u)\\lambda P(z)\\bigl(P(z)-1\\bigr)}_{\\substack{(1-u})}+\\frac{u}{1-u}\\mu_{e}\\Gamma(z)+u\\lambda P(z)\n$$  \n\n#### Equilibrium Definition  \n\nA stationary equilibrium consists of a productivity distribution $\\Gamma(z)$ , rates $(\\mu_{e},\\chi_{s},\\chi_{x})$ ， value functions for the worker $(U,W(w))$ , a reservation wage $\\underline{w}$ , a value function for the firm $v(z)$ , a productivity threshold $\\underline{{z}}$ , decision rules for the firm $(w(z),k(z))$ , an unemployment rate $u$ , and an employment-weighted productivity distribution $P(z)$ that satisfy: (i) the truncated productivity distribution $\\Gamma(z)$ and rates $\\mu_{e},\\chi_{s},\\chi_{x}$ are determined by the optimal entry and exit of firms (20), (ii) the value functions for the worker $U$ ， $W(w)$ solve (3), (4), (i) the reservation wage $\\underline{w}$ solves the worker problem (6), (iv) the value function $v(z)$ and productivity threshold $\\underline{{\\boldsymbol{z}}}$ solve the linear complementarity problem (10), (11), (12), (v) the decision rules $k(z)$ and $w(z)$ solve the firm problem (15), (16), and (vi) the unemployment rate $u$ and the employment-weighted productivity distribution $P(z)$ are the stationary solutions to their respective laws of motion (21), (22).  \n\n#### Solution  \n\nThe following proposition provides an expression for the unemployment rate $u$ and the employment-weighted productivity distribution $P(z)$ in a stationary equilibrium.  \n\nPROPOsITION 3: There exist a unique pair of unemployment rate u and employmentweighteddistribution $P(z)$ that are stationary solutions to their respective laws of motion (equations (21) and (22)):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{u=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\lambda+\\delta+\\chi_{x}+\\mu_{e}-\\sqrt{(\\lambda+\\delta+\\chi_{x}+\\mu_{e})^{2}-4\\lambda(\\chi_{x}+\\delta)}}{2\\lambda},}\\ {P(z)=\\big(\\lambda(1-u)+\\chi+\\delta-u\\lambda}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{-\\sqrt{\\big(\\lambda(1-u)+\\chi+\\delta-\\lambda u\\big)^{2}-4\\lambda(1-u)(\\chi+\\delta-u\\lambda)\\Gamma(z)\\big)}}}\\ {{}}\\ {{/\\big(2\\lambda(1-u)\\big).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe fact that wages are increasing in firm productivity (see Proposition 2) implies that the equilibrium exhibits rank preservation: the ranking of wages across firms is the same as the ranking of productivity. As in Burdett and Mortensen (1998) and Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2013), it is the rank-preserving property of the model that yields tractability.  \n\nA corollary of Proposition 3 is that the allocation of workers to firm productivity ranks is invariant to the underlying productivity distribution $\\Gamma(\\cdot)$ . For example, the share of workers working at firms with productivity below $z^{\\prime}$ depends only on $(\\lambda,\\chi,\\delta,u)$ and the firm rank $\\Gamma(z^{\\prime})\\in[0,1]$ , but not on the absolute productivity level $z^{\\prime}$ . The feature of the equilibrium that generates this result is that the optimal quit decision of worker is ordinal; they accept any job offer that generates a wage increase.  \n\nAsSUMPTION 3: The value of unemployment $^b$ is high enough so that $v(\\underline{{z}})=0$  \n\nFrom now on, I will focus on the case where the value of unemployment $^b$ is “high enough.\" For low values of $^b$ , it could be that firms with $z=0$ can profitably operate (i.e., $v(0)>0,$ 0, which would imply that there is no firm exit. Assumption 3 contrasts with Coles and Mortensen (2016), who assume that the lower bound of the productivity distribution is such that all firms make positive profits in every date and state, which implies $v(\\underline{{z}})>0$  \n\n### 2.3. Micro and Macro Predictions  \n\nI now derive predictions regarding the link between (i) productivity and labor share at the firm level and (i) productivity dispersion and the aggregate labor share. Before doing so, I provide intuition regarding the equilibrium relationship between wages and productivity at the firm level.  \n\n#### Intuition  \n\nThe first-order condition for capital (13) implies that the share of payments to capital in value-added $R k(z)/y(z)$ is equal to the output elasticity of capital $\\alpha$ . The equilibrium wage $w(z)$ thus determines how the remaining $1-\\alpha$ share of value-added is split between wages and profits. The first-order condition for wages (14) evaluated at the equilibrium wage yields the following equation for the pass-through of productivity to wages:  \n\n$$\nw^{\\prime}(z)=\\underbrace{g^{\\prime}(z)}_{\\mathrm{growtheffect}}\\times\\underbrace{v(z)}_{\\mathrm{valueeffec}}\n$$  \n\nWhen a firm's productivity increases, the marginal increase in the wage offered is exactly equal to the marginal increase in the value of the firm. The value of the firm increases because (i) higher wages imply a higher growth rate (the growth effect) and (ii) the firm extracts rents from every additional worker (the value effect). Using equation (18), the growth effect can be further decomposed into two terms  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{g^{\\prime}(z)=\\underbrace{2\\lambda(1-u)}_{\\substack{\\mathrm{~\\displaystyle~\\left(~\\lambda~-~\\mu~)~}}}\\times\\quad\\underbrace{P^{\\prime}(z)}_{\\substack{\\mathrm{~\\displaystyle~\\left(~\\lambda~-~\\mu~)~}}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFirst, search frictions mitigate the effect of wages on net poaching fows. For instance, the growth effect is lower if the meeting rate $\\lambda$ is low or the unemployment rate $u$ is high. Second, the extent to which a wage increase yields higher net poaching fows depends on the density of workers working at firms with productivity $z$ . At the margin, a wage increase only affects the quit behavior of workers who were initially indifferent between staying or quitting. Since $P^{\\prime}(z)$ is a density, it must be that $P^{\\prime}(z)\\to0$ , so firms in the upper tail of the productivity distribution face vanishing wage competition and, therefore, have no incentive to pass productivity gains to their workers.  \n\nThe fact that high-productivity firms tend to make higher profits has been discussed in Bontemps, Robin, and Van den Berg (2000) in the context of the standard BurdettMortensen model. A unique prediction of my model—which arises due to the interaction between productivity shocks and the endogenous exit decision—is that low-productivity firms pay wages that are above the static marginal product of labor. Rearranging the Bellman equation (9), the value to the firm of a worker can be decomposed into the flow profits and an option value  \n\n$$\nv(z)=\\frac{1}{r+\\chi_{x}-g(z)}\\Bigg[\\underbrace{(1-\\alpha)y(z)-w(z)}_{\\mathrm{flowprofits}}+\\underbrace{\\chi_{s}\\bigg(\\int v(x)\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma(x)-v(z)\\bigg)}_{\\mathrm{optionvalue}}\\Bigg].\n$$  \n\nEvaluating at $z=\\underline{{z}}$ and using the fact that $v(\\underline{{z}})=0$ (Assumption 3), I obtain an expression for the equilibrium wage of the lowest productivity firm:  \n\n$$\n{\\underline{{w}}}=(1-\\alpha)y({\\underline{{z}}})+\\chi_{s}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}v(x)\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma(x).\n$$  \n\nNotice that workers at firms with $z=\\underline{{z}}$ extracts all the surplus from the match, including the option value of future productivity increases. As a result, they earn a wage that exceeds their static marginal product.  \n\n#### Firm-Level LaborShares  \n\nThe following proposition characterizes the relationship between productivity and labor share at the firm level.  \n\nPROPOsITION 4—Micro: There exists a threshold $z^{\\prime}$ such that firms with $z<z^{\\prime}$ have a labor share above the frictionless benchmark (i.e., $\\mathrm{LS}(z)>1-\\alpha)$ . There exists a second threshold $z^{\\prime\\prime}$ such that for firms with $z>z^{\\prime\\prime}$ , the labor share is decreasing in productivity (i.e., $\\mathrm{LS}^{\\prime}(z)<0\\AA$  \n\nFigure 1a presents the relationship between the labor share and labor productivity in a numerical example. In contrast with the frictionless model where the labor share would be $1-\\alpha$ for every firm, the model predicts that the labor share of high-productivity firms is lower than $1-\\alpha$ , while the opposite is true for low-productivity firms.  \n\n#### Aggregation  \n\nThe aggregate labor share is equal to the output-weighted average of firm-level labor shares. I now use the analytical solution of the stationary equilibrium to obtain an expression for the aggregate labor share.  \n\n![](images/815acea88554145a4473b5ead72d512379347bae043fef0620653629e3353ebd.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1.—-Relationship between labor share and productivity (numerical example)  \n\nPROPOSITION 5—Aggregation: The aggregate labor share is given by where $\\begin{array}{r}{\\overline{{g}}\\equiv\\int_{\\underline{{z}}}^{\\infty}g(z)\\mathrm{d}P(z)}\\end{array}$ is the average growth rate of continuing firms and $\\mathbf{Y}\\equiv$ $\\begin{array}{r}{\\int_{\\underline{{z}}}^{\\infty}y(z)\\mathrm{d}P(z)}\\end{array}$ is aggregate output.  \n\nNotice that output shares are increasing in productivity $z$ 8 The reason is twofold. First, high-productivity firms tend to employ more workers (i.e., their employment share is higher). Second, they produce more output per worker (i.e., their relative productivity is higher). The aggregate labor share is thus disproportionately determined by the labor share of high-productivity firms.  \n\nTo study the link between the distribution of productivity $\\Gamma(z)$ and the aggregate labor share, I now restrict attention to a tractable special case that yields a closed-form solution. In particular, I assume that the discount rate $r$ is equal to zero and that the distribution of productivity is Pareto (i.e., $\\Gamma_{0}(z)=1-z^{-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}.$ 0. The parameter $\\sigma$ governs the thickness of the right tail of the productivity distribution. Since the variance of the logarithm of productivity $z$ is precisely $\\sigma$ , I refer to $\\sigma$ as “productivity dispersion.” Assumption 1 requires that α< α·  \n\nPROPOSITION 6—-Pareto special case with no discounting: Suppose that $\\Gamma_{0}(z)=1-z^{-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}$ for $z\\geq1$ and $r=0$ . The aggregate labor share is given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}=1-\\alpha-\\frac{\\chi_{x}-\\overline{{g}}}{\\chi-\\overline{{g}}}\\sigma,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\chi_{x}-\\overline{{g}}}{\\chi-\\overline{{g}}}\\in(0,1)}\\end{array}$ which implies that $\\mathrm{LS}\\in(0,1-\\alpha)$  \n\nThe key takeaway is that, all else constant, the aggregate labor share is decreasing in productivity dispersion $\\sigma$ . The Cobb-Douglas exponent $\\alpha$ determines the share of payments to capital while productivity dispersion $\\sigma$ is a key determinant of how the remaining $1-\\alpha$ share of aggregate value-added is split between wages and profits. Notice that freeentry exhausts ex ante rents, so that without productivity dispersion (i.e., $\\sigma=0$ ), there would be no ex post profits.?  \n\nTo understand why the aggregate labor share is decreasing in productivity dispersion, recall from (26) that the pass-through of productivity to wages is proportional to the amount of local competition that a firm faces (i.e., the density of workers at firms with a similar productivity level). An increase in productivity dispersion $\\sigma$ makes firms become \"further apart\" in terms of productivity, effectively weakening between-firm competition in the labor market.  \n\nFinally, notice that the persistence of the productivity process $\\chi$ affects both the level of the aggregate labor share as well as its sensitivity to productivity dispersion $\\sigma$ . All else equal, if productivity differentials between firms were purely transitory (i.e., $\\chi\\rightarrow+\\infty$ ， the labor share would converge to the frictionless case $\\mathrm{LS}=1-\\alpha$ ,where aggregate profits are zero. In that case, productivity dispersion would not affect the labor share. If instead productivity differentials across firms were permanent (i.e., $\\chi=0$ ), then the labor share would converge to $1-\\alpha-\\sigma$ Therefore, what matters for the share of profits in GDP is not only how far apart firms are in terms of productivity, but how persistent these productivity differentials are.  \n\n#### Comparison With Benchmark Models  \n\nI now contrast the prediction of the baseline model with two benchmark models. First, I consider an extension of the model in (Burdett and Mortensen (1998)) with capital (henceforth “Burdett-Mortensen\"). The main difference with the baseline model is that productivity differentials are permanent instead of being mean-reverting. Second, I consider a variation of the Coles and Mortensen (2016) model with capital and balanced matching (henceforth “Coles-Mortensen\"). The only difference with the baseline model is that entry and exit is exogenous. Note that the original model developed in Coles and Mortensen (2016) does not have balanced matching, but instead has a convex hiring cost function. I study the implications of costly hiring (i.e., endogenous vacancy-posting) separately in Section 5.3.  \n\nTable I contains closed-form expressions for the aggregate labor share in the Pareto special case with no discounting for each benchmark model. First, notice that the labor share in the baseline model is higher than in the Coles-Mortensen model. The reason is that, in the baseline model, endogenous entry exhausts rents up to the point where the marginal entrant has a continuation value of zero (i.e., $v(\\underline{{z}})=0$ 0. In Coles-Mortensen, entry is exogenous and all firms make weakly positive fow profits, which implies that $v(\\underline{{z}})>0$ . As a result, profits are higher in Coles-Mortensen and the labor share is lower.  \n\nTABLEI PARETOSPECIALCASE WITH NODISCOUNTING:COMPARISONWITHBENCHMARK MODELS.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Aggregate labor share</td></tr><tr><td>Frictionless</td><td>1-α</td></tr><tr><td>Baselinemodel</td><td>1-α- Xx-g</td></tr><tr><td>Coles-Mortensen</td><td>x-g 1-α-( Xx-gXs</td></tr><tr><td>Burdett-Mortensen</td><td>X-g 1-α-α</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: The models are ranked according to their aggregate labor share, from highest to lowest. See Appendix B for a formal derivation of the ColesMortensen and BurdetMortensen models. “Productivity dispersion $\\sigma$ is the inverse of the Pareto exponent; $\\overline{{g}}\\equiv\\lambda u-\\delta$ is the average growth rate of continuing firms; $\\underline{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}\\equiv-\\lambda(1-2\\boldsymbol{u})-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ is the growth rate of firms with $z=\\underline{{z}}$  \n\nSecond, the labor share in Burdett-Mortensen is the lowest of all models considered. To understand why, notice that the labor share in the Burdett-Mortensen model coincides with the labor share in the baseline model when there is no mean-reversion in productivity (i.e., $\\chi=0$ ). As discussed earlier, a high persistence of productivity differentials reduces the labor share in favor of profits.  \n\nThe main takeaway from Table I is that both endogenous entry and mean-reversion in firm productivity reduce the amount of rents that accrue to firms. As a result, these model ingredients generate a higher labor share (i.e., closer to the frictionless benchmark) and a lower sensitivity of the labor share to productivity dispersion. Figure 1b contains a numerical example where the aggregate labor share is shown as a function of productivity dispersion (keeping everything else constant).  \n\nWhile the results in Table I are obtained under strong assumptions (i.e., a Pareto distribution and zero discounting), they provide theoretical guidance as to which model parameters are important: the capital share $\\alpha$ , the productivity process $(\\sigma,\\chi)$ , and the pace of job reallocation between firms $({\\overline{{g}}},\\chi_{x})$ . In the next section, I conduct a quantitative analysis of the model where all functional forms and parameter values are disciplined by moments in the data.  \n\n## 3. QUANTIFYING THE THEORY  \n\n### 3.1. Calibration  \n\nI calibrate the model to the Canadian economy over the 2000-2015 period. As in the U.S., the Canadian labor share is now lower than it was in the 1980s but, unlike in the U.S., the Canadian labor share appears to have been quite stable since 2000 (see Appendix D.2). I will thus compare the 2000-2015 period to the stationary equilibrium of the model.  \n\n#### Data  \n\nI use microdata from the National Accounts Longitudinal Microdata File (henceforth \"NALMF\"), which is constructed by merging administrative data from different sources.  \n\nThe NALMF contains de-identified data covering the universe of private sector employers in Canada 0ver the 2000-2015 period. The unit of observation is an enterprise, which is an entity larger than an establishment but smaller than a consolidated corporation.10 Unlike with establishments, these entities have a full set of income statement and balance sheets, which makes it possible to construct firm-level measures of value-added.  \n\nI restrict the main sample to the private corporate sector excluding: agriculture, mining, utilities, education, and health (i.e., NAICS 11, 21, 22, 61, and 62). Agriculture and mining are excluded due to data limitations while utilities, education, and health are excluded due to the fact that these sectors are dominated by public entities in Canada. Finally, I restrict the sample to firm-year observations with more than 5 employees that have no missing values in employment, value-added, capital stock, and industry code.  \n\nThe data allows me to compute value-added at the firm level using the same methodology as in the System of National Accounts. Using the income approach, I construct valueadded as the sum of worker compensation (i.e., income that accrues to workers) and gross profit (i.e., income that accrues to firm owners). I can then compute the labor share as the ratio of worker compensation to value-added. Labor productivity is defined as the ratio of value-added to employment. In Appendix D.1, I describe the variable construction in more details and provide summary statistics. The final sample contains 3,084,182 firmyear observations, with an average of 192,761 firms per year.  \n\n#### Productivity Distribution  \n\nI model the productivity distribution $\\Gamma_{0}(z)$ as a Gamma distribution with a mean normalized to one. The Gamma distribution has both a thick upper tail and a cusp, which is consistent with the typical shape of productivity distributions in the data. The resulting distribution is fully characterized by a single shape parameter $\\eta>0$ that governs the thickness of the upper tail, where a lower $\\eta$ implies a thicker tail.11 As I show in Appendix C.3, the Gamma distribution provides a good fit for the empirical distribution of productivity, while the Pareto distribution assumed in Proposition 6 generates too much skewness. In Section 5.4, I consider an alternative calibration of the baseline model where $\\Gamma_{0}(z)$ is a Pareto distribution.  \n\n#### Externally Calibrated Parameters  \n\nThe model has nine parameters. I externally calibrate the first three $(r,d,\\alpha)$ and internally calibrate the last six $(\\lambda,\\mu,\\delta,b,\\chi,\\eta)$ . I interpret a time period $[t,t+1)$ in the model to be a year. The value of $r$ is chosen to imply an annual discount rate of $5\\%$ . For the depreciation rate $d$ , I obtain a target by using industry-level data from Statistics Canada (Table 031-0006, linear depreciation). For the set of industries covered in the main sample, the average annual depreciation rate over the 2000-2015 period is $14.8\\%$ . Finally, I set $\\alpha=0.230$ to match the capital-output ratio of 1.10 measured in the NALMF data. Table II summarizes these choices. To map discrete-time growth rates $g_{d}$ in the data to continuoustime growth rates $g_{c}$ in the model, I use the conversion formula $g_{c}=\\log(1+g_{d})$ .12  \n\nTABLEII EXTERNALLY CALIBRATED PARAMETERS.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter</td><td>Symbol</td><td>Value</td><td>Target</td></tr><tr><td>Interestrate</td><td>r</td><td>0.049</td><td>Annualdiscountrateof5%</td></tr><tr><td>Depreciationrate</td><td>d</td><td>0.160</td><td>Annual depreciation rate of 14.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Capital share</td><td></td><td>0.230</td><td>Capital stock to annual output ratio of 1.10</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### Internally Calibrated Parameters  \n\nThe remaining parameters $\\theta\\equiv(\\lambda,\\mu,\\delta,b,\\chi,\\eta)^{\\prime}$ are jointly calibrated. I target moments from the data and choose the set of parameters that minimizes the distance between the model-implied moments and the data. (In Appendix C.3, I derive analytical formulas for the model-implied moments.) To ensure that Assumption 2 is satisfied, I restrict the parameters space to $\\Theta\\equiv\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{6}\\cap\\{\\theta|0<\\lambda-\\delta<\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\chi,\\bar{\\mu}\\}\\}$ . I target 7 moments related to the dynamics of firm-level productivity and the pace of job reallocation between firms. The moments are: the job creation rate by continuers, the job creation rate by entrants, the job destruction rate by continuers, the job destruction rate by exiters, the unemployment rate, the autocorrelation of firm-level log labor productivity, and the interdecile range of log labor productivity.  \n\nI take the unemployment rate, job creation rate by entrants, and job destruction rate by exiters directly from publicly available data (Statistics Canada Tables 282-0087 and 527- 0001) and compute 2000-2015 averages. The job creation rate by entrant is defined as the sum of all jobs created by entering firms in a year divided by the total number jobs in the economy at the beginning of the year. The job destruction rate by exiters is defined as the number of jobs destroyed by exiting firms divided by the number of total jobs in the economy.  \n\nThe reason why I do not use the NALMF microdata to estimate the job creation rate (destruction rate) by entrants (exiters) is because my main sample is not exactly the universe of firms due to sample restrictions. Therefore, firms moving in and out of the sample does not correspond to firm entry and exit. Moreover, it is not possible to accurately distinguish entry and exits from mergers and acquisitions using only the NALMF data.  \n\nThe remaining moments are computed using the NALMF microdata. The job creation rate by continuers is defined as the sum of jobs created by expanding firms divided by the number of total jobs in the economy. Similarly, the job destruction rate by continuers is defined as the sum of jobs destroyed by shrinking firms divided by the number of total jobs in the economy. The autocorrelation of firm-level log labor productivity is obtained by estimating the autoregressive parameter in a firm-level panel AR(1) regression with year and 3-digit NAICS fixed effects. To compute the interdecile range of log labor productivity, I first remove year and (3-digit NAICS) industry fixed effects from firm-level log labor productivity. I then compute the difference between the 90th and 10th percentiles of the (residualized) log labor productivity in the pooled 2000-2015 sample.  \n\nTABLE III TARGETED MOMENTS.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Moment</td><td>Data</td><td>Model</td></tr><tr><td>Unemployment rate</td><td>0.071</td><td>0.071</td></tr><tr><td>Autocorrelation ofloglaborprod.</td><td>0.810</td><td>0.806</td></tr><tr><td>Interdecile range of log labor prod</td><td>1.547</td><td>1.547</td></tr><tr><td>Jobcreation(continuers)</td><td>0.061</td><td>0.055</td></tr><tr><td>Jobcreation(entrants)</td><td>0.019</td><td>0.022</td></tr><tr><td>Jobdestruction(continuers)</td><td>0.067</td><td>0.062</td></tr><tr><td>Job destruction (exiters)</td><td>0.016</td><td>0.016</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### Numerical Solution  \n\nIn Appendix C.1, I provide a detailed description of the solution method. Denote the vector of moments in the data by $\\hat{\\Lambda}$ . For each value of $\\theta\\in\\Theta$ , I solve the model numerically and compute the model-implied moments $\\Lambda(\\theta)$ . I then choose the parameter $\\theta$ that minimizes the following quadratic form:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{min}_{\\theta\\in\\bar{\\Theta}}\\bigl(\\Lambda(\\theta)-\\hat{\\Lambda}\\bigr)^{\\prime}\\bigl(\\Lambda(\\theta)-\\hat{\\Lambda}\\bigr).\n$$  \n\nSince $\\Theta$ is not compact, I implement the numerical optimization problem by using its closure $\\bar{\\Theta}$ and then verify that the minimizer $\\theta^{*}$ is in O. I obtain the parameter estimate $(\\lambda,\\mu,\\delta,b,\\chi,\\eta)=(0.2443,0.3063,0.0233,0.5981,0.2311,3.8773).$ Table III contains the fit of the model and in Appendix C.3, I report the sensitivity of the targeted moments to changes in parameter values (see paragraph titled “Jacobian matrix\").  \n\nThe only structural parameters that can be interpreted directly are the fow value of unemployment $^b$ and the difference $\\lambda-\\delta$ . The average wage in the economy is 1.0606, so $^b$ is equal to $56\\%$ of the average wage, which is close to (but higher than) the value of 0.4 typically used in the labor search literature. Recall from Lemma 1 that the annual growth rate of employment of a firm is bounded from above by $e^{\\lambda-\\delta}-1\\approx0.25$ The calibration therefore implies that firms cannot grow faster than $25\\%$ annually. Strictly speaking, this is counterfactual given that the empirical firm growth distribution typically contains very high values (Bottazzi and Secchi (2006)). Nevertheless, the constraint imposed by search frictions in the model is not overly restrictive. For example, a firm that remains at the top of the productivity distribution for 25 years will grow its employment by a factor of $e^{2\\hat{5}\\times(\\lambda-\\delta)}\\approx\\hat{2}50$  \n\n### 3.2. Validation  \n\nI now validate the model by assessing its ability to match the data along several dimensions. Given that the calibration strategy does not use data on wages or the labor share, everything from now on is nontargeted.  \n\n#### Aggregate and Average Labor Share  \n\nAs a starting point, consider the empirical counterpart of equation (29),  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}=\\sum_{i}\\omega_{i}\\mathrm{LS}_{i},\n$$  \n\nTABLEIV AGGREGATE LABORSHARE DECOMPOSITION.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Aggregate</td><td>Average</td><td>Covariance</td></tr><tr><td>Data</td><td>0.653</td><td>0.884</td><td>-0.231</td></tr><tr><td>Baseline model</td><td>0.616</td><td>0.889</td><td>-0.273</td></tr><tr><td>Coles-Mortensen</td><td>0.559</td><td>0.547</td><td>+0.011</td></tr><tr><td>Burdett-Mortensen</td><td>0.533</td><td>0.512</td><td>+0.021</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nwhich states that the aggregate labor share is the sum of firm-level labor shares $\\mathbf{L}S_{i}$ weighted by their value-added share $\\omega_{i}$ . Rearranging, the aggregate labor share can be expressed as the sum of the average (unweighted) firm-level labor share and the covariance between labor share and value-added share  \n\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\mathrm{LS}}_{\\mathrm{Aggregate}}=\\underbrace{\\overline{{\\mathrm{LS}}}}_{\\mathrm{Average}}+\\underbrace{\\mathrm{cov}(\\mathrm{LS}_{i},\\omega_{i})}_{\\mathrm{Covariancebetween}}.\n$$  \n\nIn Table IV, I report the three components of equation (33) in the data and in the model. In the data, I compute the components separately in each 2-digit NAICS industry and then take a value-added weighted average. I then compute a simple average over the 2000-2015period.  \n\nThe model generates an aggregate labor share of 0.62, which is close but slightly lower than in the data (0.65). The average (unweighted) firm-level labor share in the model is 0.89, which is also close to the data (0.88). The resulting covariance between labor share and value-added share is negative, and stands at $-0.27$ in the model (-0.23 in the data). Overall, the model replicates the main features of the data: a high average labor share and a negative covariance between value-added and labor share in the cross-section of firms.  \n\nTable IV also contains the same decomposition for the Coles-Mortensen and BurdettMortensen models (see Appendix B for a description of the calibration strategy). Consistent with the theoretical result in the Pareto special case (see Table I), the labor share is lower in the Coles-Mortensen and Burdett-Mortensen economies. Notice that, in both cases, the covariance between value-added share and labor share is close to zero, while it is strongly negative in the data and in the baseline model. As we will see shortly, this is due to the fact that the benchmark models cannot generate labor shares above $1-\\alpha$ (i.e., negative flow profits) for low-productivity firms.  \n\n#### Assessing Cross-Sectional Moments  \n\nThe negative cross-sectional covariance between labor share and value-added share is not only a feature of the Canadian data. It has previously been documented in the case of the Taiwanese manufacturing sector (Edmond, Midrigan, and Xu (2015)), the U.S. manufacturing sector (Kehrig and Vincent (2021)), and most other sectors of the U.S. economy (Autor et al. (2020)). The value-added share of a firm is high either because it is large (it employs a lot of workers) or because it it has a high labor productivity (it produces a lot of value-added per worker). A key prediction of the model is that the negative relationship between value-added and labor share is entirely driven by productivity, not size (see Proposition 2). I now confront this prediction with the data.  \n\nTABLEV ASSESSING CROSS-SECTIONAL MOMENTS.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">(1)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(2)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(3)</td></tr><tr><td>Data</td><td>Model</td><td>Data</td><td>Model</td><td>Data</td><td>Model</td></tr><tr><td>Labor productivity (log y)</td><td>-0.313</td><td>-0.620</td><td>-0.313</td><td>-0.620</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Employment (log N)</td><td>(0.002)</td><td></td><td>(0.002) 0.009</td><td>0</td><td>-0.001</td><td>-0.007</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.001)</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.001)</td></tr><tr><td>Industryfixed effects Yearfixedeffects</td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td>Samplesize</td><td colspan=\"2\">3,084,182</td><td colspan=\"2\">3,084,182</td><td colspan=\"2\">3,084,182</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.272</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.273</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.036</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the firm-level.  \n\nTable $\\mathrm{v}$ contains results from a panel regression of firm-level labor shares on different covariates (all variables are in logarithm) with year and 3-digit NAICS industry fixed effects. Specification (1) regresses labor share on labor productivity. I obtain a negative coefficient of $-0.31$ . As a point of comparison, I compute the (population) regression coefficient in the calibrated model and obtain a value of $-0.62$ . One concern with the regression specification is that the presence of measurement error in value-added could lead to a spurious negative relationship between labor share and labor productivity.13 In Appendix E.1, I address this concern by instrumenting labor productivity with its 1-year lag. I obtain a slightly lower value in absolute terms $(-0.25)$  \n\nSpecification (2) regresses firm-level labor shares on both labor productivity and size. The coefficient on labor productivity remains mostly unchanged $(-0.31)$ while the coefficient on employment is close to zero $(<0.01)$ . This is roughly in line with the model predictions, where (i) introducing employment as a control does not affect the coefficient on labor productivity and (i) the coefficient on employment is zero. Specification (3) regresses firm-level labor shares on size by itself. The relationship is negative but very Small $(-0.001)$ . In the model, the coefficient is larger in absolute value but also very small $(-0.007)$ . Through the lens model, the relationship between employment and labor share is spurious in the sense that it only reflects the positive correlation between productivity and employment in a stationary equilibrium.  \n\nThe empirical relationship between labor productivity and labor share could in principle be explained by the fact that firms differ in their capital share (i.e., the share of payments to capital in value-added). For example, if a firm purchases a robot to replace some of its workers, then labor productivity will increase (because the number of employees decreases) and the share of payments to capital in value-added will increase (because the stock of capital increases). In Appendix E.1, I estimate Specification (1) controlling for the capital-output ratio and find a negligible role for (within-industry) capital intensity heterogeneity in explaining differences in firm labor shares across firms.  \n\nOverall, I find robust support for the idea that high-productivity firms have a lower labor share. In the model, productivity and wages have a rank correlation of one (i.e., high-wage firms are necessarily high-productivity firms). Hence, one would expect that the relationship between average wage (i.e., compensation per worker) and labor share be positive. When I estimate this cross-sectional relationship in the data, I instead obtain a weak positive relationship. In Appendix E.2, I use an accounting decomposition to understand why the model fails to match this particular moment. In short, the reason is that the model does not generate enough wage dispersion between firms.  \n\n#### Unpacking the Aggregate Labor Share  \n\nI now assess whether the model-implied relationship between labor productivity, valueadded share, and labor share is quantitatively consistent with the microdata. Denote by $\\mathrm{L}S_{d}$ and $\\omega_{d}$ the labor share and value-added share within a labor productivity decile $d$ The aggregate labor share can be expressed as  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{LS}=\\sum\\omega_{d}\\mathrm{LS}_{d}.\n$$  \n\nI construct the labor productivity deciles in the data by sorting firm-year observations by labor productivity within industry-year bins. I then pool industries and years together and compute the measure of interest within each decile (see Appendix D.3 for details).  \n\nThe left panel of Figure 2 contains the labor share by labor productivity deciles in the model and in the data. First, notice that there are large differences in the labor share across firms. In the model, the difference between the labor share at the top decile versus the bottom decile is 1.22 (1.14 in the data). To provide a benchmark, I include a horizontal line at $1-\\alpha$ , which corresponds to the labor share that would prevail in a frictionless competitive model. Notice that a large fraction of firms have a high labor share. In the model and in the data, the bottom 5 deciles of firms have a labor share above $1-\\alpha$ In contrast, the top decile of firms have a low labor share of 0.52 (0.44 in the data). In line with the predictions of the baseline model (see Proposition 4), labor shares above $1-\\alpha$ are a pervasive feature of the data. The Burdett-Mortensen and Coles-Mortensen models instead predict that all firms have a labor share strictly below $1-\\alpha$ (see Appendix Figure E.1d).  \n\nBoth in the model and in the data, value-added is extremely concentrated within highproductivity firms (see right panel of Figure 2). In the model, the top decile of firms accountfor $55\\%$ of of value-added ( $42\\%$ in the data), while the bottom 5 deciles accounts for amere $11\\%$ $18\\%$ in the data). Through the lens of the model, the negative covariance between labor share and value-added share documented earlier can thus be explained by the fact that labor shares are decreasing in firm productivity while value-added shares are (on average) increasing in firm productivity.  \n\n![](images/7d61a4c8559c9deb3dc5a6df53c55d504f4291cb1c08f8a0641e5ef3145e95b1.jpg)  \nFIGURE 2.—-Aggregate labor share decomposition.  \n\nIn Appendix E.3, I conduct a number of robustness checks to assess the importance of industries, firm size, capital share heterogeneity, and measurement error in value-added. Overall, I find that the main findings are robust: (i) there is a strong negative relationship between firm-level labor share and labor productivity and (ii) a large fraction of firms have a labor share above $1-\\alpha$  \n\n#### Assessing Panel Moments  \n\nI now assess the ability of the model to match panel moments (i.e., the comovement of variables within firms over time). I focus on two core predictions of the model: (i) firms respond to an increase in productivity by increasing their wage (see Proposition 2), which (ii) induces an increase in their employment growth (see Lemma 1).  \n\nTo compare model and data, I use the following auxiliary models:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log w_{i,t+k}=\\mu_{i}^{k}+\\lambda_{t}^{k}+\\beta_{w}^{k}\\log y_{i,t}+u_{i,t+k},}\\ &{\\Delta^{k}\\log N_{i,t}=\\mu_{i}^{k}+\\lambda_{t}^{k}+\\beta_{g}^{s}\\log w_{i,t}+u_{i,t+k}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe parameters $\\mu_{i}$ and $\\lambda_{t}$ denote firm and year fixed effects. The variables $y_{i,t},w_{i,t} $ and $\\Delta^{k}\\log N_{i,t}$ denote, respectively, labor productivity, average wage, and $k$ -year ahead log employment growth for firm $i$ in year $t$ . The coefficient $\\Bar{\\beta_{w}^{k}}$ represents the response of wages at time $t+k$ to an increase of labor productivity at time $t.$ .Similarly, ${\\beta}_{g}^{k}$ is the response of employment growth between $t$ and $t+k$ to a wage increases at time $t$  \n\nFigure 3a plots the dynamic response of wages to an increase in labor productivity over a 5-year horizon, both in the model and in the data.14 In the data, I do not observe worker-level wages, so I construct a measure of the average wage of a firm by dividing total worker compensation by employment. On impact, wages increase less than one-forone with labor productivity ( $\\beta_{w}^{0}=0.40$ in the model and $\\beta_{w}^{0}=0.57$ in the data). The interpretation is that, on average, workers capture roughly half of productivity increases through higher wages. After 4 years, wages have fully reverted back to zero both in the model and in the data, reflecting the fact that productivity shocks are mean-reverting.  \n\n![](images/10bce72c7b990e1b08c014917b9e8b0be2ddb5e6fc9d2c07925599b564814bfa.jpg)  \nFIGURE 3.—Assessing panel moments (coefficients from specifications (35) and (36)).  \n\nFigure 3b plots the dynamic response of cumulative employment growth to an increase in wages. Both in the model and in the data, cumulative employment growth increases strongly over the first 2 years and then stabilizes. At the one-year horizon, the interpretation is that when a firm increases its wage by $10\\%$ , its annual growth rate of employment increases by 3.7 percentage points in the model and 1.9 in the data. The model thus overpredicts the employment response to a wage increase. Taken at face value, this divergence between model and data means that the model does not generate enough monopsony power. To see that, notice that the first-order condition for wages (14) implies that $1=\\dot{v}(z)\\widetilde{g}^{\\prime}(w)$ . Therefore, a high response of employment growth to a wage change $\\widetilde{g}^{\\prime}(w)$ must coexist with a low present value of rents accruing to firms $v(z)$ (i.e., a low level of monopsony power).  \n\nThe relationship between labor productivity and wages that I estimate is related to existing empirical evidence on the wage-productivity pass-through. The empirical literature consistently finds pass-through elasticities that are positive and well below one (see Card, Cardoso, Heining, and Kline (2018) for a literature review). Similarly, my estimates of the response of employment growth to wages is related to the literature studying separation elasticities (see Manning (2011) for a literature review).15  \n\nIt is worth noting that my dynamic estimates correspond to correlations in the data and do not necessarily have a causal interpretation. To address this, I confront the model with existing causal evidence. Kline, Petkova, Williams, and Zidar (2019) is the most relevant study since it estimates both the elasticity of labor productivity to wages (passthrough elasticity) and the elasticity of worker separations to wages (separation elasticity) in the cross-section of U.s. firms. The identification strategy is based on comparing firms whose patent applications were initially allowed to those whose applications were initially rejected. They find that firms respond to rising productivity by increasing worker compensation, which induces a decline in worker separations. In Table VI, I  \n\nTABLEVI MODEL PREDICTIONS AND EVIDENCE FROM KLINE ET AL. (2019).   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Statistic</td><td>Data</td><td>Model</td></tr><tr><td>Pass-through elasticity</td><td>0.47</td><td>0.54</td></tr><tr><td>Separationelasticity</td><td>-1.62</td><td>-1.49</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNote: The pass-through elasticity is obtained from Column 2 of Table VIl1. It is defined as the percentage change in wage bill per workerinresponsetoa $1\\%$ change in value-added per worker. The separation elasticity is obtained from Column 1 of Table IX. It is defined as the percentage change in the fraction of workers who separate during the next year in response to a $1\\%$ changeinthewage. In Appendix C.3, I provide expressions for the analogous model-implied moments.  \n\nreplicate the estimates from Kline et al. (2019) in the model. The model matches both moments closely: the pass-through elasticity in the model is slightly higher (0.54 versus 0.47) and the separation elasticity is slighly lower in absolute value (-1.49 versus $-1.62)$  \n\n#### Wage Distribution  \n\nOne of the key predictions of wage-posting models is that wage dispersion can be sustained in equilibrium (i.e., the law of one price does not hold). As a final validation exercise, I compare the wage distribution in the model and in the data. I use data from Bowlus, Gouin-Bonenfant, Liu, Lochner, and Park (2021) on the distribution of annual earnings in Canada over the 2000-2015 period and compare it with the distribution of wages across workers in the calibrated model.  \n\nThe variance of log wages is 0.73 in the data, while it is only 0.15 in the model (see Table VIl). Most noticeably, the model can not explain the amount of right-tail inequality in the data: the P99-P90 percentile difference is 1.32 in the data, while it is only 0.34 in the model. Since the model does not include worker heterogeneity, this is not surprising. Following the work of Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999)—who use two-way fixed effect regressions (i.e., AKM regression) to decompose earnings inequality across workers researchers have found that “worker fixed effects” are the key determinant of earnings inequality.  \n\nBoth in the US and in Canada, recent studies employing an AKM framework have found that firms account for roughly $10\\%$ of the variance of log earnings (see Song, Price, Guvenen, Bloom, and Von Wachter (2019) for the U.S. and Dostie, Li, Card, and Parent (2020) for Canada). According to this measure, the model fits the data much more closely: the variance of log wages attributable to firms is 0.15 in the model versus 0.07 in the data.16 Finally, Table VII reports the firm-size wage premium in the model and in the data. As in the data, the model predicts a small premium: firms with $10\\%$ more employees pay wages that are on average $0.1\\%$ higher $0.3\\%$ higher in the data).  \n\nTABLE VII WAGE DISTRIBUTION.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Statistic</td><td>Data</td><td>Model</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Logwage distribution</td></tr><tr><td>Totalvariance</td><td>0.73</td><td>0.15</td></tr><tr><td>P99-P90</td><td>1.32</td><td>0.34</td></tr><tr><td>P90-P50</td><td>0.78</td><td>0.71</td></tr><tr><td>P50-P10</td><td>0.75</td><td>0.29</td></tr><tr><td>Varianceoffirmfixedeffects</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.15</td></tr><tr><td>Firm-size wage premium</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.01</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Data on the wage distribution is obtained from Bowlus et al.

In both cases, I compute the interdecile range of (log) sales per worker net of 2-digit NAICS and year fixed effects, excluding industries 11, 21, 61, and 62.  \n\n## 4. PRODUCTIVITY DISPERSION AND THE LABOR SHARE  \n\nI now use the calibrated model to simulate the effect of a rise in productivity dispersion  \n\nMotivating Evidence. To motivate the exercise, I first present data on productivity dispersion and the labor share in Canada and the U.S. over the the 2000-2015 period (see Table VIIl). For comparability, I use publicly available data on the labor share from Statistics Canada and the BEA. In both countries, I compute productivity dispersion as in Section 3.1, but using sales per worker as a proxy for labor productivity.17 I use Compustat data for the U.S. and the NALMF for Canada. In Appendix D.4, I validate my estimate of productivity dispersion for the U.S. against Census microdata from Barth et al. (2016).  \n\nOne striking observation is that over the 2000-2015 period, the labor share has declined by nearly 6 percentage point in the U.S. while it has remained essentially unchanged in Canada. The mirror image is true for productivity dispersion: the interdecile range of sales per worker has increased by $23~\\mathrm{log}$ points in the U.S. but by only 1 log point in Canada.  \n\n### 4.1. Model Experiment  \n\nI now use the model to simulate the effect of a rise in productivity dispersion of the same magnitude as what the U.S. economy as experienced over the 2000-2015 period. To do so, I lower the parameter $\\eta$ from 3.8773 to 2.9974, which implies a rise in the interdecile range of labor productivity increases by $23~\\mathrm{log}$ points. All other parameters remain unchanged.  \n\nThe model experiment consists of comparing the stationary equilibrium of the model before and after the shock. Table IX summarizes the effect of this “productivity dispersion shock.\" First, the aggregate labor share declines by 1.3 percentage points. To put into perspective, a permanent $1.3\\%$ decline in the labor share is quite large, representing roughly a quarter of the $5.8\\%$ decline of the U.S. labor share reported in Table VII1. In my framework, the capital-output ratio would need to rise by $6.3\\%$ in order to generate such a decline of the labor share.18 Interestingly, the average (unweighted) labor share moves in the opposite direction, increasing by $7.5\\%$ . The capital share remains unchanged, so the decline of the labor share is exactly compensated by a rise of the profit share. The rising wedge between average and aggregate labor share implies that the covariance between labor share and value-added share increases (in absolute value).  \n\nTABLEIX RESPONSE OF AGGREGATES (MODEL EXPERIMENT).   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Steady-state</td><td>Counterfactual</td><td>Change (pp.)</td></tr><tr><td>Laborshare</td><td>0.616</td><td>0.603</td><td>-1.33</td></tr><tr><td>Average labor share</td><td>0.889</td><td>0.964</td><td>7.50</td></tr><tr><td>Covariance</td><td>-0.273</td><td>-0.361</td><td>-8.83</td></tr><tr><td>Capitalshare</td><td>0.230</td><td>0.230</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Profitshare</td><td>0.154</td><td>0.167</td><td>1.33</td></tr><tr><td>Output</td><td>1.598</td><td>1.714</td><td>7.26</td></tr><tr><td>Unemployment</td><td>0.071</td><td>0.071</td><td>-0.01</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nRecall that the productivity distribution $\\Gamma_{0}(z)$ has a mean normalized to one, so a change in its shape parameter $\\eta$ represents a mean-preserving spread. However, given that employment is concentrated within high-productivity firms, the mean-preserving spread generates an increase in aggregate output of $7.3\\%$ . The unemployment rate remains essentially unchanged, reflecting the fact that the rise in productivity dispersion has little effect on firm entry and exit. (This is consistent with the Jacobian matrix in Appendix Table C.II, which indicates that the only targeted moment that is meaningfully responsive to a change in $\\eta$ is productivity dispersion.)  \n\n#### Adjustment and Reallocation Effects  \n\nTo highlight the forces at play, I now study the impact of the productivity dispersion shock along the productivity distribution. Figure 4 plots the response of labor shares and value-added shares by labor productivity deciles. The positive response of the average (unweighted) labor share reported in Table IX can be explained by the fact that, for all but the top 3 deciles, firm labor shares increase. In contrast, the labor share of high-productivity firms decrease.  \n\n![](images/0431e101ee0a93fb82b907423ae0c71f4e5c5ecded226f5e22bbc1055cfdeb8a.jpg)  \nFIGURE 4.—-Response of labor shares and value-added shares (model experiment).  \n\nThe intuition is that firms in the right tail of the productivity distribution become further apart in terms of productivity, which effectively shields them from wage competition. As a result, they keep a larger share of value-added as profits. On the other end of the spectrum, low productivity firms are now willing to absorb larger losses in order to retain their workers. The reason is that the rising profit margins of high-productivity firms lead to an increase of the option value of retaining workers.  \n\nWhile employment shares remain unchanged (see Proposition 3), the relative productivity of firms at the top of the distribution increases, so their value-added share increases. Figure 4b indicates that the bottom 9 deciles of firms lose value-added shares at the expense of the top decile. Taking stock, the model predicts that most firms see an upward adjustment of their labor share, but that there is a reallocation of value added toward high-productivity firms who have a low labor share.  \n\nTo quantify the relative importance of the adjustment and reallocation components, 1 use a shift-share decomposition as in Baily, Hulten, and Campbell (1992). Using equation (34), the change in the aggregate labor share $\\Delta\\mathbf{L}S$ can be expressed as the sum of three terms:  \n\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\Delta\\mathrm{LS}}_{\\mathrm{Total}~(-1.33\\%)}=\\underbrace{\\sum_{d}\\omega_{d}\\Delta\\mathrm{LS}_{d}}_{\\mathrm{Adjustment}~(+0.03\\%)}+\\underbrace{\\sum_{d}\\Delta\\omega_{d}\\mathrm{LS}_{d}}_{\\mathrm{Reallocation}~(-1.08\\%)}+\\underbrace{\\sum_{d}\\Delta\\omega_{d}\\Delta\\mathrm{LS}_{d}}_{\\mathrm{Directed~reallocation}~(-0.29\\%)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega_{d}$ and $\\mathrm{L}S_{d}$ denote the value-added share and labor share of firms in productivity decile $d$ . The adjustment term measures the effect of changing the labor shares $\\mathrm{LS}_{d}$ while keeping the value-added shares $\\omega_{d}$ constant. It accounts for a small positive increase in the aggregate labor share $(+0.03\\%)$ . The reallocation term measures the effect of changing the value-added shares $\\omega_{d}$ while keeping the labor shares $\\mathrm{L}S_{d}$ constant. The reallocation component is the dominant force pushing the labor share down $(-1.08\\%)$ Finally, Kehrig and Vincent (2021) suggest a “directed reallocation\" interpretation of the third term. It accounts for the comovement of labor shares and value-added shares. Since there is reallocation of value-added toward firms with a declining labor share, the directed reallocation term is negative $\\left(-0.29\\%\\right)$  \n\n#### Related Empirical Evidence  \n\nThe model provides a rich set of predictions regarding the effect of a productivity dispersion shock and many of them can be related to existing empirical studies. First, the decline of the labor share in the model is driven by a reallocation of value-added toward firms with a low (and declining) labor share, and is partially offset by an increase in the labor share of most firms. This is precisely what Kehrig and Vincent (2021) document in the U.S. manufacturing sector. They show that over the 1967-2012 period, the aggregate labor share declined by 4.5 percentage point per decade, while the median labor share increased by 0.7 percentage point per decade. They reconcile this divergence by showing that low-labor-share firms have gained value-added shares over time. Over this same period, Kehrig (2015) documents a secular increase in TFP dispersion in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Similarly, Autor et al. (2020) study all U.S. industries and find that falling labor shares are largely accounted for by reallocation rather than a fall in the (unweighted) average labor share across firms.  \n\nSecond, the model predicts that, in response to a productivity dispersion shock, the concentration of value-added increases while employment concentration remains constant. Consistent with this prediction, Kehrig and Vincent (2021) find that there has been a massive reallocation of value-added shares toward low-labor-share firms, but that there was limited reallocation of employment. At the aggregate level, there has been a secular increase in sales concentration in the U.S. over the past two decades (Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2019)) that has coincided with the decline of the labor share. The negative comovement between labor share and concentration at the industry-level is often interpreted as evidence in favor of rising monopoly power (Barkai (2020), Autor et al. (2020)). In my model, however, a rise in productivity dispersion generates a negative comovement of these two variables despite the fact that concentration has no causal effect on the labor share.  \n\n### 4.2. Supportive Evidence  \n\nThe existing literature highlights the fact that there has been substantial heterogeneity in labor share dynamics across countries (see Gutiérrez and Piton (2020)) and industries (see Autor et al. (2020)). How much of this can be explained by differential trends in productivity dispersion? To answer this question, I now estimate the relationship between labor share and productivity dispersion using cross-industry and cross-country evidence. Specifically, I estimate the following specifications:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{LS}_{j,t}=\\mu_{t}+\\beta{\\sigma}_{j,t}+\\varepsilon_{j,t},}\\ &{\\mathrm{LS}_{j,t}=\\mu_{t}+\\gamma_{j}+\\beta{\\sigma}_{j,t}+\\varepsilon_{j,t},}\\ &{\\Delta^{5}\\mathrm{LS}_{j,t}=\\mu_{t}+\\gamma_{j}+\\beta\\Delta^{5}{\\sigma}_{j,t}+\\varepsilon_{j,t+5},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\sigma$ denotes productivity dispersion (i.e., the interdecile range of log labor productivity), LS denotes the labor share, $\\mu_{t}$ is a year fixed effect, $\\gamma_{j}$ is a unit fixed effect (industry or country depending on the data set used), and $\\Delta^{5}$ denotes a 5-year difference.  \n\nThe first specification (equation (38)) uses cross-sectional variation of levels for identification. The second specification (equation (39)) uses variation in LS and $\\sigma$ Within an industry/country over time for identification. For the last specification (equation (40)), I use non-overlapping 5-year periods to calculate changes, so the identification comes from the low frequency comovement of LS and $\\sigma$ . Barkai (2020) and Autor et al. (2020) both use a version of specification (40) to estimate the effect of concentration on the labor share.  \n\n#### Cross-Industry Evidence  \n\nThe relative stability of productivity dispersion at the aggregate level in Canada hides a lot of heterogeneity at the industry level. I now leverage this cross-industry heterogeneity to estimate the relationship between labor share and productivity dispersion. To do so, I aggregate the NALMF microdata to construct a panel data set covering most 3-digit NAICS industries over the 2000-2015 period (see Appendix D.5 for summary statistics).  \n\nIf the Canadian labor market was perfectly segmented along industry lines (i.e., firms within an industry only compete with each other for workers), then each industry could be treated as a separate labor market, and the model predictions would be directly comparable to the cross-industry evidence. In practice, however, workers often move across industries over their career (see Jarosch, Nimczik, and Sorkin (2019) for empirical evidence from Austria). Nevertheless, one would expect the labor share in an industry to be negatively related to its productivity dispersion as long as the labor market is at least partially segmented along industry lines. (In Appendix B.4, I make this point formally in a simplified version of the baseline model.)  \n\nTABLE X CROSS-INDUSTRY REGRESSIONS.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>LS</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.112 (0.029)</td><td>-0.118 (0.047)</td><td>-0.063 (0.034)</td><td>-0.094 (0.026)</td><td>-0.096 (0.023)</td><td>-0.071 (0.020)</td></tr><tr><td>IHH</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.137 (0.218)</td><td>-0.533 (0.071)</td><td>-0.041 (0.095)</td></tr><tr><td>K/Y</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.029 (0.218)</td><td>-0.022 (0.071)</td><td>-0.026 (0.095)</td></tr><tr><td>YearFE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>√</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Industry FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>√</td></tr><tr><td>N R2</td><td>1104 0.154</td><td>1104 0.736</td><td>207 0.228</td><td>1104 0.188</td><td>1104 0.776</td><td>207 0.331</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Standard errors in (1), (2),(4), and (5) are clustered at the industry level. “LS\" denotes labor share; “ $\\sigma$ denotesproductivity dispersion (i.e., the interdecile range of log labor productivity); “K/Y\" denotes the capital to output ratio. For specifications (3) and (6), the windows are 2000-2005, 2005-2010, and 2010-2015.  \n\nIn line with the model experiment, I find that industries with high (rising) productivity dispersion systematically have a low (declining) labor share. Panels (1), (2), and (3) of Table X regress industry-level labor shares on productivity dispersion using specifications (38), (39), and (40). In all specification, I obtain negative coefficients ranging from $-0.063$ (specification (39)) to $-0.118$ (specification (39)). As a frame of reference, the implied slope in the model experiment is $-0.0133/0.23=-0.058.$ Figures 6a and 6b contain scatter plots summarizing the relationship between labor share and productivity dispersion (in levels and in 10-year changes).  \n\nOther factors such as capital deepening (Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014)) and concentration (Barkai (2020); Autor et al. (2020)) have been show to affect the labor share. To control for these other factors, I reproduce specifications (38), (39), and (40) by adding the capital-output ratio and the HHI (sum of squared firm-level sales shares) as controls (see panels (4), (5), and (6) of Table X). Consistent with existing findings, the coefficients on the HHI and the capital-output ratio are all negative. However, the addition of controls does not materially affect my main findings. If anything, the effect of productivity dispersion becomes more precisely estimated—-that is, lower standard errors and less variation across specifications—and the estimated slopes are closer to the model-implied value of $-0.058$  \n\nI now provide a more stringent evaluation of the model's mechanism. In the model experiment, a rise in productivity dispersion leads to a decline of the aggregate labor share that operates through a reallocation of value-added toward high-productivity firms, as opposed to a broad-based decline of firm-level labor shares. In each industry and year, I sort firms into labor productivity quintiles. For each productivity quintile $q$ ,I estimate the following regression:  \n\n$$\nY_{q,j,t}=\\mu_{t}+\\gamma_{j}+\\beta_{q}\\sigma_{j,t}+\\varepsilon_{q,j,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mu_{t}$ is a year fixed effect and $\\gamma_{j}$ is a 3-digit NAICS industry fixed effect. $Y_{q,j,t}$ represents the variable of interest (labor share or value-added share) in productivity quintile $q$ ， industry $j$ , and year $t$  \n\n![](images/444c17bf33528aaf0407eb69bbc1bbeefd41b91e57404b620a237ff585c5681e.jpg)  \nFIGURE 5.-Response of labor shares and value-added shares (model experiment versus data).  \n\nFigure 5 plots the estimated coefficients with their $95\\%$ confidence intervals (standard errors clustered at the industry level). In panel (a), we can see that the labor share of low-productivity firms increases with productivity dispersion while the opposite is true for high-productivity firms. The coefficients are imprecisely estimated, but for the two top quintiles they are negative and significant at the $5\\%$ level. To compare with the model predictions, Figure 5 contains model-implied slopes, which are computed by dividing the change of the variable of interest (i.e., labor share of value-added share) within a specific productivity quintile by the change in productivity dispersion in the model experiment.  \n\nTurning to the reponse of value-added shares (panel (b) of Figure 5), the coefficient for the top quintile of firms is positive while it is negative or near-zero for all the other quintiles. Only the top quintile is significant at the $5\\%$ level. Taken as a whole, these findings are remarkably consistent with the transmission mechanism in the calibrated model.  \n\n#### Cross-Country Evidence  \n\nFinally, I repeat the exercise using cross-country data. For the cross-country exercise, I use harmonized data on productivity dispersion produced by the OECD.19 The measure of productivity dispersion in the data set is exactly the same as I used for the cross-industry exercise (i.e., the interdecile range of log labor productivity in the cross-section of firms). The measures are computed at the NACE two-digit industry level and then averaged with employment weights to provide, for each country-year, a measure for the manufacturing sector and for nonfinancial services sectors. I merge the productivity dispersion data with publicly-available data on sectoral labor shares.2° I obtain a balanced panel of 7 countries (Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, and New Zealand) and two broad industry groups (manufacturing and nonfinancial services) for the 2001-2011 period. One year of data was missing for France and Japan, so I used linear interpolation.  \n\n![](images/b51cd0ae890c8c05d5b15f8ec28f0bd7505157fd41daed97651dfb298842d62f.jpg)  \nFIGURE 6.—-Productivity dispersion and the labor share across countries and industries.  \n\nFigures 6c and 6d contain scatter plots summarizing the relationship between labor share and productivity dispersion (in levels and in 10-year changes). Consistent with the model predictions, I find that countries with high (rising) productivity dispersion systematically have a low (declining) labor share. In Appendix E.4, I also report the regression results using specifications (38), (39), and (40).  \n\n## 5. EXTENSIONS  \n\nI now consider a number of model extensions in order to assess how sensitive the results of the model experiment in the previous section are to different modeling choices. Overall, I find that the baseline model is somewhat conservative in the sense that most of the model extensions considered imply a larger labor share decline in response to a rise in productivity dispersion. I organize the results in Table XI, which contains the steady-state aggregate labor share across model extensions as well as the changes in output, unemployment rate, and labor share induced by a rise in productivity dispersion (i.e., a 23-log point increase in the interdecile range of labor productivity, exactly as in Section 4).  \n\nTABLEXI MODEL EXPERIMENT: EXTENSIONS AND ROBUSTNESS CHECKS.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Model</td><td>Steady-state</td><td colspan=\"3\">Experiment(% change)</td></tr><tr><td>LS</td><td> Output</td><td> Unemployment</td><td>△LS</td></tr><tr><td>Benchmarkmodels</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Baseline model</td><td>0.616</td><td>+7.26</td><td>-0.01</td><td>-1.33</td></tr><tr><td>Coles-Mortensen</td><td>0.559</td><td>+7.30</td><td>0</td><td>-1.57</td></tr><tr><td>Burdett-Mortensen</td><td>0.533</td><td>+10.2</td><td>0</td><td>-1.97</td></tr><tr><td>Modelextensions</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Baseline+endogenousb</td><td>0.616</td><td>+7.30</td><td>0</td><td>-1.34</td></tr><tr><td>Baseline + endogenous 入</td><td>0.622</td><td>+15.0</td><td>+0.22</td><td>-1.32</td></tr><tr><td>Baseline + endogenous (入, b)</td><td>0.622</td><td>+14.7</td><td>0</td><td>-1.27</td></tr><tr><td>Paretodistribution</td><td>0.387</td><td>+24.7</td><td>-2.78</td><td>-2.20</td></tr><tr><td>Paretodistribution+endogenous b</td><td>0.387</td><td>+25.2</td><td>0</td><td>-2.36</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### 5.1.Benchmark Models  \n\nFirst, I replicate the model experiment using the calibrated Burdett-Mortensen and Coles-Mortensen models described in Appendix B. Consistent with the theoretical results in the Pareto special case with no discounting (see Table I), the change in the labor share induced by an increase in productivity dispersion in the baseline model $(-1.3\\%)$ is smaller in absolute value than in the Coles-Mortensen model $(-1.6\\%)$ , which itself is smaller than in the Burdett-Mortensen model $(-2.0\\%)$  \n\n### 5.2. Endogenous-b Extension  \n\nIn the baseline model, there is small decline of the unemployment rate in response to a rise in productivity dispersion (see Table IX). The reason is that the equilibrium entry threshold $\\underline{{\\boldsymbol{z}}}$ responds to the increased profitability associated with becoming a highlyproductive firm. In contrast, the benchmark models do not have that force (i.e., firm entry is exogenous).  \n\nFor complete comparability with the benchmark models, I now consider an extension of the baseline model where I shut down the equilibrium response of the unemployment rate (henceforth “endogenous- $^b$ extension\"). To do so, I allow the flow value of unemployment $^b$ to depend on all the model parameters $\\theta$ . In particular, I assume that $b(\\theta)$ is such that the equilibrium unemployment rate is always 0.0713 (i.e., the unemployment rate in the steady state of the baseline model).21  \n\nRepeating the model experiment, I find that the response of the labor share in the endogenous- $^{.b}$ extension is essentially the same as in the baseline model (see Table XI). The reason is that the unemployment rate response in the baseline model is negligible $(-0.01$ percentage point). As we will see shortly, shutting down the response of the unemployment rate will be more important in other model extensions.  \n\n### 5.3. Endogenous-入 Extension  \n\nThe balanced matching assumption in the baseline model implies that the rate at which firms meet workers is exogenous. As a result, the only way that firms can increase their hiring rate is by increasing their wage. I now consider a model extension where firms can increase the rate at which they meet workers by posting more vacancies (henceforth \"endogenous- $\\lambda$ extensions\"). In this section, I describe the main equations and discuss the calibration strategy. In Appendix B.3, I provide a complete derivation of the model.  \n\n#### Environment  \n\nFrom now on, I interpret the meeting rate $\\lambda$ in the baseline model as a vacancy rate (i.e., the measure of vacancies per employee). I assume that firms choose $\\lambda$ optimally subject to a convex cost function $c(\\lambda,z)$ . The employment growth function (equation (18) in the baseline model), is now given by  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{g}(\\lambda,w)=\\overbrace{\\underbrace{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{vacancyrate}}\\times\\underbrace{\\widetilde{f}(w)}_{\\mathrm{vacancyyield}}}^{\\mathrm{}}-\\overbrace{\\big(\\Lambda\\big(1-\\widetilde{\\mathcal{Q}}(w)\\big)+\\delta\\big)}^{\\mathrm{}},\n$$  \n\nwhere the “vacancy yield\" is equal to the probability that a job offer is accepted (i.e., $\\widetilde{f}(w)\\equiv u+(1-u)\\widetilde{\\cal P}(w))$ . As in the baseline model, $\\tilde{P}(w)$ denotes the wage distribution across workers. The new object $\\Lambda$ denotes the aggregate vacancy rate and $\\mathbf{\\tilde{Q}}(w)$ denotes the vacancy-weighted wage distribution. The key difference with the baseline model is that firms can increase their hiring rate either through a higher vacancy rate $\\lambda$ , or through a higher wage, which increases the vacancy yield $\\widetilde{f}(\\boldsymbol{w})$  \n\nFor reasons that will become clear shortly, I consider an isoelastic vacancy-posting cost function of the form  \n\n$$\nc(\\lambda,z)=\\frac{\\lambda^{-\\theta}}{1+\\theta}\\frac{v(z)}{1-\\alpha}\\lambda^{1+\\theta}.\n$$  \n\nThe parameters $\\underline{{\\lambda}}$ ， $\\theta>0$ govern, respectively, the level and convexity of the vacancyposting cost function. The scaling factor $\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}$ ensures that the capital share is equal to $1-\\alpha$ for all firms, as in the baseline modei. Notice that the cost function is proportional to the present value of a hire $v(z)$ . The interpretation is that firms with a vacancy rate $\\lambda$ have to pay a flow of real resources equal to a fraction >1+0 of their value as \"vacancy-posting costs.\"  \n\n#### Equilibrium  \n\nAs in the baseline model, wages $w(z)$ are increasing in firm productivity and firm entry and exit is determined by an endogenous threshold $\\underline{{\\boldsymbol{z}}}$ . The following proposition highlights the equilibrium behavior of firms as it relates to hiring.  \n\nPROPOsITION 7: The equilibrium vacancy yield and vacancy rate are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{f(z)=u+(1-u)P(z),}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{\\lambda(z)=\\lambda f(z)^{\\frac{1}{\\theta}}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe equilibrium vacancy yield $f(z)\\equiv{\\tilde{f}}(w(z))$ is increasing in firm productivity $z$ oWing to the fact that wages are increasing in productivity. The vacancy rate $\\lambda(z)$ is also increasing in productivity. The reason is that a high vacancy yield induces high-productivity firms to post more vacancies per worker. Notice that the parameter $\\underline{{\\lambda}}$ governs the level of vacancy-posting while the parameter $\\theta$ determines the sensitivity of the vacancy rate to firm productivity. The baseline model is nested as a special case where deviation from $\\lambda(z)=\\underline{{\\lambda}}$ are infinitely costly (i.e., $\\theta\\rightarrow\\infty$ ), which implies that all firms have the same vacancy rate.  \n\n#### Calibration  \n\nTo calibrate the new parameter $\\theta$ , I use external evidence on firm vacancies from Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2013) (henceforth DFH). Using establishment-level data on vacancies in the US over the 2002-2006 period, DFH shows that high-growth firms have both a higher vacancy rate (i.e., number of vacancies per employee) and a higher vacancy yield (i.e., number of hires per vacancy). However, they estimate that the vacancy yield is much more elastic, with respect to the hiring rate, than the vacancy rate. The following proposition clarifies how I map the DFH evidence to the model.  \n\nPROPOsITION 8: The equilibrium cross-sectional elasticities of the vacancy rate X and vacancyyield $f$ to thehiring rate $h$ aregivenby  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\log\\lambda}{\\mathrm{d}\\log h}}={\\frac{1}{1+\\theta}},\\qquad{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\log f}{\\mathrm{d}\\log h}}={\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}}.\n$$  \n\nConsider two extreme cases. If the vacancy cost function is linear (i.e., $\\theta=0$ ), then differences in hiring rates across firms are entirely due to differences in the vacancy rate (i.e. $\\mathrm{d}\\log\\lambda/\\mathrm{d}\\log h=1)$ . If instead, the cost function is infinitely convex (i.e., $\\theta\\rightarrow+\\infty$ ), then differences in hiring rates across firms are entirely due to differences in the vacancy yield (i.e., $\\mathrm{d}\\log f/\\mathrm{d}\\log h=1)$ . In short, $\\theta$ determines the relative importance of the vacancy rate and the vacancy yield in explaining the heterogeneity in hiring rates across firms.  \n\nDFH estimates a robust log-linear relationship between the vacancy yield and the hiring rate with an elasticity of $\\mathrm{d}\\log f/\\mathrm{d}\\log h=0.82$ (see Figure IX in Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2013)). The choice of the cost function (43) is thus justified ex post by the fact that it generates an exact log-linear relationship between these two variables. The idea of backward engineering the cost function to match the evidence from DFH has previously been used in Gavazza, Mongey, and Violante (2018).  \n\nFor the calbration,I fist set $\\begin{array}{r}{\\theta=\\frac{\\mathrm{{0}}.82}{1-0.82}=4.56}\\end{array}$ and then ialy albrate the model parameters $(\\underline{{\\lambda}},\\theta,\\mu,\\delta,b,\\chi,\\eta)$ by targeting the same 7 moments as in the baseline model. In Appendix C.1, I extend the solution algorithm to account for endogenous vacancyposting and in Appendix C.4, I report the targeted moment fit.  \n\n#### Quantitative Results  \n\nThe aggregate labor share in the endogenous- $\\lambda$ extension is about one percentage point higher than in the baseline model (see Table XI), entirely due to a lower profit share (the capital share is $\\alpha=0.23$ in both models, see Appendix B.3 for a discussion). Moreover, the aggregate labor share responds somewhat more mildly to a productivity dispersion shock than in the baseline model (see Table XI). Shutting down the equilibrium response of the unemployment rate (i.e., row “endogenous- $(\\lambda,b)$ extension\" of Table XI), the response is slightly lower in absolute value.  \n\n![](images/e4fc09681f687d03186f2f677e35c67b42b837c5e4d5e8810d4b46bc7c9e26a8.jpg)  \nFIGURE 7.—-Hiring and wages in the endogenous- $\\lambda$ extension (calibrated model).  \n\nThis finding suggests that the addition of a vacancy-posting margin effectively reduces the amount of monopsony power. A related finding emerges in Manning (2006), who studies a simple model where monopsonistic firms can raise employment either by increasing the wage offered or increasing expenditures on recruiting. The author shows that the convexity of the recruiting cost function is a central determinant of the amount of monopsony profits.  \n\nQuantitatively, I find that moving from $\\theta\\to\\infty$ (in the baseline model) to $\\theta=4.56$ (in the endogenous- $\\cdot\\lambda$ extension), implies only a modest decrease in the profit share of about 1 percentage point. To understand why, it is important to go back to the micro moment that pins down 0. Figure ${7}\\mathbf{a}$ plots the equilibrium hiring rate against the vacancy yield, both in logarithms. While the endogenous- $\\cdot\\lambda$ extension has a slope lower than in the baseline model (0.82 versus 1), the slope is still well above 0, indicating that high-growth firms use the wage margin intensively to increase their hiring. Through the lens of the model, it must mean that the vacancy-posting cost function has a lot of curvature (i.e., $\\theta$ is high).  \n\nFinally, it is worth pointing out that the addition of a vacancy-posting margin has the additional effect of reducing wage dispersion. Figure 7b plots the (relative) wage distribution in the baseline model and in the endogenous- $\\cdot\\lambda$ extension. The distribution becomes visibly less spread out, and the variance of log wages across workers declines from 0.15 to 0.12, putting it more in line with the empirical target of 0.07 (see “variance of firm effects\" in Table VIl).  \n\n### 5.4. Pareto Distribution  \n\nAs a final robustness check, I now consider an alternative calibration strategy where the productivity distribution $\\Gamma_{0}(z)$ is Pareto as assumed in Proposition 6. To ensure that the calibration strategy is fully consistent with the baseline model, I parametrize the Pareto distribution so that its mean is normalized to one. In particular, I assume that  \n\n$$\n\\Gamma(z)=1-(1-\\sigma)^{-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}z^{-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}\\quad\\mathrm{for}z\\geq1-\\sigma,\n$$  \n\nwhere the tail ndex atisies $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sigma<\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}\\end{array}$ toensure fnite agregateoutput seeAumto ).  \n\nI solve the model and calibrate it using the same algorithm as for the baseline model. In Appendix C.4, I report the targeted moment fit. It is worth noting that the Pareto model fails to match the (nontargeted) joint distribution of labor productivity and labor share. In particular, it generates a labor share for firms in the top decile of labor productivity that is much lower than in the data (0.23 versus 0.53, see Appendix Figure E.1e). Relatedly, it implies a low aggregate labor share (0.39 versus 0.62 in the baseline model, see Table XI).  \n\nRepeating the model experiment, I find that the response to the productivity dispersion shock is much stronger than in the baseline model (i.e., $-2.2\\%$ versus $-1.3\\%$ ; see Table Table XI). Shutting down the equilibrium response of the unemployment rate (i.e., row \"Pareto distribution $+$ endogenous- $^b$ extension\" of Table XI), the response is even larger, at $-2.4\\%$  \n\n## 6. CONCLUDING REMARKS  \n\nIn this paper, I study the effect of labor market imperfections on the labor share in a tractable firm dynamics model with search frictions. In the model, heterogeneous firms grow by accumulating workers and compete through wages in a frictional labor market. In equilibrium, high-productivity firms pay wages below the marginal product while lowproductivity firms pay wages above the marginal product. I calibrate the model using administrative data covering the universe of firms in Canada over the 2000-2015 period and show that it can replicate a number of nontargeted features of the data, despite being very parsimonious.  \n\nThe key theoretical finding is that the distribution of firm productivity is a central determinant of the aggregate labor share. I find that productivity dispersion effectively weakens the intensity of wage competition in the labor market. Quantitatively, the model predicts that a rise in productivity dispersion of the same magnitude as what the U.s. economy has experienced over the 2000-2015 period causes a 1.3 percentage point decline in the aggregate labor share. Importantly, the decline of the labor share operates via a reallocation of value-added toward firms with a low (and declining) labor share, thus providing a new interpretation to recent firm-level evidence on the decline of the U.s. labor share (see Autor et al. (2020); Kehrig and Vincent (2021)). Exploiting heterogeneity in labor share trends across countries and industries, I provide regression evidence in support of the idea that countries and industries with high (rising) productivity dispersion systematically have a low (declining) labor share.  \n\nThe analysis in this paper has focused on firm heterogeneity while abstracting from worker heterogeneity. Future work should attempt to quantify which workers benefit the most from working at high-productivity firms. For instance, are “superstar workers\" able to extract their full marginal product when working at “superstar firms\"?  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nABOWD, JOHN M., FRANCIS KRAMARZ, AND DAVID N.

MATALONI JR., DYLAN G. RASSIER, AND KIM J. RUHL\\*  \n\nWe show how offshore profit shifting by US multinational enterprises affects several key measures of theUS economy.Profits shifted out of the United States grew rapidly from the mid-1990s to 2010 and have since waned. From 1982-2016, on average, 38 percent of income attributedtoUsdirectinvestmentabroadisreattributabletothe United States. We find that adjusting for profit shifting shrinks the trade deficit, decreases the return on Us foreign direct investment abroad, boosts productivity growth rates in the late 1990s and early 2000s,and lowers labor's share of income. (JEL E23, E25,F14,F23, H25,H87, L25)  \n\nIn this paper, we study the implications for aggregate measurement of offshore profit shifting by domestic and foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in the United States. Offshore profit shifting (for brevity, “profit shifting\") occurs when an MNE structures itself so that profits that would have accrued in the United States accrue instead in its foreign affiliates. These shifted profits are recorded in the US primary income account as a return on US assets held abroad, which is not counted in US GDP.1 Using firm-level data, we show that profit shifting has reduced US GDP as measured in official statistics. Over the years 1982-2016, we estimate that, on average, 38 percent of income recorded by US MNEs on their foreign direct investment should be reattributed to US GDP. We find that profit shifting is concentrated in industries and firms with significant research and development spending, providing support for the theory that intangible assets facilitate profit shifting.  \n\nProfit shifting was not a significant factor in the US economy until the late 1990s, when both income on US foreign direct investment and profit shifting accelerated. Our estimates of shifted profits peak in 2010 at almost $\\$200$ billion and have since averaged about $\\$150$ billion per year. To explain the contribution of profit shifting to US economic measurement, we begin with two important facts.  \n\nFirst, the total economic activity generated by US MNEs is very large and has grown significantly in the past 20 years. The total global value added of US MNEs was $\\$5.22$ trillion in 2016, making them equivalent to the fourth-largest economy in the world, trailing only the United States, the European Union, and China. In the same year, their domestic value added was $\\$3.92$ trillion, accounting for 27.6 percent of US business-sector value added. Furthermore, in the last 20 years, US MNEs have substantially increased their global operations: earnings on US direct investment abroad averaged 15.2 percent of corporate profits from 1982 to 1993 but grew to 27.3 percent ( $\\$441$ billion) of corporate profits in 2016.2  \n\nSecond, MNEs own significant stocks of intangible capital (e.g., intellectual property, brands, blueprints) and have a presence in countries that vary widely in corporate tax rates. These characteristics allow MNEs to legally take advantage of differences in national tax regimes to shift profits from high-tax jurisdictions—such as the United States—to low-tax jurisdictions, such as Bermuda. Increasingly common profit-shifting practices include transfer pricing and complex global structuring related to intangible capital, in which an MNE effectively underprices intangible capital when “sold” from one of its entities in a high-tax jurisdiction to another of its entities in a low-tax jurisdiction or engages in a series of transactions among subsidiaries that are strategically located in order to reduce the MNE's effective global tax rate.3 For US MNEs, these strategies allow them to book earnings in low-tax foreign affiliates in ways that are disproportionate to the economic activity carried out in those affiliates.4 These tax strategies have generated discussion among both the compilers and users of official statistics regarding the treatment of transactions within MNEs and their effect on national statistics.5  \n\nThe effects of profit shifting on value added can be illustrated through a concrete example. Consider the iPhone, which is developed and designed in California but assembled by an unrelated company in China, with components manufactured in various (mostly Asian) countries. Taking some hypothetical ballpark figures, suppose the bill of materials and labor costs of assembly amount to $\\$250$ per iPhone and the average selling price is $\\$750$ , for a gross profit of $\\$500$ per phone. For simplicity, assume that there are no further costs of retailing and that all iPhones are sold to customers outside of the United States.  \n\nTwo important questions arise from this simple scenario: First, defining GDP as total domestic value added, how much should each iPhone contribute to US GDP? Second, given the profit-shifting practices described above, how much of each iPhone's gross profit is actually included in US GDP?  \n\nTo answer the first question, note that the $\\$250$ paid to contract manufacturers and suppliers in Asia is not part of US GDP, whereas how much of the $\\$500$ gross profit should be attributed to US GDP depends on where that value is created. If consumers are willing to pay a $\\$500$ premium over the production cost for an iPhone, it is because they value the design, software, brand name, and customer service embedded in the product. If we assume these intangibles were developed by managers, engineers, and designers at Apple headquarters in California (Apple, United States), then the entire $\\$500$ should be included in US GDP. In the national accounts, the $\\$500$ would be a net export under “charges for the use of intellectual property” in expenditure-based GDP, matched by an increase in Apple's earnings in income-based GDP. To the extent that some intangible assets were created outside of the United States, only the appropriate share of the gross profit and related net exports would accrue to the United States.  \n\nAs to the second question, the gross profit actually included in US GDP may be small as a result of national accounting conventions. Suppose that Apple generates intangible assets in the United States and legally transfers them to a foreign affiliate (e.g., one in Ireland). Payments for the use of intellectual property will accrue in Ireland rather than in the United States, which means that the returns to Apple United States’ intangible assets are attributed to an Apple affiliate outside the United States and not included in US GDP. In this case, the returns are captured in “income on US direct investment abroad (USDIA),’ which is used, along with foreign direct investment in the United States (FDIUS), to calculate US gross national product (GNP),  \n\n$$\nG N P_{t}=G D P_{t}+{\\mathrm{income~on~USDIA}}_{t}-{\\mathrm{income~on~FDIUS}}_{t}+/-\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot\n$$  \n\nThus, relative to the conceptual measure, US net exports, corporate profits, and GDP are understated and earnings on USDIA are overstated.6  \n\nProfit shifting results in retained profits and other assets accumulating in foreign affiliates, particularly in affiliates located in low-tax jurisdictions (Foley et al. 2007). To illustrate the prevalence of this situation, Table 1 reports, by host country, the total assets (cash, receivables, property, plant, and equipment (PPE), etc.) owned by the foreign affiliates of US MNEs relative to several production-related measures.7 Canada is not considered a low-tax jurisdiction but is an important destination for US foreign direct investment. The other countries in the table are the well-known “\"tax havens\" in Europe, the Caribbean, and Asia. The ratio of total assets to physical capital (PPE) for US-owned foreign affiliates in Canada is 6.4, whereas this ratio averages almost 300 for European tax havens Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and more than 90 for Barbados, Bermuda, and the United Kingdom Islands, Caribbean. Measuring assets relative to employment (number of employees) or compensation yields similar patterns.8  \n\nTABLE 1—ASSETS IN US-OWNED FOREIGN AFFILIATES, 2012   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"3\">Ratio of US-owned foreign affiliate total assets to</td></tr><tr><td>PPE</td><td>Compensation</td><td>Employment (mil.

Total assets are the sum of all financial (e.g., cash, receivables) and nonfinancial (e.g., property, plant, and equipment [PPE], inventories) assets on a historic cost basis-that is, amounts reported on firms’ financial statements under US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). United Kingdom Islands (UKI), Caribbean, consist of the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Turks and Caicos Islands.  \n\nThe goal of this paper is to calculate an alternative measure of US GDP and several key aggregate statistics by adjusting for the effects of MNE profit shifting on value added. For this purpose, we use confidential MNE survey data, collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) for the period 1982-2016 (Bureau of Economic Analysis n.d.).9 The survey data cover the worldwide operations of US MNEs and contain, among other key measures, information on their employment, PPE, and R&D expenditures. We also use annual data for transactions in income on direct investment published by BEA in the International Transactions Accounts, also available for 1982-2016.  \n\nProfit shifting confounds the relationship between the location of economic activity and the location of reported profit. To realign reported profit and economic activity, we use the firm-level data to reattribute earnings on USDIA among a US parent and its foreign affiliates. This reattribution method is derived from a simple model of profit-maximizing firms and implies that the total worldwide earnings of an MNE are attributed to its constituents based on their shares of the MNE's global wage bill, physical capital stock, or stock of intangible capital. It should be noted, however, that our simple method assumes away real factors that can create differences in the returns to productive factors in different locations. Primarily for this reason, our results should be interpreted as estimates rather than exact measurements.  \n\nSince the aggregate earnings of US MNEs are disproportionately booked to low-tax jurisdictions with little real economic activity, our adjustment reattributes their reported earnings toward the United States and other higher-tax jurisdictions, thereby increasing measured US GDP. We use our estimates to compute an adjusted measure of domestic business-sector value added and related statistics for the United States,for 1982-2016.  \n\nFor comparability with earlier work (Fernald 2015), we use domestic business-sector value added as our measure of output. From 1982 to 1999, our adjusted series is never more than 0.6 percent larger than official business-sector value added. Starting in the late 1990s, profit shifting, and the resulting adjustments, grow rapidly. Profit shifting peaks in 2010 resulting in an adjustment that is more than 1.7 percent larger than official business-sector value added. Profit shifting has since ebbed, and our adjustment is about 1 percent larger than official business-sector value added for 2013-2016. Our estimated profit shifting is concentrated into a few sectors that include intangible-intensive industries such as electronics manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and information technology. When we partition our sample by R&D intensity, we find that profit shifting raises value added in these sectors by as much as 6.6 percent in 2008. In the non-R&D intensive firms, profit shifting never increases value added by more than 1 percent.  \n\nOur methodology for estimating profit shifting does not use data on tax rates nor does it make a priori assumptions about “tax haven\" countries. We find, however, that most of the profit shifted out of the United States is shifted to low-tax jurisdictions. For example, 42 percent of the total adjustment in 2016 is derived from the Netherlands and 30 percent is from Bermuda. Ireland, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom Islands, Caribbean round out the list of top profit-shifting destinations. Besides the United States, we find that higher-tax countries such as France, Germany, and Italy receive positive adjustments to their earnings on USDIA reported in official statistics.  \n\nAdjusting for profit shifting affects many aspects of economic measurement. We address four important ones here. First, when we add the shifted profit to corporate income, we need to also make an adjustment to the expenditure accounts. This manifests as an increase in US exports, shrinking the trade deficit, e.g., in 2016, from 2.6 percent of GDP to 1.8 percent. If we assume that profit shifting is only occurring through intangible asset allocation, then our adjustment would leave the existing goods trade deficit unchanged and increase the existing services trade surplus.  \n\nSecond, shifting profits out of foreign affliates decreases the rate of return on USDIA. Our profit-shifting adjustment narrows the gap between the rate of return on USDIA and the rate of return on FDIUS, helping to resolve the investment-income puzzle (Albertus 2019; Gourinchas and Rey 2007). For the period 1982-2016, the average rate of return on USDIA falls from 11.7 percent to 7.3 percent, while the (unadjusted) return on FDIUS is 4.6 percent.10 The adjustment matters more in the later part of our sample. From 2005-2016, the adjusted rate of return on USDIA is 6.9 percent while the (unadjusted) return on FDIUS is 6.2 percent. Our adjustment dramatically decreases the rate of return on foreign direct investment in tax haven countries from 14.2 percent to 1.7 percent and has a smaller effect on the rate of return in non-tax-haven countries, lowering the rate of return from 10.3 percent to 9.6 percent.  \n\nThird, the increase in value added we estimate implies that value added per worker (labor productivity) is affected by profit shifting. The growth in profit shifting during the 2000s is particularly interesting, as it coincides with the slowdown in productivity growth in official statistics (Fernald 2015), which begins in 2004. Our adjustment raises productivity growth from 2004 to 2010 by 13 basis points per year, a modest increase that does not overturn the productivity slowdown. However, this modest effect at the aggregate level masks sizable effects for industries with widespread profit shifting. For example, when we classify four-digit industries based on their R&D intensity (a proxy for intangible capital), the upward revision to productivity growth for R&D-intensive industries between 1999 and 2008 is nine times larger than for non-R&D-intensive industries (and four times larger than the aggregate).  \n\nThe comparison of R&D-intensive and non-R&D-intensive industries reveals another pattern that—while not directly related to the adjustment—is relevant for the broader discussion about productivity growth. R&D-intensive industries have seen much faster productivity growth——a factor of three times more—-than the rest. This is another manifestation of the rising productivity dispersion across firms, and we extend this finding of divergence by two more decades.\"f Finally, the fact that R&D-intensive industries grew at the remarkably fast pace of 4.7 percent per year compared with only 1.5 percent for the rest suggests that the slowdown in aggregate productivity growth was primarily driven by a slowdown in non-R&D-intensive firms.  \n\nFourth, the reattributed income we measure is an increase in domestic corporate profits. This is an increase in capital income, which lowers labor's share of aggregate income. There is significant interest in the recent downward trend in labor's income share (Autor et al. 2020; Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014). In the aggregate, our adjustments imply that the measured labor share falls by 0.9 percentage points more than the labor share in official statistics (1987-2008). The concentration of our adjustment in a few industries implies that the largest differences in labor-share trends occur in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) sectors 33 (including electronics and computers） and 32 (including pharmaceuticals and petroleum). In NAICS sector 33, the adjusted labor share falls by 2.6 percentage points more than in official statistics (1987-2008) and, in NAICS sector 32, the adjusted labor share falls by 3.1 percentage points more (1987-2008).  \n\nFinally, while our focus is on the profit shifting of US MNEs, for some of the same reasons, foreign MNEs may have also shifted profits out of the United States, having a further downward effect on measured US GDP. The BEA surveys cover the US affliates of foreign MNEs but unfortunately do not cover (most of) their foreign operations, including their foreign parent operations. Without this latter piece of data, estimating adjustments for foreign MNEs with the BEA survey data alone is not feasible. It is possible, however, to combine data from commercial databases to make progress on this question, and, in Section V, we construct a dataset of the largest technology-intensive foreign MNEs that have operations in the United States. Our results indicate a similar profit-shifting behavior by these corporations, further affecting measured US GDP and the related measures. In our admittedly incomplete analysis, we find the magnitudes of the effects for foreign MNEs to be smaller than those for US MNEs.  \n\n# RelatedLiterature  \n\nMost of the evidence of MNE profit shifting comes from cross-country regressions of MNE profits (or income) on tax rates. Dharmapala (2014) provides a comprehensive survey. These studies find a strong relationship between differential tax rates and income attribution. In contrast, we do not use tax rate data in our methodology, however, consistent with the previous literature, we find the largest effects of profit shifting in the well-known “tax havens.\" In Section IlIC, we estimate the semi-elasticity of profits to tax rates in ways consistent with the early literature and arrive at very similar results.  \n\nIn the literature that uses microdata to study profit shifting, Clausing (2016) uses aggregate data from the same dataset that we use to estimate profit shifting in US MNEs. Using estimates of the elasticity of MNE income to tax rates, she computes the cross-country distribution of MNE income under the counterfactual that all countries tax profits at 30 percent. The difference between the counterfactual income levels and the observed income levels is attributed to profit shifting. For 2012, she finds profit shifting to be $\\$258$ billion, compared with our estimate of $\\$144$ billion. Clausing (2016) uses her estimates to compute forgone tax revenues, while our focus is on measurement in the real economy.12  \n\nMost similar in approach to our work is Torslov, Wier, and Zucman (2020). Like we do, they use simple relationships derived from profit maximization to estimate aggregate profit shifting. Our data allow us to estimate profit shifted by US multinationals while Torslov, Wier, and Zucman (2020) derive a measure of profit shifting by all of the world's multinationals. In 2015, we estimate US shifted profit to be $\\$157$ billion while they estimate $\\$143$ billion. Using aggregate data, they estimate profit shifting for a large number of countries for 2015, whereas we study only the United States going back to 1982. Our time-series approach puts the 2015 estimates in perspective: our estimated $\\$157$ billion of shifted profit is down more than 17 percent from peak profit shifting in 2010.  \n\nCompared to Torslov, Wier, and Zucman (2020), the microdata we use allow us to provide more detail regarding the industry in which profit shifting takes place and the characteristics of the firms shifting profits. For example, we find that profit shifting is concentrated in firms with significant R&D spending. This evidence provides support for the theory that firms use intangible assets to facilitate profit shifting. Another important benefit of the microdata is that we directly observe which countries US firms are shifting profits in to and out of, whereas Torslov, Wier, and Zucman (2020) allocate shifted profit as being proportional to variables such as service exports. We find their approach and ours to be complementary and the similarity of our aggregate results an important robustness check for both studies.  \n\nAs we discuss in Section I, our method can be interpreted as the formulary apportionment approach that has been primarily applied in multijurisdictional tax practice. The treatment of global income under formulary apportionment is widely explored in multidisciplinary research, and formulary apportionment has been proposed as an alternative to the complexity and subjectivity of transfer pricing for the allocation of international tax obligations within MNEs. 13 We do not, however, view our profit shifting estimates as the outcome of imposing a formulary tax system. Changing taxes (any of them) would generate endogenous responses by firms, which would have to be modeled.  \n\nIn Section I, we present our method for reattributing profits within the firm and how this is reflected in GDP. In Section II we discuss the data. In Section IHI, we present our estimates of profit shifting and discuss their time-series, geographical, and industrial composition. In Section IV, we report the impact of our adjustments on several aspects of economic measurement, and show how our adjustments matter more for R&D-intensive firms and industries. Section V takes a preliminary look at measurement of foreign MNEs operating in the United States and Section VI concludes.  \n\n## 1. Measurement Framework  \n\nThe data on US MNEs from the BEA surveys report, among other variables, profits, compensation, R&D expenditures, PPE, and identifying characteristics such as country and industry of operation. We observe these data for the parent and each affiliate in an MNE. We discuss the details of the dataset in the next section. The issue at hand is that the profits reported in each location do not necessarily reflect the profits earned in that location: unpriced shared resources and profit shifting among entities in the MNE can lead to a disconnect between the two. Our goal is to estimate a measure of the profit earned in each entity of the MNE. We take the difference between the estimated profit and the reported profit to be the profit shifted to or from the entity. We construct our profit measures so that total profit within the MNE remains constant; our procedure reapportions worldwide profit across the members of an MNE.  \n\nOur adjustment is computed for each year. We omit time subscripts for simplicity. Assume that an entity $n$ within an MNE $m$ operates the production function $y_{m n}~=~\\theta_{m n}k_{m n}^{\\alpha_{m n}}\\ell_{m n}^{\\gamma_{m n}}h_{m n}^{1-\\alpha_{m n}-\\gamma_{m n}}$ where $k$ is physical capital, $\\ell$ is labor, $h$ is intangible capital, and $\\theta$ is productivity. We can write the profits earned in an entity as  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{m n}=y_{m n}\\big[p_{m n}-c_{m n}(w_{m n},r_{m n},q_{m n})\\big],\n$$  \n\nwhere $p$ is the price of the entity's output and $c_{m n}(w_{m n},r_{m n},q_{m n})$ is the unit cost function associated with the production function. The variable $w$ is the wage, $r$ is the rental rate of capital, and $q$ is the rental rate of intangible capital. Profit shifting means that prfitsreported in thedata repore ma diffe from T,m. Our goal i to recover $\\pi_{m n}$ from the available data.  \n\nConsider allocating profits using factor payments. We take labor compensation as an example. Profit maximization implies that the profits of an entity can be expressed as  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{m n}=w_{m n}\\ell_{m n}(\\mu_{m n}-1)/\\gamma_{m n},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mu=p/c(r,w,q)$ is the gross markup. If $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$ are identical across entities in the MNE, then we can compute the entity's profits as its share in the global wage bill times the global profits of the MNE,  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{m n}=\\frac{w_{m n}\\ell_{m n}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N_{m}}w_{m k}\\ell_{m k}}\\times\\pi_{m},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\pi_{m}$ is the sum of the profits of all entities in the MNE.14  \n\nWe observe everything on the right-hand side of (4), which allows us to estimate the profit earned in each entity in the MNE, which we denote $\\hat{\\pi}_{m n}$ .When markups and labor shares are identical within the MNE, mn = Tmn  \n\nHow does our estimator behave if there is intra-MNE heterogeneity in markups and labor shares? We can rewrite (4) as a function of the weighted average of all of the markups and labor shares in the MNE,  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\pi}_{m n}=\\pi_{m n}\\bigg(\\frac{\\mu_{m n}-1}{\\gamma_{m n}}\\bigg)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{m}}\\frac{w_{m i}\\ell_{m i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N_{m}}w_{m k}\\ell_{m k}}\\frac{\\mu_{m i}-1}{\\gamma_{m i}}.\n$$  \n\nIfthe entity has a larger markup-labor-share ratio compared with the compensation-weighted average within the MNE, then ${\\hat{\\pi}}_{m n}<\\pi_{m n}$ Note that factor prices and productivity $\\left(\\theta_{m n}\\right)$ do not need to be identical across entities within MNEs, and markups and labor shares do not need to be identical across MNEs.  \n\nExpressions analogous to (4) also hold for physical-capital payments $(r_{m n}k_{m n})$ and intangible-capital payments $\\left(q_{m n}h_{m n}\\right)$ . In theory, each of these approaches should yield the same estimate for profit earned, but measurement error and differences in markups and production technologies across entities will generate different profit estimates. In light of this, we propose a simple weighted average of the three approaches,  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\pi}_{m n}=\\frac{1}{3}\\Bigg[\\frac{w_{m n}\\ell_{m n}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N_{m}}w_{m k}\\ell_{m k}}+\\frac{r_{m n}k_{m n}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N_{m}}r_{m k}k_{m k}}+\\frac{q_{m n}h_{m n}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N_{m}}q_{m k}h_{m k}}\\Bigg]\\times\\pi_{m}.\n$$  \n\nThe average of the three factors is easy to compute and the data are available for almost all of the entities in our dataset. In the multijurisdictional tax literature, this approach is known as formulary apportionment. We adopt this language, referring to compensation and physical- and intangible-capital payments as apportionment factors and Emn =↑mn — Timn as the adjustment for entity $n$ We do not,however, view our measurements as the counterfactual outcome of taxation based on formulary apportionment. Changing to a formulary tax system would generate an endogenous response by MNEs, which we would need to model.  \n\nWe are focused on the adjustment to the US parent of the MNE. We adopt the convention that the parent is the first entity, $n=1,$ The aggregate adjustment to the United States is the sum of the $\\epsilon_{m1}$ over all MNEs. We analyze this aggregate adjustment in Section II and discuss its implications in Section IV.  \n\n### A. National Accounting  \n\nWhen we reattribute profits to the United States, we are decreasing income reported as earned on direct investment abroad. In the national income and product accounts, we need to make a second entry to match the change in income earned on direct investment. How we make this second entry depends on how the MNEs are shifting profits. The three profit shifting methods most often discussed are (i) pricing goods and services sold within the firm so that the high-tax affiliate earns small profits and the low-tax affiliate earns large profits (transfer pricing of goods and services), (ii) pricing intrafirm financial transactions so that high-tax affiliates make large payments to low-tax affiliates (essentially, transfer pricing of loans), and (iii) moving ownership of intangible assets to low-tax affiliates at a price below their true value and charging high-tax affiliates for the use of the intangible assets (essentially, transfer pricing of intangible-asset services).  \n\nOur adjustments are not informative about the profit-shifting methods used—-they will return the same estimated profits under any form of profit shifting. The multinational tax literature, as well as our analysis below, finds convincing evidence that suggests MNEs are using intangible assets to shift profits. Thus, we assume that all profit shifting is carried out through intangible asset transactions. This assumption implies that the profits we reattribute to the United States are for the use of intangible assets, and the additional US profits should be accompanied by an increase in US exports of services.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{GDP^{income}=c o m p e n s a t i o n o f e m p l o y e e s+\\uparrow c o r p o r a t e p r o f i t s+\\cdot\\cdot}.}\\ {\\mathrm{~GDP^{expenditure}=c o n s u m p t i o n+\\uparrow e x p o r t s^{s e r v i c e s}+e x p o r t s^{g o o d s}+/-\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis assumption has no impact on our results, except for our adjustment to the trade balance discussed in Section IVA. Our assumption means that the services trade balance will increase, but the goods trade balance will be unchanged. To the extent that some profit shifting is happening through transfer pricing of goods, the goods trade balance would need to be adjusted, too.  \n\nGiven our assumptions, one dollar of earnings on USDIA reattributed to the parent will increase corporate profits and, thus, income-based GDP, by one dollar. In order to balance the expenditure account, the implication is that “charges for the use of intellectual property” (an export of services) and, thus, expenditure-side GDP, will also increase by one dollar. The current account balance of the balance-of-payments account remains unchanged because the increase in exports offsets the decrease in earnings on USDIA.  \n\n## II. Constructing the Adjustment  \n\nWe focus on domestic business-sector value added from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) published by BEA, which abstracts from the household, government, and nonprofit sectors of the economy. Following (6), we construct adjustments to business-sector value added using annual survey data collected by the BEA on US MNEs. The survey data include financial and operating activities based on income statement and balance sheet information reported under US GAAP for US parents and their foreign affiliates. In accordance with the International Monetary Fund (2009), an enterprise is an affliate of the parent enterprise when the parent owns at least 10 percent of the enterprise's voting stock or equivalent.15 These surveys are required to be completed for all US parents, and surveys are required to be completed for all foreign affiliates based on thresholds for assets, sales, and net income. From these surveys, we use, for each parent and affliate, compensation, net property, plant, and equipment stocks, and stocks of intangible capital, which we use as apportionment factors. The surveys are also our source of earnings reported on US parents and foreign affiliates, as well as the US parent's reported voting interest in a foreign affiliate.  \n\nTo construct adjusted aggregate output, we need the apportionment factors and profits for each entity in each MNE.  \n\n### A.Apportionment Factors  \n\nWe use compensation of employees (wages and salaries plus employer-paid benefits), net PPE stocks, and stocks of intangible capital as apportionment factors. Each factor has advantages and disadvantages.  \n\nCompensation refects both the number of employees and their wages. If workers are paid their value marginal product, then compensation reflects variation in economic activity across industries and countries. Compensation is based on market transactions rather than financial accounting conventions, and, thus, adjustments constructed using only compensation may provide the most objective measure of economic activity. Compensation, however, may not reflect the actual economic owner of intangible capital and may not reflect the provision of services through means such as digital technology, which do not require a physical presence.  \n\nNet PPE stocks represent the net book value of PPE—-based on financial accounting records. It covers structures, machinery, equipment, special tools, deposit containers, whether owned outright or held under a capital lease. It also includes construction-in-progress, capitalized tangible and intangible exploration and development costs and land, timber, mineral rights and similar rights owned. For foreign affiliates, the data are from annual BEA surveys. For US parents, survey data are available only in quinquennial benchmark years. Firm-level parent data for the interim years were generated using linear interpolation and extrapolation.16  \n\nIntangible capital stocks were generated annually at the parent and affiliate level using BEA survey data on R&D expenditures and a perpetual inventory method. The method uses an assumed annual depreciation rate of 26 percent, which is based on an average of depreciation rates that are used for R&D capital stocks in the US Fixed Assets Accounts (Bureau of Economic Analysis 2022a).  \n\nNote that we are using stocks of physical and intangible capital, rather than the payments to these factors as dictated by (3). Our data do not include the rates of return on these assets. If factor returns differ across different entities of an MNE, this will influence our measurement-an issue we avoid when we use compensation of employees.17  \n\n### B. Economic Profits  \n\nThere are several profits measures in the BEA MNE data, each one serving a different purpose. For our research, the most important features are that the measure of profits refects current production and avoids double counting so that we can compute an accurate measure of the worldwide MNE profits to be reapportioned (Blouin and Robinson 2020). Among the BEA profits measures, there are two that reflect current production and avoid double counting: direct investment earnings and profit-type return. We focus on direct investment earnings for three reasons. First, and most important, direct investment earnings is one of the components used to derive GNP from GDP, and the essence of our adjustment is a reallocation of earnings from GNP to GDP. Second, direct investment earnings covers all foreign affiliates whereas profit-type return covers only majority-owned foreign affiliates. Third, direct investment earnings is less likely to be affected by incomplete knowledge or incomplete reporting on BEA surveys of the full scope of the ownership hierarchies within the MNE. By using direct investment earnings, we are reapportioning profits from where they are booked to where they are earned. For a discussion of the various BEA profit measures and their uses, see Clausing (2020).18  \n\nOur measure of profits reflects current production that is consistent with the profits component of GDP calculated by the factor income approach. Profits of US parents are calculated as net income minus capital gains and losses, minus profits of their foreign affiliates on which the US parent has a claim, plus charges for depletion of natural resources. Profits of foreign affiliates on which the US parent has a claim— our measure of foreign profits—are calculated as foreign affiliate net income minus capital gains and losses plus charges for depletion of natural resources, the result of which is multiplied by the parent's direct voting interest in the foreign affiliate. Profits of indirectly held foreign affiliates are included in the equity income of the directly held foreign affiliates so that coverage of the parent's share of foreign affiliate profits is complete. Nevertheless, this method of focusing on directly held foreign affiliates does affect the country-by-country reallocations described in Section IIIB. Foreign profits are reapportioned from the location of their highest aggregation in the foreign affiliate ownership chain (the country by which they are classified in the US international transactions accounts) to where they originated.  \n\n### C. Adjusted Output  \n\nWe compute the entity-level adjustments and aggregate the parents’ adjustments $\\left(\\epsilon_{m1}\\right)$ for all US MNEs. We add this aggregate adjustment to nominal expenditure-based business-sector  value  added  and to nominal  income-based business-sector value added. Let $M$ be the set of all US MNEs and $Y^{\\mathrm{{VA}}}$ be either income- or expenditure-based nominal value added as officially reported. Adjusted value added, $\\hat{\\hat{Y}}^{\\mathrm{vA}}$ is  \n\n$$\n\\hat{Y}^{\\mathrm{vA}}=Y^{\\mathrm{VA}}+\\sum_{m\\in M}\\epsilon_{m1}.\n$$  \n\nWe take the geometric average of the two adjusted value added series and deflate them using the implicit price deflator for business-sector value added.19  \n\n![](images/5402c95fce75cc8f2425ac23999637ff51ea2c4de95cc3986b779d28d7258991.jpg)  \nPanelA.As shareof business-sectorvalue added   \nPanel B.

The Adjustment  \n\nFigure 1 panel A presents the aggregate adjustments as a share of business-sector value added: the sum of the $\\epsilon_{m1}$ from (9) divided by $Y^{\\mathrm{{VA}}}$ . Our baseline adjustment defined in (6) is labeled “weighted adjustment.\" We plot total income on USDIA for reference. In Figure 1 panel B, we plot the adjustment in real dollars.20  \n\nFrom 1982 to 2000, the adjustments grow, but very slowly, and never exceed 0.6 percent of value added in any year. This changes in the early 2000s, as income on USDIA surges, and the weighted adjustments grow to more than 1.7 percent of value added. The cumulative increase in US GDP from the adjustment is substantial. From 2000 to 2016, the weighted adjustment adds $\\$2.05$ trillion to GDP. The adjustments peak in 2010 at $\\$189$ billion and decrease to $\\$140$ billion in 2016.21  \n\nIn Figure 2 panel A, we plot the adjustment when either compensation, physical capital, or intangible capital is the only factor used to compute the apportionment weights, as in (4). From 2000 to 2016, the weighted adjustment adds $\\$2.05$ trillion to GDP. Over the same period, the compensation-based adjustment adds $\\$1.78$ trillion to GDP, the PPE-based adjustment adds $\\$1.47$ trillion, and the intangible-capital-based adjustment adds $\\$2.73$ trillion. The adjustment derived from only intangible capital reflects the fact that MNE R&D spending is largely done by the parent.  \n\nFigure 2 panel B gives a sense of the variability of our adjustment. We compute the weighted adjustment in 100 bootstrapped samples of our data and report the twenty-fifth and seventy-fifth percentile adjustments as dashed lines. The shaded area corresponds to two-standard-deviation bands around the adjustment. Prior to about 2005, the variance around the adjustment is quite small. It increases somewhat after 2008 and the standard deviation in 2016 is $\\$27.2$ billion.  \n\n### A. The Dynamics of Aggregate Profit Shifting  \n\nIn this section, we examine the factors that shaped the evolution of the aggregate adjustment: its rapid growth from the late 1990s to 2010 and its tapering off thereafter.  \n\nTax Laws and Regulations.—The rise in profit shifting in the 1990s spurred enormous research interest in academics (e.g., tax scholars in accounting, economics, and law) as well as in government agencies (e.g., the Department of the Treasury and Congress). The research identifies three changes in tax regulations as important drivers of the rise in profit shifting in the 1990s and its tapering off in the last decade. Here, we briefly summarize the most relevant parts of these tax regulations and provide a more extensive discussion in online AppendixD.  \n\nThe rise in profit shifting coincides with two major changes in tax regulation in the 1990s. The first is the 1995 revision of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations on cost sharing agreements (CSAs). In a CSA, one geographic unit of an MNE— typically a foreign affiliate in a tax haven country-—shares the cost of developing a new technology with its US parent and, in return, is granted rights to royalties on a portion of the sales of products or services using that technology. This change made it much easier for MNEs to use CSAs to transfer their intellectual property at advantageous prices to their foreign affiliates, which then collect the royalties and profits accruing to those intellectual properties.  \n\nThe second change occurred in 1997 when the IRS introduced what would become known as the “check-the-box” regulation, which aimed to simplify how US corporations classified their various subsidiaries. Check-the-box allowed a US MNE to disregard a foreign affiliate by “checking the box” on form 8832. When a disregarded entity received a payment from another entity in the enterprise, the transaction was not taxable, as the payment is viewed as occurring within a consolidated entity. This change made it easier for US MNEs to set up chains of foreign affiliates whose payments to each other were not taxed by the IRS. This arrangement made profit shifting an even more effective tax reduction strategy because a US  \n\nMNE could also shift profits from its foreign subsidiaries in higher-tax jurisdictions to the one(s) in tax havens, without making those transfers a taxable event from the perspective of the IRS.  \n\nThe pivotal role played by CSAs and check-the-box regulation for driving profit shifting was well understood by tax authorities, tax scholars, and MNEs.22 Starting in the mid-2000s, the IRS increased its efforts to reduce the tax base erosion caused by profit shifting and tightened the rules governing CSAs, issuing temporary regulations in 2008 and final regulations in 2011. In testimony to the US Senate in 2013, Harvard law professor Stephen Shay described the pre-2011 regulations as “much more relaxed\" than the post-2011 regulations (Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs 2013). This comment suggests that the combined IRS guidance on “buy-in payments” and “platform contributions” gradually made it more difficult for MNEs to use CSAs to transfer intangible assets. The timing of these tighter new rules (as well as stricter enforcement) lines up very well with the tapering off of profit shifting--and hence in our adjustments.23  \n\nPetroleum.—-As we discuss in more detail below, the oil and gas industry accounts for a large share of our adjustments to US GDP. Given the large swings in oil prices during our sample period, we examine how they have contributed to variation in our adjustments over time.  \n\nCompanies in the petroleum industry often face resource taxes and royalties (in addition to corporate income taxes) that create strong incentives to manage tax liabilities. Perhaps in response to these incentives, the structure of firms in the petroleum industry lends itself to an array of profit shifting strategies. Exploration and production affiliates may be thinly capitalized, and transportation, insurance, hedging operations, and intercompany loans create transfer pricing opportunities. A US multinational petroleum company, for example, agreed in 2017 to pay $\\mathrm{AU}\\S340$ million in extra taxes to the Australian government in regard to intercompany loans that were made at above-market rates (Smyth 2017).  \n\nIn Figure 3 panel A, we plot the price of crude oil, which was relatively stable around $\\$20$ per barrel from about 1986 to 1999 but had a very strong run-up from 2000 to 2014, during which time it quadrupled to $\\$93$ per barrel (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 2022). This rise in oil prices, coupled with the relatively inelastic demand for oil, boosted both domestic and foreign income earned by MNEs in this sector relative to the rest of the US economy. If we assume that the propensity of US MNEs in this sector to shift profits was unchanged, the sector's contribution to the aggregate adjustments will increase along with the rise in oil prices. In Figure 3 panel B, we plot the aggregate adjustments that excludes the petroleum sector (dashed red line) against the baseline adjustment (solid blue line) reproduced from Figure 1. The gap between the two adjustments is small when the price of oil is low and grows large when the price of oil increases, peaking in 2010.  \n\n![](images/08127b42f6bbb3ed7cc3ef4a25cfdec39d818f3f9ec8a99586e08205ed19555e.jpg)  \nPanel A.The price of West Texas   \nPanel B.

In the column DI income, we report the earnings adjustment minus net interest payments as a share of the published USDIA income for the country (Bureau of Economic Analysis 2022h). The United Kingdom Islands (UKI), Caribbean, include the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Turks and Caicos Islands.  \n\n### B. Adjustments for Other Countries  \n\nOur adjustments are reattributions of earnings on USDIA among the parent and foreign affiliates of each US MNE. As evident in Figure 1, in 2016, 32 percent of earnings on USDIA are reattributed to the United States, which we treat as an increase in US GDP. From which countries did these earnings on USDIA originate? The largest reattributions to the United States are concentrated in seven countries, all of which are considered to be low-tax (or high privacy) destinations for MNE profit shifting (Table 2 and Figure 4). Consistent with the popularity of the \"double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\" tax reduction strategy (Sanchirico 2015), the Netherlands is the largest source (42.1 percent) and Ireland is the third-largest  \n\n![](images/bd57f3ebf2fe6a8cad82165110ab963540e313ad7803095392f40fad50fa3b24.jpg)  \nFIGURE 4. GEOGRAPHICAL REATTRIBUTION OF EARNINGS OF US MNES, 2016 (BILLIONS OF US\\$)  \n\nNote: The United Kingdom Islands (UKI), Caribbean, are made up of the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands.   \nMontserrat, and Turks and Caicos Islands.  \n\nSource: The map data are from Natural Earth (2022).  \n\nsource (23.1 percent) of earnings on USDIA reattributed to the United States. The top seven also includes tax havens Bermuda, Luxembourg, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom Islands, Caribbean.  \n\nNote that the earnings on USDIA reattributed away from countries does not mean that the GDP of those countries is overstated because earnings on foreign direct investment and GDP are different measurement concepts. In particular, earnings on foreign direct investment are measured on an immediate-counterparty basis, which means that profits from production at an indirectly held foreign affiliate, such as an affiliate in Germany, are included in the equity income, and thus, earnings on USDIA of a directly held foreign affiliate, such as an affiliate in the Netherlands. In contrast, the profits component of GDP is measured based on where production is presumably taking place, which, in the example, may be either Germany or the United States, as determined under our methodology by the apportionment factors for the parent and affiliates.24  \n\nAs a result, our adjustments are positive for some countries (besides the United States) as well. The seven countries with the largest positive reattribution of earnings on USDIA are listed in Table 2. None of these countries are considered tax havens. Overall, the reattribution pattern supports the concern that profit shifting affects measurement as a result of earnings on USDIA being shifted to affiliates in countries with relatively low tax rates.25  \n\nTABLE 3—SHIFTED PROFITS AND TAX RATES   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>log(unadj. profit) (1)</td><td>log unadj profit adj.profit (2)</td><td>log(adj. profit) (3)</td></tr><tr><td>Taxrate</td><td>-3.21 (0.48)</td><td>-5.15 (1.02)</td><td>0.41 (0.49)</td></tr><tr><td>Labor compensation</td><td>0.44 (0.13)</td><td></td><td>0.34 (0.14)</td></tr><tr><td>Physical capital</td><td>0.41 (0.13)</td><td></td><td>0.64 (0.14)</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>1.99 (0.41)</td><td>2.62 (0.38)</td><td>-1.94 (0.41)</td></tr><tr><td>Adj.R2</td><td>0.92</td><td>0.31</td><td>0.95</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>56</td><td>56</td><td>56</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Standard errors are reported in parentheses.  \n\n### C. Relationship to Tax Rates  \n\nOur apportionment method does not use tax rate differences across countries; our method relies only on measures of economic activity. It is evident, however, that our measures of shifted profits are correlated with tax rate differentials. Much of the literature on profit shifting has looked for evidence of tax-motivated profit shifting by running cross-country regressions of the form  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{log}(\\pi_{i})=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\tau_{i}+\\beta_{2}\\ell_{i}+\\beta_{3}k_{i}+u_{i},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\pi_{i}$ is a measure of reported affiliate profit in country $i,\\tau_{i}$ is a measure of the effective tax rate in country $i$ $\\ell_{i}$ is a measure of labor used by affiliates in country $i$ ， $k_{i}$ is a measure of the physical capital stock used by affliates in country $i,$ and $u_{i}$ is a classical error term. This particular specification is from Hines and Rice (1994), which is estimated using data on the foreign affiliates of US multinationals for 1982, drawn from the same data that we use.  \n\nIn column 1 of Table 3, we report an estimate of (10) using the 1982 data. We find a coefficient (a semi-elasticity) of $-3.21$ comparedto $-2.83$ in Hines and Rice (1994). The different values refect differences in our measure of profits and a slightly different sample of countries. In their model, the theoretical relationship between profits and taxes is  \n\nTABLE 4—ADJUSTMENT BY INDUSTRY OF US PARENT, 2016   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Key industries</td><td colspan=\"2\">Adjustment (percent)</td></tr><tr><td>Share of total adjustment</td><td>Share of industry's value added</td></tr><tr><td>33 Computers, electrical equip., motor vehicles</td><td>36.32</td><td>4.65</td></tr><tr><td>32 Petroleum, chemicals, plastics, wood, paper</td><td>27.01</td><td>5.30</td></tr><tr><td>54 Legal, computer sys. design, scientific R&D</td><td>8.28</td><td>0.83</td></tr><tr><td>51 Publishing, information, data processing</td><td>8.12</td><td>1.17</td></tr><tr><td>52 Finance, insurance</td><td>5.58</td><td>0.53</td></tr><tr><td>31 Food, textiles, apparel</td><td>3.24</td><td>1.55</td></tr><tr><td>21 Mining</td><td>3.22</td><td>2.07</td></tr><tr><td>53 Real estate, leasing</td><td>2.31</td><td>0.13</td></tr><tr><td>80 Other services,except government</td><td>2.10</td><td>0.74</td></tr><tr><td>22 Utilities</td><td>1.94</td><td>0.90</td></tr><tr><td>56 Administrative services</td><td>1.53</td><td>0.38</td></tr><tr><td>42Wholesaletrade</td><td>1.20</td><td>0.15</td></tr><tr><td>48 Transportation, warehousing</td><td>0.93</td><td>0.22</td></tr><tr><td>23 Construction</td><td>0.28</td><td>0.05</td></tr><tr><td>60 Education, health care</td><td>0.13</td><td>-0.01</td></tr><tr><td>44 Retail trade</td><td>-0.29</td><td>-0.04</td></tr><tr><td>11 Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting</td><td>-0.51</td><td>-0.43</td></tr><tr><td>55 Management of companies and enterprises</td><td>-0.56</td><td>-0.22</td></tr><tr><td>70 Arts,entertainment, accommodation</td><td>-0.58</td><td>-0.10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n$$\n\\log(\\pi_{i})\\:=\\:\\log(\\rho_{i})+c_{1}\\tau_{i}+c_{2},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\pi_{i}$ is the reported affiliate profit, $\\rho_{i}$ is the profit derived from real economic activity, and $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are constants. In the model, $\\rho_{i}$ is derived from capital and labor, which leads to the $\\ell_{i}$ and $k_{i}$ terms in (10). In contrast, we have directly computed $\\rho_{i},$ so our theoretically consistent version of (10) is  \n\n$$\n\\log(\\pi_{i})-\\log(\\rho_{i})=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\tau_{i}+u_{i},\n$$  \n\nthe estimates of which we report in the second column of Table 3. We find a semi-elasticity with respect to tax rates of $-5.15$ . We view the similarity of our tax semi-elasticity——derived using no data on tax rates——-to that from specifications that explicitly model profit shifting as a function of the tax rates to be an important consistency check on our results.  \n\nSince we have computed $\\rho_{i}$ directly, we can further study the relationship between tax rates and profit derived from real economic activity. In column 3 in Table 3, weregress $\\rho_{i}$ on tax rates and measures of labor and capital inputs. Once we have removed the shifted profit from the reported profit, the tax rate is no longer significant. Our methodology appears to have removed the tax-motivated profit from the reported profit.  \n\n### D. Industry Composition  \n\nHow is our adjustment distributed across industries? In Table 4, we report the adjustments by two-digit NAICS industry of the US parent in 2016.26 We report an industry's adjustment as its share of the total adjustment and as its share of the industry's unadjusted value added. The industrial composition of the adjustment is consistent with the idea that firms use intangible assets to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions.  \n\nThe industry responsible for the largest contribution to the adjustment is NAICS sector 33, which includes the intellectual-property intensive electronics and computer manufacturing industries. NAICS sector 32—a subset of manufacturing—makes up 27 percent of the total adjustment. This industry is dominated by pharmaceuticals (a part of chemicals) and petroleum, which we have discussed above. (To avoid disclosure of confidential data, we cannot report the exact adjustments for these industries.) The pharmaceutical industry's profits are largely derived from its intellectual property, which provides ample opportunities for profit shifting. A major US pharmaceutical company, for example, has licensed the manufacturing rights to some best-selling drugs to its Irish subsidiary (Bergin and Drawbaugh 2015). NAICS sectors 51 and 54—which include software publishing, data processing and hosting, and computer system design—-make up 16 percent of the aggregate adjustment. As in the pharmaceutical industry, the “information\" industry derives much of its profit from intangible assets and low marginal production costs. NAICS sector 52 is responsible for 5.6 percent of the total adjustment. The foreign operations of the insurance industry, for example, are concentrated in Bermuda—a country whose corporate tax rate is zero.  \n\nThe industries that are not significant contributors to the aggregate adjustment tend to be those in which it is difficult to uncouple the physical location of production from the point of sale. These industries include construction, transportation, education, health care, and other services.  \n\n## IV. The Implications of Profit Shifting  \n\nIn the previous section, we have shown how multinational profit shifting affects the measurement of aggregate output. In this section, we discuss how our adjustments to output feed through to four key trends in the US macroeconomic data. We begin with international variables and conclude with domestic measurement.  \n\n### A.External Balances  \n\nThe income we reattribute to the United States is matched with a flow of exports from the United States to the rest of the world. In the aggregate, the effect of our adjustment on the US trade balance, relative to GDP, can be seen in Figure 5 panel A: The increase in exports makes the trade balance less negative.27 The effect of the adjustment (the gap between the solid and dashed lines in Figure 5 panel A) is small throughout the 1980s and 1990s (less than 0.5 percent of GDP), but then grows rapidly after the turn of the twenty-first century. In 2016, the unadjusted trade balance is $-2.6$ percent of GDP, and the adjusted trade balance is $-1.8$ percent of GDP.  \n\n![](images/339fb7e1495802c6f9a9522d0df39268ed2dd7149bbf27525dd26af0dd95c670.jpg)  \nPanel A.Total tradebalance   \nPanel B. Goods and services trade balances   \nFIGURE 5. TRADE BALANCES  \n\nOur assumption is that the reattributed income is the result of intangible assets created in the United States, so the offsetting exports would be classified as “charges for the use of intellectual property” and counted as a service export from the United States. In Figure 5 panel B, we plot the trade balance for goods and services separately. Our adjustment does not change the goods trade balance, so the only differences between the adjusted and unadjusted goods trade-balance-to-GDP ratios are from changes to GDP in the adjusted measure. Our adjustment makes the services trade balance more positive, and, as before, the effect grows over time and especially rapidly in the 2000s. In 2016, the unadjusted services trade balance is 1.4 percent of GDP, and the adjusted services trade balance is 2.2 percent of GDP.  \n\nThe adjustment to services trade, but not to goods trade, is the only result in which our assumption about the form of profit shifting plays a large role. If we had assumed all profit shifting was done through transfer pricing of intermediate goods between parents and affiliates, we would have only adjusted the goods balance and left the service balance unchanged. In reality, profit shifting occurs through both practices, but our evidence suggests that intangible assets are an important source of profit shifting. Since our approach is not directly informative of the profit shifting method, we make the simplifying assumption that it is all done through intangible assets.  \n\nThe large effects of our adjustment on the trade balance raise a natural question: What is the effect on the current account? As is evident from equation (1), our adjustment decreases income on USDIA and increases exports of services by the same amount, leaving the current account unchanged. In addition, the current account does not change because we assume that interest payments between the parent and affiliates are unaffected by the adjustment. Bruner, Rassier, and Ruhl (2018) consider additional adjustments for interest payments and find a small, negative adjustment to the current account.28  \n\nPanel B. Returns on direct investment by  \n\n![](images/25c446a96e1f638f917a3ac5c2ce896fa8a51b3b6fed32571166781b287bd209.jpg)  \nPanel A.Returns ontotal direct investment  \n\nFIGURE 6. DIRECT INVESTMENT RETURNS  \n\n### B. Foreign Direct Investment Returns  \n\nNet international investment income for the United States is positive, even though the US net international investment position is negative. Gourinchas and Rey (2007) show that this is the result of two factors: US-owned foreign assets are riskier and less liquid than foreign-owned assets in the United States (a composition effect) and a rate of return differential within asset classes. Curcuru, Thomas, and Warnock (2013) argue that the rate of return differential is primarily driven by the rate of return differential on foreign direct investment and Wright and Zucman (2018) argue that foreign direct investment return differentials are explained by the low foreign taxes paid by US MNEs.  \n\nIn the published data, US MNEs have persistently earned higher returns on their foreign direct investment than foreign MNEs earn on their direct investment in the United States (Hausmann and Sturzenegger 2007; McGrattan and Prescott 2010). This can be seen in Figure 6 panel A, in which the unadjusted return on USDIA is greater than the unadjusted return on FDIUS. The return on USDIA is computed as the after-tax income earned on US foreign direct investment abroad divided by the stock of US-owned foreign direct investment, measured at historical cost (Bureau of Economic Analysis 2021f). The return on FDIUS is computed analogously. From 1982 to 2016, the average return on USDIA is 11.7 percent and the average return on FDIUS is 4.6 percent. Starting in 2000, the average difference between the two closed to 1.2 percentage points, down from an average of 4.1 percentage points in 1982-2000.  \n\nSeveral explanations of the return differential have been offered, including unmeasured assets——so-called dark matter—and asymmetries in risk, competition, and the distribution of firm ages. Profit shifting by US MNEs is another possibility. By shifting profits to their foreign affiliates, US MNEs boost the income earned on their foreign assets, and thus, their returns. We compute the adjusted rate of return on USDIA by subtracting our aggregate adjustment from reported income on USDIA and divide the result by the stock of US foreign direct investment abroad.29  \n\nThe adjusted return, plotted in Figure 6 panel A, shifts the return on USDIA down bringing it close to the return on FDIUS. The average return on USDIA falls from 11.7 to 7.3 percent.  \n\nWe can say more about the adjusted total return on USDIA by separating the host countries into tax haven countries and non-havens.30 In Figure 6 panel B, we plot the adjusted and unadjusted returns for the two groups of countries.31 The adjusted return for non-haven countries is lower than the unadjusted return in the early part of the sample and higher than the unadjusted return in the later part of the sample. The rate of return in the haven countries falls significantly: the average return in haven countries falls from 14.2 percent to 1.7 percent.  \n\nRevisiting our earlier comparison of total foreign direct investment returns, it seems reasonable to compare the return on FDIUS (the United States is not a tax haven) to the adjusted return on non-haven countries. The average adjusted return on non-haven countries is 9.6 percent compared to the average return on FDIUS of 4.6 percent. This suggests a more nuanced interpretation of the rate-of-return puzzle. The difference in total returns is largely eliminated by adjusting for profit shifting, but among non-haven countries, the United States continues to earn a premium on its foreign direct investments.  \n\nOur simple adjustment raises many questions: What industries and countries are most affected? How do returns on US MNE domestic assets compare to the adjusted return on USDIA? How do we adjust the stocks of foreign direct investment for profit shifting? Answering these questions requires digging deeper into the data. Further measurement issues arise and stocks of foreign direct investment at disaggregated levels are difficult to construct. We leave these interesting questions to future research.  \n\n### C. Productivity  \n\nA striking feature of the US data is the slowdown in aggregate productivity growth that began in or around 2004.32 Our adjustment increases the growth rate of US GDP between 1998 and 2010. Our adjustment does not change measured labor input, so faster GDP growth will imply faster labor productivity growth.33  \n\nWe follow Fernald (2015) in constructing labor productivity as output per hour worked in the domestic business sector.34 The unadjusted labor productivity growth rate over the entire period averages 2.05 percent per year. This period is often broken into three subperiods that displayed distinct growth patterns: 1982-1994,  \n\nTABLE 5—LABOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH RATES (LOG PERCENT)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Cumulativegrowthrate</td><td colspan=\"2\">Average annual growth rate</td></tr><tr><td>Unadjusted</td><td>Adjusted</td><td>Unadjusted</td><td>Adjusted</td></tr><tr><td>1982-2016</td><td>69.8</td><td>70.2</td><td>2.05</td><td>2.07</td></tr><tr><td>1982-1994</td><td>22.1</td><td>22.0</td><td>1.84</td><td>1.83</td></tr><tr><td>1994-2004</td><td>30.8</td><td>31.3</td><td>3.08</td><td>3.13</td></tr><tr><td>2004-2016</td><td>16.9</td><td>17.0</td><td>1.41</td><td>1.41</td></tr><tr><td>2004-2010</td><td>12.4</td><td>13.1</td><td>2.06</td><td>2.19</td></tr><tr><td>2010-2016</td><td>4.6</td><td>3.9</td><td>0.76</td><td>0.64</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n![](images/471221e6bd40d16fb844a32fe2c403a3dd1c9591dceb69cdd9fab33ff2bce457.jpg)  \nPanel A. Adjusted and unadjusted   \nPanel B. Difference between adjusted and unadjusted   \nFIGURE 7.AGGREGATE CUMULATIVELABORPRODUCTIVITY GROWTH  \n\n1994-2004, and 2004-2016. The unadjusted labor productivity growth rate averaged 1.84 percent per year from 1982 to 1994, 3.08 percent per year from 1994 to 2004, and fell to 1.41 percent per year in the last period (2004-2016). We report cumulative and average annual productivity growth rates in Table 5.  \n\nWe construct adjusted labor productivity by dividing our adjusted measure of business-sector value added (Figure 7 panel B) by the same hours-worked series we used in constructing unadjusted labor productivity. In Figure 7 panel A, we plot the cumulative growth of adjusted and unadjusted labor productivity. Unadjusted aggregate labor productivity grew by 69.8 log percentage points over the period. Our adjustment increases cumulative productivity growth to 70.2 percent. From Figure 7 panel A, it is clear that the adjustment does not affect aggregate productivity in a substantial way until the 1990s, with most of the adjustment occurring after 2000.  \n\nIn Figure 7 panel B, we plot the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted cumulative growth rates for 1990-2016. In the figure, we see that the effect of offshore profit shifting peaked in 2010, at which time it added about 1.1 percentage points to cumulative productivity growth. Post-2010, the adjustment grows more slowly than GDP and the impact on aggregate productivity growth falls. From 2004-2010, the adjustment grew faster than GDP and added 13 basis points to annual productivity growth rates. From 2010 onward, the adjustment grew slower than GDP and lowered annual growth rates by 12 basis points.  \n\nHow does offshore profit shifting affect our understanding of the productivity slowdown? Profit shifting was at work during both the productivity speed up and the slow down, so the answer is not obvious. As reported in Table 5, our adjustment adds five basis points to annual growth rates during the fast-growth period and almost nothing in the slow-growth period. This means that the average annual growth rate of measured productivity falls to about 46 percent of that in the fast-growth period $(1.41/3.08~=~0.46)$ in the unadjusted data and by a bit more $(1.41/3.13=0.45)$ in the adjusted data. In the aggregate, profit shifting makes the measured productivity slowdown a bit worse.  \n\nProductivity and R&D.—Our findings in Section IHID support the idea that intangible assets are an important channel for profit shifting. Attributing the return to intangible capital correctly is likely to make a bigger difference in industries in which intangible capital is more important. To investigate this hypothesis, we construct adjusted productivity measures for industries grouped by their R&D intensities. We take R&D intensity to be a proxy for the importance of intangible assets (e.g., patents, algorithms) in production.35  \n\nWe use the survey data to calculate R&D intensity at the enterprise level—the US parent and all of its foreign affiliates. We calculate R&D intensity by dividing enterprise-level R&D expenditures, aggregated across all available years, by enterprise-level sales to unaffiliated parties, aggregated across all available years. We consider an enterprise to be R&D intensive if its R&D intensity is at or above the seventy-fifth percentile. In most cases, R&D-intensive enterprises include US parents and foreign affiliates classified into industries that are considered to be R&D intensive as defined in Moylan and Robbins (2007).36  \n\nIn Figure 8 panel A, we plot, as a share of unadjusted value added, the adjustments for R&D-intensive and non-R&D-intensive industries. The adjustments for R&Dintensive industries grow rapidly during the 1990s and early 2000s before decreasing, and then rebounding, post-2008. The adjustments for R&D-intensive enterprises as a share of value added are substantially larger than those for non-R&D-intensive enterprises, with the adjustment for R&D-intensive enterprises peaking in 2008 at 6.6 percent of nominal value added. Note that the adjustment is 3.9 times as important in R&D intensive industries as it is in the aggregate (Figure 8 panel A). Profit shifting is concentrated in this group of R&D-intensive firms.  \n\nThe impact of our adjustments on productivity growth by R&D intensity is evident in Figure 8 panel B, in which we plot the difference in cumulative labor productivity growth between the adjusted and unadjusted series (this is the analog of Figure 7 panel B. From 1994 to 2016, adjusting for offshore profit shifting in the R&D-intensive industries adds 2.1 log points to cumulative growth but only $0.21\\mathrm{og}$ points in non-R&D-intensive industries. As we observed in the aggregate data, the largest effects on productivity growth occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s (Table 6).37  \n\n![](images/76f4e266b003d130bc36edd1484a73e2570c472fec1ca4467a4f4ee87d3dc252.jpg)  \nPanel A.

Furthermore, as seen in Figure 9, the productivity gap has widened at an accelerating rate up until the Great Recession, with R&D-intensive industries growing three times faster between 1982 and 1994 and four times faster between 1994 and 2008. Some recent papers have documented rising productivity dispersion across firms in many developed economies since the turn of the twenty-first century, e.g., Decker et al. (2016) for the United States and Andrews, Criscuolo, and Gal (2016) for OECD countries. Figure 9 extends these results by documenting productivity divergence over a longer time horizon that begins in 1982. It also shows that R&D intensity was an important differentiator between industries whose productivity grew rapidly and those that lagged behind. Finally, and more importantly, it shows that the slow growth in US aggregate productivity was primarily due to the sluggish growth of non-R&D-intensive industries—1.7 percent per year between 1982 and 2010—while R&D-intensive industries grew at a remarkably fast pace of 5.6 percent per year.38 This observation suggests that understanding the factors driving the productivity divergence could be key for understanding the slowdown in aggregate productivity observed in many countries. A fuller analysis of these patterns is beyond the scope of this paper, so we leave it for future research.  \n\n![](images/757907beae298a3a00ae721a962ea35aac1269cb54d282b431c18f11a0fcb654.jpg)  \nFIGURE 9. CUMULATIVE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH BY R&D INTENSITY  \n\nFurther Implications for the Measured Slowdown.—Under the accepted dating convention, our adjustments do not affect the aggregate productivity slowdownthe adjustment speeds up growth both before and after 2004. We could, however, also ask, does our adjustment change the timing of the slowdown? A series of papers (e.g., Anzoategui et al. 2019; Garga and Singh 2021) has hypothesized that the productivity slowdown is an endogenous response to the recession that began in 2007. Fernald (2015) and others, however, have argued that the slowdown started before the recession. In Figure 7 panel A, the adjusted productivity series pulls away from the unadjusted series and continues to grow after 2004. Does this push the beginning of the slowdown past 2004?  \n\nIn the online Appendix, we plot the rolling average productivity growth rates for the adjusted and unadjusted data. We do not find strong evidence that the timing of the decline in aggregate productivity growth rates changes after the adjustment: the inflection points of the two series are the same. It is worth noting, however, that the slowdown in the R&D-intensive industries occurred later, in or around 2007. This suggests that the innovation-driven mechanism in Garga and Singh (2021) may be at work, but, again, we do not find strong evidence that the slowdown occurs later in the adjusted data.  \n\nOur adjustments result from profit shifting within MNEs, which is only one source that can affect economic measurement as an explanation for the productivity slowdown. Syverson (2017) starts from the basic quantitative fact that a reversal of the productivity slowdown would have required measured GDP in 2015 to have been 17 percent higher: $\\$3$ trillion. Thus, even a modest fraction of the productivity slowdown explained by measurement would imply hundreds of billions of dollars missing from GDP. While our findings support up to $\\$157$ billion of unmeasured GDP, Syverson (2017) explains four straightforward reasons that would still challenge the measurement hypothesis as a single explanation for the productivity slowdown. Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) quantify a number of possible areas of measurement —-including information technology, intangibles, “free” digital services, and globalization—that may explain some of the productivity slowdown, and they also conclude that the measurement hypothesis cannot be a single explanation for the productivity slowdown.  \n\nWhile our study focuses on output measurement, efforts to improve other core economic statistics that affect productivity measurement, such as price indices, have been launched in response to the Boskin Commission (Boskin et al. 1996), which found a 1.1 percent bias in the consumer price index (CPI). Recent academic studies such as Aghion et al. (2019) explore nuances for quality improvements in price measurement that may have been unknown to the Boskin Commission and conclude that resulting missing productivity growth does not explain the sharp slowdown in growth since 2005. Moulton (2018) summarizes changes made by statistical agencies since the Boskin Commission and finds that the bias in the CPI has been reduced to about 0.85 percent. Moulton (2018) concludes there is no evidence that the overall bias has worsened since 1996. Thus, our results for productivity are consistent with these related studies on economic measurement as an explanation for the productivity slowdown.  \n\n### D. Labor Share of Income  \n\nA well-established empirical regularity during much of the twentieth century is the lack of a time trend in labor's share of aggregate income. This relationship appeared so robust that it became one of Kaldor's balanced growth facts and a key feature that macroeconomic models aimed to match. A number of recent studies, however, find that the labor share has been declining in recent decades—especially since the early 2000s (Autor et al. 2020; Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin 2013; Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014). The decline in the labor share has led to a surge in interest in the measurement of the labor (and capital) share. Our adjustment to GDP has implications for this measurement issue as well. The income we reattribute to the United States is part of domestic capital income (corporate profits), which has the effect of reducing the labor share and raising the capital share.  \n\nTo quantify the magnitude of this effect, in Figure 10 panel A, we plot the unadjusted gross labor share of income for corporate business: employee compensation divided by gross value added.39 We also plot the adjusted gross labor share:  \n\n![](images/a55eb9c6bec20f44af36b3390697f570357d77e5fc05fa46c77a2ca7546ea084.jpg)  \nFIGURE 10. LABOR SHARE IN THE UNITED STATES   \nNotes: “Computers, elec. equip\" is the “computers, electrical equipment, motor vehicles” (NAICS 33) component of manufacturing. “Petroleum, chemicals\" is the “\"petroleum, chemicals, plastics, wood, paper” (NAICS 32) component of manufacturing. Complete definitions of all industry groups are in the online Appendix.  \n\nemployee compensation divided by the sum of gross value added and our aggregate adjustment. As can be anticipated from our previous findings, the adjustment grows over time and accelerates in the 2000s. The unadjusted gross labor share fell from 0.647 in 2001 to 0.573 in 2016, for a decline of 7.5 percentage points, whereas the adjusted labor share fell from 0.641 to 0.565 during the same time, for a decline of 7.5 percentage points. Profit shifting has its largest effect in 2010, where the adjusted labor share is 1.3 percentage points lower than the unadjusted share.40  \n\nThe adjustment in the aggregate labor share of income is driven by a handful of industries. We plot the industry-level labor shares in Figure 10 panel B for the \"computers, electrical equipment, and motor vehicles” grouping and the “petroleum, chemicals, plastics, wood, and paper’ grouping—-these two industries had the largest adjustments in 2016.41 We plot the labor shares for all of our industry groupings in the online Appendix. For 2000-2016, the average labor share in the petroleum group is 2.9 percentage points lower after adjusting for profit shifting with the largest difference between the two series occuring in 2010 at 4.7 percentage points.  \n\nIn the computers group, the average labor share is 2.1 percentage points lower with the largest difference occurring in 2008 at 4.2 percentage points.  \n\n## V. Foreign MNEs in the United States  \n\nAlthough the primary focus of this paper is the apportionment of the worldwide profits of US-owned MNEs, profit shifting by foreign-owned MNEs that operate affiliates in the United States can also affect the measurements studied in the previous section. If foreign-owned MNEs shift profit out of the United States, this will reduce US GDP and income on FDIUS (see (1) for the accounting identity).  \n\nIdeally, we could apply the methodology that we used for US-owned MNEs to foreign-owned MNEs operating in the United States and arrive at a measure of the profit shifting by foreign MNEs. Data availability, however, poses difficulties. Whereas the BEA direct investment surveys cover the worldwide operations of US-owned MNEs, the BEA does not have the legal authority to collect data on the worldwide operations of foreign-owned MNEs that own US affiliates. Creating a dataset comparable to the one we use to study US MNEs requires combining BEA data on the US operations of foreign MNEs with data on the foreign MNEs’ worldwide operations from a commercial dataset such as Bureau van Dijk's Orbis. A particularly challenging aspect of this work is creating a match between companies in the two datasets. A common numeric identifier does not exist in the two datasets, so the linking must be done by name matching, which, because of inconsistencies and ambiguities in company names, is imperfect and time consuming.  \n\nNevertheless, to give a sense of the potential significance of profit shifting by foreign-owned US businesses, we develop a partial link between the BEA and Orbis datasets for 2008, 2012, and 2015. Given our finding that R&D-intensive firms are most affected by profit shifting, we construct a dataset of large technology-intensive, foreign-owned US businesses containing the data needed to conduct an apportionment exercise. These businesses account for about 40 percent of R&D spending by foreign-owned US businesses and 12 percent of employment in all foreign-owned US businesses. The scope of our dataset is summarized in Table 7 and more detail on the construction of the dataset is in the online Appendix.  \n\nIn the dataset we have been able to construct, we find evidence that foreign-owned MNEs operating in the United States are shifting profits out of the United States. In Figure 11, on the vertical axis, we plot the reported US share of worldwide profits for each foreign-owned MNE in our sample. On the horizontal axis, we plot the apportionment weight for the US operations of each foreign-owned MNE.42 In our methodology, if there was no profit shifting, the two measures would fall on the 45-degree line. Since each point underlying the figure is data from an individual foreign-owned MNE operating in the United States, to maintain the confidentiality of the survey data, we cannot show the scatterplot. Instead, we report the locally weighted central tendency of the scatterplot (Lowess smoothed values) and the fitted values from an ordinary least squares regression.  \n\nTABLE 7—PROFIT SHIFTING   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">FDIUS</td><td>USDIA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Numberoffirms</td><td>Shareof R&D spending</td><td>Shareof employment</td><td>Est.shifted profit (bil.)</td><td>Est.shifted profit (bil.)</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>137</td><td>0.45</td><td>0.13</td><td>2.1</td><td>182.2</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>136</td><td>0.43</td><td>0.13</td><td>12.3</td><td>144.0</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>127</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.11</td><td>3.5</td><td>156.5</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: The column labeled “Share of R&D spending” is the share of R&D spending by foreign-owned US businesses, and the column labeled “Share of employment”\" is the share of total US employment in foreign-owned US businesses.  \n\n![](images/8ce5669629059910f0e10d223f734bd4b117e9cd49c1a6c1ee41343bfbf95e2e.jpg)  \nFIGURE 11.FOREIGN-OWNEDMNES OPERATINGIN THEUNITEDSTATES  \n\nIn 2008 (not reported) and 2012, we find the US share of profits is significantly below the 45-degree line—particularly for foreign-owned MNEs with operations concentrated in the United States. The locally weighted central tendency of the scatterplot (Figure 11) suggests that, for foreign-owned businesses with less than 20 percent of their worldwide production attributed to their US operations, their US profits are roughly proportional to their attributed US production. However, the US profits of foreign-owned businesses with 20 percent or more of their worldwide production attributed to the United States are significantly understated relative to their attributed production in the United States.  \n\nIn the 2015 data, we find less evidence of foreign-MNEs shifting profit out of the United States (Figure 11 panel B). In this case, the firms in our sample have US profit shares that are roughly proportional to their production shares. This result is consistent with the increased efforts by revenue authorities in the United States to deter profit shifting, but given the incomplete nature of our data, it is difficult to know the extent to which this result reflects a reduction in profit shifting by foreign MNEs or an artifact of our sample.  \n\nAltogether, if the profits of these foreign-owned businesses were reattributed according to the weighted apportionment factors, their US profits (and US GDP) would havebeen $\\$2.1$ billion higher in 2008, $\\$123$ billion higher in 2012, and $\\$3.5$ billion higher in 2015. It is difficult to judge the magnitude of these figures given the small size of our dataset, but it does suggest that foreign-owned MNEs are shifting profit out of the United States.  \n\nOverall, our analysis, incomplete as it is, suggests that profits of foreign-owned MNEs were being shifted out of the United States. This implies that our findings from the US MNE data (Section II) are likely the lower bounds of profit shifting adjustment.  \n\n## VI. Concluding Remarks  \n\nUsing firm-level data on US MNEs, we find that, on average, 38 percent of income generated from US foreign direct investment abroad is reattributable to US GDP. Adding this shifted profit to value added increases US GDP and decreases the trade deficit, the rate of return on USDIA, and labor's share of income. Profit shifting is concentrated in industries and firms with significant R&D expenditures. In our sample, profit shifting reached its peak in 2010, but remains still a significant issue. In 2016, official domestic business-sector value added in the United States was, on average, more than 1 percentabout $\\$140$ billion—-lower than our adjusted measure.  \n\nWe also examine profit shifting by the US subsidiaries of foreign MNEs. The data used to analyze these companies are not as complete as the BEA survey data that we use for US MNEs, so we are not able to provide a definitive assessment. That said, our preliminary findings—especially Figure 11—suggest a similar pattern. Further work on this topic is warranted.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nAghion, Philippe, Antonin Bergeaud, Timo Boppart, Peter J.
