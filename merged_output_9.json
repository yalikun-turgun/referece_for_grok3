Across 41 countries, institutional ownership is positively associated with E&S performance with additional tests suggesting this relation is causal.  Institutions are motivated by both financial and social returns. Investors increase firms’ E&S performance following shocks that reveal financial benefits to E&S improvements. In cross section, investors increase firms’ E&S performance when they come from countries with a strong community belief in the importance of E&S issues, but not otherwise. As such, these institutional investors transplant their social norms regarding E&S issues around the world.  \n\nJEL classification: G15, G23, G30, M14   \nKeywords: Corporate social responsibility, Institutional investors, Social norms, Culture,   \nEnvironment  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nIn making investment decisions, shareholders today are asked to assess, and can easily track, measures of a firm's financial performance and metrics covering a firm's environmental and social (E&S) performance, which are two components of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Whether E&S performance is beneficial to the average shareholder remains controversial.  \n\nTests that explore the financial costs and benefits of increasing E&S performance yield mixed results. Investments to improve E&S performance could be a signal of agency problems in firms. Outsiders with no financial stake do not bear the costs of such commitments and will press for improvements. If a firm's managers care about these pressures or obtain other private benefits from E&S investments, they will overinvest (Masulis and Reza, 2015; Cheng, Hong. and Shue, 2016; Cronqvist and Yu, 2017). Alternatively, E&S investment can provide valuable product market differentiation and insurance against event risk (Servaes and Tamayo, 2013; Hong and Liskovich, 2016; Albuquerque, Koskinen, and Zhang, 2017; Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo, 2017).  \n\nIn this paper, we take a different tack to shed light on the importance of E&S performance to shareholders. We test for a relation between share ownership and firms’ E&S performance. It is hard to dismiss the hypothesis that E&S investments are beneficial to shareholders if they are a driving force behind firms’ E&S choices.  \n\nWe examine whether shareholders drive E&S performance for firms around the world as pressure for E&S improvement is a truly global phenomenon. We specifically investigate institutional investors because these shareholders own and vote the bulk of the world's equity capital. We construct firm-level environmental and social performance measures using line items (covering areas such as $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, renewable energy use, human rights violations, and employment quality) from several E&S data providers. We also use these providers’ proprietary E&S scores. We combine these measures of firms’ E&S performance with institutional ownership data and financial data to build a sample of 3,277 non-US firms from 41 countries over the 2004-2013 period.  \n\nWe first explore whether institutional investors in aggregate are a driving force behind firms? E&S performance around the world. We test whether lagged total institutional ownership is associated with firms’ E&S performance, controlling for observable factors that can affect E&S performance directly. We find that greater institutional ownership is associated with higher firm- level E&S scores. Not only is this result statistically significant, but it is also economically meaningful. A one standard deviation change in institutional ownership is associated with an increase in our score (data providers proprietary score) for environmental performance of $4.5\\%$ $(6.8\\%)$ and an increase in social performance score of $2.1\\%$ $(8.2\\%)$  \n\nWe next assess whether institutional investors are more impactful in situations in which stronger effects are plausibly expected. Investors that are signatories to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), which commits them to E&S activism, have more than double the average investor impact on firms’ E&S performance. Investors also have a stronger effect in firms with below-median initial E&S scores and, thus, greater scope to improve E&S.  \n\nTo support a causal interpretation, we take advantage of a quasi-natural experiment provided by the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This costly environmental disaster represents an unexpected shock that increased the perceived financial value of having in place robust environmental policies and procedures, particularly for firms in extractive industries. If institutional ownership drives changes in firms’ environmental policies, then firms with greater institutional ownership at the time of the shock are expected to be more reactive in improving environmental performance in the years following this shock. We find precisely this result.  \n\nOther robustness tests support this causal interpretation, including an instrumental variable specification that follows Aggarwal, Erel, Ferreira, and Matos (201l) and Bena, Ferreira, Matos, and Pires (2017) and a firm fixed effect specification that follows Gormley and Matsa (2014). We also assess whether our results are influenced by changes in firms’ governance or transparency levels by controlling for these factors. Our results are unaffected.  \n\nWe next ask what mechanisms investors use to influence firms? E&S performance. Using several additional data sources, as well as tests such as Granger causality, we draw two overall conclusions. First, selecting into good E&S firms or selling bad E&S firms is not a driver of E&S performance change. Instead, investors convey their preferences for improved E&S by engaging with firms they already own. Second, successful engagements are predominantly private, with public pressure such as shareholder proposals used only occasionally to increase leverage in institutions? private negotiations.  \n\nFinally, we conduct tests to understand better the empirical importance of alternative motivations for institutional investors’ push for E&S performance. We introduce a framework that allows for the possibility that in choosing the level of firm E&S performance, institutional investors could be motivated by financial returns or by norms, or a combination of both.  \n\nNorms can be defined as views as to how investment managers and others should or should not behave. If an investment manager lives in a community that believes strongly that firms should have high levels of environmental and social performance, increasing E&S performance in the firms in her portfolio brings the investment manager social rewards and avoids social sanctions. In that setting, the investment manager can drive firms to overinvest in E&S performance in the sense that the level she chooses can exceed the level that maximizes financial returns, which becomes acceptable because it moves firms’ E&S performance closer to her community's E&S ideals.  \n\nTo test whether demands for E&S performance are motivated by financial returns, we exploit the 2008-2009 global financial crisis as recent research shows it to be<a shock that affected, positively, the financial value of the environmental and the social performance levels of firms (Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo, 2017). A financially motivated investor will ask firms for more E&S after its perceived financial value increases. We test this prediction and find that the already significant impact of institutional ownership on firms? E&S performance increases following the financial crisis. This suggests the growing importance of financial motivations behind investors? push for E&S performance.  \n\nTo test whether demands for E&S performance are motivated by a desire to align that performance with an investor's E&S ideals, we exploit differences in these norms across investors. We use multiple sources of data to construct country-level norms regarding environmental and socialissues. These norm measures include outcomes, such as scores on the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), and stated values regarding E&S issues captured by the World Values Survey (WVS). Social norms toward E&S differ significantly across countries and these differences are persistent.  \n\nConsistent with investors being motivated by social returns, foreign institutional investors impact firms’ E&S performance only when these investors are from countries where social norms reveal a greater demand (above median) for E&S performance. Our analysis suggests that a firm's environmental and social performance levels would improve by $7.4\\%$ and $5.2\\%$ respectively, if the firm's foreign investors are from countries with strong instead of weak norms toward E&S performance. In addition, because European countries occupy the top 17 positions in E&S rankings of countries, we conduct tests that group investors by geographic location and find that only European institutional investors impact firms’ E&S performance. Investors do not impact firms′ E&S performance if they come from any other geographic region, including the US.  \n\nA more focused test of the importance of social norms accounts for investor type. Of particular interest are independent institutional investors (e.g., mutual funds) as they face a clear trade-off. They compete for capital and lower performance will affect fund flows, heightening the importance of financial returns. But they are also exposed to social norms as they need to network and raise capital locally and are mindful of local E&S social norms.  \n\nOur tests show that, for independent institutional investors, essentially no impact is evident on firms’ E&S performance if the investor is from a country where E&S social norms are relatively weak, e.g., the US. However, when independent institutional investors come from countries with strong social norms toward E&S issues, e.g., from the Netherlands, they have a significantly positive impact on firms’ E&S performance. Strong enough social norms can overcome market pressures to focus primarily on financial returns. We find that pension plans consistently influence firms to strengthen E&S performance no matter their country of domicile.  \n\nIn conclusion, the social norm tests, combined with the financial crisis tests, show that investors around the world are motivated by both financial and social returns when they address firms'E&S performance.  \n\nIn a final set of tests, we replicate our analysis using US firms. US investors have an insignificant impact on US firms E&S performance. Foreign investors that come from high E&S norm countries have a strong and significant positive impact on US firms, for both their environmental and social performance. Thus, foreign investors’ social norms also make their way into US firms.  \n\nOur paper contributes to the general literature on corporate social responsibility (e.g., Margolis, Elfenbein, and Walsh, 2009; Kitzmueller and Shimshack, 2012; Ferrell, Liang, and Renneboog, 2016). In contrast to papers that focus on firm managers? characteristics and private benefits to explain firms' CSR investments (Masulis and Reza, 2015; Davidson, Dey, and Smith, 2017; Cronqvist and Yu, 2017), we show that investors play a significant role. Similarly, Dimson, Karakas, and Li (2015) detail the private engagements that one socially responsible investor undertakes to change specific E&S policies for US target firms. We complement this research, showing the aggregate impact of global institutional investors on broad measures of firm's E&S performance around the world. We separately study US firms and find that US investors in aggregate play no role in pushing for E&S improvements at US firms.  \n\nOur paper also contributes to the literature that explores institutional investors impact on corporate finance in general (see, e.g, Gillan and Starks, 2000, 2003). Ferreira and Matos (2008) and Aggarwal, Erel, Ferreira, and Matos (2011) show that independent institutional investors, and foreign investors in particular, are more active in improving firms’ governance. Our paper shows that foreign independent institutional investors are consistently active in driving firms to increase E&S performance only if they are from countries with strong E&S social norms.  \n\nViewed broadly, this paper contributes to the literature on the impact of informal rules of the game for finance. We complement papers such as Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2009) that suggest the importance of a society's culture for a range of economic outcomes. We show that institutional investors carry these cultural attributes (in our case, E&S norms) to firms when they invest abroad, transplanting their social norms. Barber, Morse, and Yasuda (2017) study factors that drive limited partner (LP) investor demand for impact funds (these funds have the dual objective of financial and social returns). Tests that segment by geography show that LP investors from Europe dominate the demand for impact funds. This echoes our result that institutional investors from Europe dominate the push to drive firms to higher levels of E&S performance.  \n\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our sample, Section 3 tests whether institutional investors drive firms’ E&S performance, Section 4 explores the mechanisms that investors use, and Section 5 explores why investors ask for E&S performance. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Sample and summary statistics  \n\nIn this section we describe our data sources and provide and discuss descriptive statistics for the sample of firms used in our analysis.  \n\n### 2.1 Data sources  \n\nWe obtain data on firms^ E&S performance from the Thomson Reuters ASSET4 ESG database. Thomson Reuters acquires information from annual reports, corporate sustainability reports, nongovernmental organizations, and news sources for large, publicly traded companies from more than 45 countries, at annual frequency. Thomson Reuters states that reported data items are chosen to maximize company coverage, timeliness of reporting, data availability, quality, and perceived materiality for investors. Consistent coverage of firms begins in 2004, with coverage for a few countries starting in 2009. We use data from the first year of coverage through year-end 2013 for our analysis.  \n\nASSET4 evaluates firms’ environmental commitments in three areas: Emission Reduction, Product Innovation, and Resource Reduction. Social commitments are evaluated in seven areas: Community, Diversity & Opportunity, Employment Quality, Health & Safety, Human Rights, Product Responsibility, and Training & Development. Within each area, ASSET4 analysts identify specific line items (e.g., “Are the firm's greenhouse gas emissions/sales below the industry median in that year?\"), with 148 items in total (see Online Appendix A for details).  \n\nWe construct summary statistics of firms’ E&S performance. There is no obvious right weighting scheme of these line items that an investor should use. We use two weighting approaches for our main tests. First, we transform all line items into indicator variables such that a one corresponds to better environmental or social performance (e.g., a below-median greenhouse gas emission firm would get a one) and construct an equally weighted performance measure, in which we weight all three environmental and all seven social areas equally and then sum across the areas to produce aggregate E&S performance scores. Second, we use the proprietary-weighted aggregate scores that ASSET4 provides to investors (ASSET4 z-scores). These rank-based scores range from 0 to 100 and measure the E&S performance relative to all other companies in a given year. We also use a transparency score produced by ASSET4, defined as the number of data items reported by the company out of all items tracked as part of the ASSET4 scoring system.  \n\nThomson Reuters is one of several providers that measure firms’ E&S performance, with no obvious market leader. We also obtain E&S data from Sustainalytics and Bloomberg that cover publicly traded firms worldwide. Differences arise with respect to which items of E&S choices are considered by each data provider and how they are weighted. Our results are robust to these alternative ways to measure firms’ E&S performance.  \n\nWe measure institutional ownership using the Factset Ownership database. Factset has been widely used (e.g., Ferreira and Matos, 2008; Aggarwal, Erel, Ferreira, and Matos, 2011) and reports institutional investors’ equity holdings collected directly from fund reports, regulatory authorities (e.g., 13F reports), fund associations, and fund management companies themselves. The data also allow us to identify investors by country of domicile and by investor type. Finally, we obtain Worldscope financial statement and stock market valuation data. Our final sample consists of 19,849 firm-year observations and covers 3,277 firms from 41 countries during the period 2004-2013.  \n\n### 2.2 Descriptive statistics  \n\nSignificant variation exists in firms? E&S performance across countries, industries, and time. Table 1 and Fig. 1 provide basic summary statistics. We control for most of these sources of variation with fixed effects.  \n\n# ---INSERT TABLE 1 AND FIGURE 1 NEAR HERE ---  \n\nPanel A of Table 1 shows E&S scores for our entire sample. The mean (median) E score, which weights each sub area equally, is 35.4 (31.8), with a perfect score being 100. The mean (median) S score is 51.7 (51.1). In Panel B, average E&S scores show significant variation across all 41 countries in the sample (we show data for the year 2010 to facilitate comparisons). The countries where firms have the highest E&S performance are all European (France and  \n\nSpain, for example, are ranked in the top three for both E&S). Countries where firms’ E&S scores are lowest are in Asia and Africa.?  \n\nFig. 1 shows E&S performance over time. Because time trends are influenced by sample composition, Panel A shows plots for a constant panel of firms for which data are available in all years between 2004 and 2013 (805 firms), and Panel B plots a larger but shorter constant panel of firms with uninterrupted coverage between 2009 and 2013 (1,662 firms). Firms increase their performance levels of both E and S over the sample period. Institutional ownership rises initially and peaks in 2007, remaining essentially flat afterward. We report in Section 3 that parallel trends between E&S performance and institutional ownership in the early part of our sample do not affect our inferences.  \n\nWe provide more detail on institutional ownership levels across countries in Panel B of Table 1 (again for the year 2010 to facilitate comparisons). The mean level of institutional ownership is $21.4\\%$ , with average levels highest at around $40\\%$ in firms from Canada, Ireland, and Sweden and lowest at below $10\\%$ in Colombian, Chilean, and Malaysian firms. In this global sample, foreign institutions dominate and account for more than two-thirds of all institutional ownership. The sample is unevenly distributed, with $50\\%$ of the observations concentrated in just four countries: Australia, Canada, Japan, and UK.4  \n\n## 3. Do institutional investors drive firms’ environmental and social performance?  \n\nIn this section, we assess whether global evidence shows that institutional investors are a driving force behind firms’ E&S performance. Institutional investors pursuing strategies such as negative or positive screening based on firms’ E&S practices would bias against finding our results. Under positive screening, less scope exists for institutions to improve E&S performance once they become owners, while under negative screening institutions would not even be present to do so. We discuss this further in Section 4.  \n\n### 3.1 Total institutional ownership and firms’ E&S performance  \n\nOur baseline tests examine the relation between (lagged) total institutional ownership and firms’ E&S performance using the specification  \n\n$$\n\\centering L o g\\left(S c o r e_{i t}\\right)=\\alpha+\\beta X_{i t-1}+\\gamma^{\\prime}Y_{i t-1}+\\Lambda+\\varepsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere the dependent variable is the log of one of the environmental or social scores of firm $i$ in year t, $X_{i t-1}$ is the percentage of total institutional ownership in year $t{-}1$ ， $Y_{i t-1}$ are a set of firmlevel control variables in year $t{-}1$ , and $\\Lambda$ are year, country, and industry fixed effects. We use logs of E&S scores to obtain better distributional properties and to reduce the impact of outliers.? For firm-level control variables, we use firm size (log of total assets), asset tangibility, leverage, Tobin's q, and profitability. We include firm size as prior literature has shown it to predict institutional ownership, and larger firms are subject to more external pressures. Hong, Kubik, and Scheinkman (2012) suggest that financial slack also predicts E&S adoption. Following them, we include leverage and asset tangibility to measure credit constraints and Tobin's q and profitability to capture the impact of performance. We include a dummy variable for a firm cross-listed on a major US exchange to proxy for likely higher overall institutional ownership. All right-hand side variables are lagged by one year, and we cluster standard errors by country.7  \n\nWe report the results of these tests in Table 2. In Panel A, which uses the full sample, the positive and significant coefficient on the fraction of a firm's shares owned by institutional investors (Total $I O$ ) in Columns 1 and 3 indicates a positive relation between (lagged) institutional ownership and firms’ E&S performance, each significant at the 1% level. These results are not only statistically significant, but also economically meaningful. To illustrate, a one standard deviation change in total institutional ownership (0.168) is associated with a $4.5\\%$ increase in environmental performance (calculated as $0.168\\times0.268)$ and a $2.1\\%$ increase in social performance (calculated as $0.168\\times0.124_{,}$ . The results are a bit stronger in Columns 2 and 4, which use the proprietary-weighted ASSET4 z-scores. A similar change in institutional ownership is associated with a $6.8\\%$ increase in environmental performance  and an $8.2\\%$ increase in social performance. The consistent results across weighting schemes gives us confidence that the relation between institutional ownership and firms’ E&S performance is not an artifact of the specific aggregation approach we use to calculate overall E&S scores.  \n\n# - INSERT TABLE 2 NEAR HERE ---  \n\nWe next examine two settings in which institutional owners plausibly have a greater impact on firms’ E&S performance within our sample. First, we identify whether an investor becomes a signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment. Being a signatory requires, among other things, that investors incorporate environmental, social, and governance issues into their investment analysis and decision making and that they are active owners, individually and collectively, regarding these goals. We therefore expect a larger impact from UN PRI signatories. At the beginning of our sample period, there were no signatories to the UN PRI. By the end of the sample period, $57\\%$ of our institutional owners are UN PRI signatories.  \n\nSecond, we consider when a firm has greater scope for E&S improvement. To capture this scope, we split our sample into firms with low (below median) and high (equal or above median) E&S performance at the time they enter the sample. We expect greater effects in the firms with low initial E&S performance.  \n\nWe find support for enhanced institutional investor impact in both settings. In Panel B of Table 2, the economic impact of institutional investors is greater when those investors are UN PRI signatories, and this difference in coefficients is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level in all four specifications ( $\\dot{p}$ -values reported in the last row of Panel B). Compared with the Panel A results, the coefficient is almost three times larger for environmental performance and more than two times larger for social performance. To illustrate, increasing UN PRI signatory ownership by 16.8 percentage points (one standard deviation of institutional ownership) predicts a $13.0\\%$ increase in environmental performance and a $4.6\\%$ increase in social performance. Panel C shows that the impact of institutional investors is greater for firms with more, not less, room for E&S improvement and that this difference is always statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. Because these tests confirm greater investor impact on E&S in settings where a greater effect is expected, they increase confidence that the statistical relation identified in Panel A of Table 2 reflects real pressures coming from investors.  \n\n### 3.2 A quasi-natural experiment: the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill  \n\nAs a further test of the hypothesis that institutional investors cause changes in firms’ E&S performance, we use the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill on May 24, 2010 as a quasi-natural experiment. This unexpected event serves as an exogenous shock to the importance that institutional investors  assign to  firms’ environmental  commitments.  While the  immediate negative economic effect of the oil spill was on BP, the event arguably focused investors' attention on all extractive industries and the potential risks of weak environmental policies even in the most developed countries. If institutional ownership drives changes in firms' environmental performance, we expect that firms with greater institutional ownership at the time of  the  Deepwater  Horizon  disaster would  subsequently   display   higher  environmental performance levels, as these institutional owners are better able to force through policy changes.  \n\nFor this test, we follow a difference-in-differences approach using the years 2009-2012 to have balance on each side of the event. To address serial correlation (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan, 2004), we collapse the two-year pre- and post-event periods each into one observation. Further, to ensure that the estimated effect in the post-event period is not driven by changes in institutional ownership, Total $I O$ is measured as of the pre-event period.  \n\nPanel A of Table 3 reports regression results for treated firms only (firms belonging to several categories of extractive industries) for which we estimate  \n\n$$\nL o g(S c o r e_{i})=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}T o t a l~I O_{i}+\\beta_{2}P o s t~E\\nu e n t+\\beta_{3}T o t a l~I O_{i}\\times P o s t~E\\nu e n t+\\gamma^{\\prime}Y_{i t}+\\Lambda+\\varepsilon_{i},\n$$  \n\nwhere the dependent variables are the log of firms’ environmental scores and Post Event equals one for the years 2011 and 2012 and zero otherwise [all other variables are as in Eq. 1]. The coefficient of interest is $\\beta_{3}$ for the interaction term Total $I O\\times$ Post Event. We use three alternative industry classifications to identify treated firms in extractive industries: two-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code in column 1 (SIC 13, Oil and Gas Extraction), Fama and French (FF) industry in Column 2 (FF 17, Oil and Petroleum Products), and SIC division in Column 3 (SIC Division B, Mining). For all subsamples, the coefficient estimate of $\\beta_{3}$ is positive and significant at the $5\\%$ level or better, indicating that the relation between institutional ownership and firms’ environmental performance has strengthened after the Deepwater Horizon shock.? This is consistent with the channel of influence going from institutional ownership to firms? environmental performance.  \n\n# --- INSERT TABLE 3 NEAR HERE --  \n\nIn Panel B of Table 3, we report difference-in-differences estimates, using the entire sample. Our   coefficient of  interest is’the triple interaction coefficient for Total 10xPost Event $\\times$ Treated Firm that captures the difference of the effect of Total $I O$ for treated firms relative to control firms after the event. Our findings are very similar, and they confirm the positive and significant effect of the unexpected Deepwater Horizon event on the relation between institutional ownership and firms? E performance.  \n\nWe also explore the impact of Deepwater Horizon on firms′ social performance levels using an identical structure to Table 3. We report these results in Table OB2 in Online Appendix B. Consistent with the environmental shock sharpening institutions′ focus on environmental instead of social performance, we find no impact of this shock on firms? social performance.  \n\n### 3.3 Additional robustness tests  \n\nWe conduct other robustness tests. First, we use additions to the MSCI All Country World Index as an instrument for institutional ownership, discussed in detail in the Online Appendix (Table OB3). We find that instrumented institutional ownership predicts firms’ E&S performance. More important, consistent with the quasi-natural experiment, the evidence indicates a direction of causality from institutional ownership to firms’ E&S performance.  \n\nSecond, a concern arises that the results could be driven by firm characteristics that affect both investors’ choice of firms to invest in and firms’ E&S performance. The inclusion of firmlevel controls and industry and time fixed effects in the main specification alleviates the concern that the result comes from observable firm characteristics. We introduce a firm fixed effects model that controls for time-invariant unobserved firm characteristics (Gormley and Matsa, 2014). The results, discussed in detail in Online Appendix B (Table OB4) are very similar, with consistent positive and significant effects of institutional ownership on subsequent firm E&S performance.  \n\nThird, we explore whether our results are influenced by the choice of a specific E&S data provider, by obtaining firm-level data on E&S performance from Sustainalytics and Bloomberg. We reestimate our baseline models using these data and find that institutional ownership remains positively and significantly related to firms’ E&S performance (see Table OB5 in Online Appendix B). Finally, to ensure that our results are not driven by a firm's E&S transparency or by its corporate governance, we explicily control for transparency using ASSET4 transparency scores and for a firm's governance using a measure of insider control. All of our results continue to hold (see Table OB6 in Online Appendix B).  \n\nWe find that, in aggregate, institutional investors play an important role in improving E&S performance in firms across the world, and the evidence suggests that the relation is causal. Because owners are pushing for greater E&S performance, our results indicate that firms’ E&S choices are not explained solely by managerial agency costs.  \n\n## 4. What mechanisms do institutional investors use to push for E&S changes?  \n\nIn this section, we assess the mechanisms that institutional investors use to drive E&S performance changes. Firms enjoy a lower cost of capital if they can make themselves attractive to a greater pool of shareholders. Thus, investors can use the threat of exit, or the threat of selecting only firms with specific E&S policies, to indirectly influence firms’ choices. Investors can engage with management using the voice that comes with their shareholding to influence firms’ E&S policies (Hirschman, 1970; Gillan and Starks, 2000, 2003; Edmans, 2009; Edmans and Manso, 2011; Edmans and Holderness,2017). The consistent presence of institutional investors $85\\%$ of institutional ownership in a given firm is held by the same institutional investors from one year to the next) makes voice and the threat of exit plausible channels.  \n\n### 4.1 Exit and selection  \n\nThere is evidence indicating that investors use exit and selection to influence firms? E&S performance. Some investors use negative screening to exclude poor E&S performers or positive screening to buy only firms above certain E&S thresholds (e.g., socially responsible funds or impact funds; e.g., Barber, Morse, and Yasuda, 2017). Yet, it remains unclear how significant this is for investors as a whole. Negative screening is used by few institutional investors and excludes few companies. For example, the Norwegian Global Pension Fund had investments in more than 9,050 firms around the world as of December 2015, but it blacklisted only 66 firms.10 The positive screening used by socially responsible funds represents only a small fraction of institutional ownership.  \n\nWe explore whether exit and selection is an important mechanism for institutional investors’ push for E&S performance using Granger causality tests. We estimate two symmetric sets of regressions. First, similar to our tests so far, we regress E&S scores on lagged Total I0, lagged E&S scores, and lagged control variables. Second, consistent with screening and exit being important, we regress Total $I O$ on lagged E&S scores, lagged Total IO, and lagged control variables. Granger causality has been widely applied in economic research, and interpretations of the causality concept have been broadly debated such that caveats associated with its usage are well understood. With panel data, in which time series tend to be relatively short but available for a great number of cross-sectional units, parameter estimation is performed by pooling the data, and allowing for differences in individual effects can be achieved by including fixed effects (see, e.g., Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen, 1988). We follow this approach and include firm fixed effects.  \n\nIn results presented in Table OB7 in Online Appendix B we do not find support for exit and selection being important as a determinant for institutional ownership. Total IO does not depend on lagged E&S scores (while controlling for lagged Total IO). We instead find support for our baseline results of institutional ownership driving firms’ E&S performance. E&S scores significantly depend on lagged Total IO (while controlling for lagged E&S performance). These findings suggest that exit and selection does not account for broad changes in firms E&S performance. An additional benefit of these Granger causality tests is that, like the Deepwater  \n\nHorizon quasi-natural experiment, they help rule out reverse causality as an alternative explanation for our results.11  \n\n### 4.2 Voice  \n\nGiven these results, we expect investors’ voice to be a dominant mechanism that drives E&S changes. Evidence that voice is important includes the growth in investor organizations such as the UN PRI. Being a signatory requires investors to commit to actively engage with firms to improve their E&S commitments and allows for collaboration.  \n\nVoice could be publicly observable, such as in shareholder proposals and voting, or could be used in private engagements between investors and firms. Annual reports of major institutional investors and investor groups provide anecdotal evidence that private, not public, engagement is the primary mechanism to obtain E&S changes. This is consistent with recent evidence showing that institutional investors engage firms through private channels (McCahery, Sautner, and Starks, 2016; Amel-Zadeh and Serafeim, 2017) and that private engagements could be the most effective type of activism (Becht, Franks, Mayer, and Rossi, 2009).  \n\nTo test the voice mechanism, one would ideally use a comprehensive database of both private and public activism around the world. Unfortunately, such data do not yet exist. Even public activism data, which would include shareholder proposals, voting tallies, and voting outcomes (including those for withdrawn proposals), are not yet available from commercial data providers for a/global sample.12 For the third-largest sample country in our data, Canada, we are able to collect such data. Canada has a large share of natural resource firms that are likely to be the focus of investor activism, and its study thus should shed light on investor activism globally.  \n\nIf shareholder proposals are an important mechanism to drive E&S changes around the world [Del Guercio and Tran (2012) find this to be the case for US firms], we expect them to be both common and effective. We investigate this using the SHARE.ca database, which tracks all shareholder proposals in Canada, and restrict our attention to firms with available E&S data from ASSET4 in our sample period. The results, reported in Table OB8 in Online Appendix B, show that only 147 E&S proposals are made in 53 firms over our sample period, constituting $6\\%$ of firm-years.  \n\nTo judge the effectiveness of these proposals, looking solely at vote outcomes is not sufficient because more than $60\\%$ of the time a proposal never comes to a shareholder vote. We conduct a case study analysis and categorize each proposal as successful or not, consulting data from SHARE.ca, the websites of the proposal maker, and news sources.13 As the results show, shareholder proposals are frequently successful; $45\\%$ of environmental proposals and $21\\%$ of social issue proposals succeed. We also test whether investor engagement of firms via a shareholder proposal is associated with subsequently higher E&S scores as measured by ASSET4 E&S scores. Panel B of Table OB8 reports results similar to our baseline specifications, using shareholder proposals as an additional explanatory variable for E&S performance. In the regression, Shareholder Proposals is a dummy variable equal to one for the two years following the submission of a shareholder proposal and zero otherwise. The results show the impact of shareholder proposals, with a subsequent increase in E&S performance (statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level for E scores but not for S scores).  \n\nImportantly, we find that successful proposals are rarely voted on. For E proposals, only $6\\%$ of the succesful ones are voted on; for S proposals, the fraction is only $3\\%$ . For proposals that do get voted on, the percentage vote in favor is low, averaging about $10\\%$ $12\\%$ for E proposals and $8.5\\%$ for S proposals). These findings indicate that E&S shareholder proposals are primarily used as a lever to enhance the effectiveness of private negotiations. 1  \n\nPublic engagement through shareholder proposals, given their scarcity, is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism that investors use to drive firms’ E&S performance. Further, in a nonUS sample, liev, Lins, Miller, and Roth (2015) show that shareholder proposals are extremely rare. We conclude that private engagement is the most likely channel through which investors push firms for stronger E&S performance. While private engagements can in some cases entail (observable) shareholder proposals, they do not require them to be effective [see Becht, Franks, Mayer, and Rossi (2009) for UK targets of shareholder activism and Dimson, Karakas, and Li (2015) for US targets].  \n\n## 5. Why do institutional investors’ push firms to improve E&S performance?  \n\nIn this section, we examine the motivations behind institutional investors′ push for E&S performance. We propose that they are motivated by financial returns, or by social returns, or a combination of both.  \n\n### 5.1. Financial motivations to improve E&S performance  \n\nE&S investment could be value enhancing by providing a form of insurance against event risk or product market differentiation, or both (Servaes and Tamayo, 2013; Hong and Liskovich, 2016; Albuquerque, Koskinen, and Zhang, 2017; Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo, 2017). Many  \n\ninvestors use such motivations to explain their E&S activism, and these investors often note that E&S spending is aimed at a long-term, instead of short-term, payof.14  \n\n### 5.2. Social motivations to improve E&S performance  \n\nInstitutional investors also could push to improve firms’ E&S performance levels because of social pressures they face. Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2006) show pervasive effects of culture, a broad term that captures beliefs, values, and norms of a group or society, on a range of economic outcomes. In this paper, we focus on the pressure coming from social norms regarding firms’ E&S performance.  \n\nAkerlof and Kranton (2005, p. 12) provide a definition of norms (\\*\"peoples’ views of how they, and others, should or should not behave\") and show that social norms can significantly influence agents’ behavior. The necessary ingredients for norms to matter for investment managers are that managers identify themselves with a particular community, the community has views regarding appropriate firm-level E&S performance (ideals), and the investment manager receives social rewards for aligning her portfolio firms’ E&S performance with community ideals and faces social penalties if there is weak alignment.  \n\nFurther, social norms matter if institutional investors are trying to reflect the preferences of their beneficiaries as in Hart and Zingales (2017). To the extent a community has consistent views toward E&S,Jinstead of divergent ones, the investment manager more likely reflects those preferences in her engagements with firms.  \n\nIn exploring the hypothesis that social norms matter, we are not making a statement that norms are Pareto-improving. Prior research in other contexts shows that they perhaps are or are not (Arrow, 1971; Akerlof, 1980; Elster, 1989). In the E&S context, we simply record the environmental and social norms and test whether these influence investors’ impact on firms' E&S performance.  \n\n### 5.3 A simple framework  \n\nWe introduce a parsimonious framework to capture the potential impact of both financial returns and social norms on an investment manager's E&S choices. The framework builds on the models of Akerlof and Kranton (2005) as extended in Benjamin, Choi, and Strickland (2010).  \n\nFor simplicity, consider a situation in which an investment manager owns one firm and chooses $x$ , which is the E&S performance of that firm. A level $x_{o}$ exists that maximizes firm value. Also, a level $x_{c}$ is the preferred level of E&S performance for that firm based on the views of members in the community in which the investment manager lives. Investment managers differ in the utility they derive from living up to such social norms, which we capture through a weight $w(s)$ where $w(o)=0$ and ${\\mathcal{W}}^{\\prime}>O$ . Thus, in making a choice about $x.$ .an investment manager faces both a utility loss from deviating from the ideal choice from a financial perspective and a utility loss from deviating from the ideal social choice in her community. A functional form to capture this trade-off is provided in Eq. (3), where the investment manager chooses x to maximize  \n\n$$\nM a x E\\big[U\\big]=-\\big(1-w\\big(s\\big)\\big)\\big(x-x_{o}\\big)^{2}-\\big(w\\big(s\\big)\\big)\\big(x-x_{c}\\big)^{2}.\n$$  \n\nThis framework illustrates the potential importance of both social and financial returns. For an investment manager who derives no utility from social norms, $w(s)=0$ and the manager chooses $x_{o}$ , the E&S performance that maximizes firm financial performance. Otherwise, the manager needs to consider the gap between firm E&S performance and community ideals.  \n\nProfound differences exist across countries in the strength of E&S concerns, and these differences in social norms are persistent. If the investment manager lives in a community with high social norms for E&S performance, so that $x_{c}>x_{o}$ , the investment manager minimizes disutility loss by raising firm E&S performance toward community norms, with the intensity dependent upon $w(s)$ , how much the manager cares about living up to community norms, and $x_{c}$ the strength of the community norms regarding firms′ E&S performance. The same logic carries through when we consider institutional investors that own a portfolio of firms.  \n\nTo facilitate the identification of financial returns as a motivation we look for situations in which the level $x_{o}$ , the E&S performance that maximizes firm value, unexpectedly increases. In this circumstance, a financially motivated investor seeks to increase firms’ E&S performance levels. The Deepwater Horizon environmental shock provides an example as the cost from not having robust environmental practices was revealed to be unexpectedly large. If, after such a shock, E&S performance increases significantly, one can conclude that this choice is driven by financial motivations.  \n\nTo facilitate the identification of social norms as a motivation, we focus on investors? foreign holdings. To the extent that a firm's board and management team and its domestic institutional investors are both affected by their country-of-domicile E&S social norms, it would be challenging to isolate whether firm managers or domestic investors are behind a firm's E&S performance. Foreign investors are unlikely to obtain private benefits other than through the social norm channel, given the geographic separation between them and firm headquarters. Therefore, we use the social norms of foreign institutional owners, who account for two-thirds of institutional ownership in the data, to test whether investor social norms influence firm-level E&S performance. Such a finding would indicate that institutional investors are, in effect, transplanting their social norms across countries.  \n\n### 5.4 Tests of the importance of financial motivations  \n\nThe results reported in Table 3 illustrate the importance of financial motivations for investors’ push for firms’ E&S performance using the impact of the unexpected costs from the Deepwater Horizon event. In that situation, the increase in investors′ push for E&S performance was found only for environmental performance and only for the extractive industries.  \n\nIn this subsection, we follow a similar logic but explore a shock that affects the financial value of both environmental performance and social performance for firms. Following Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo (2017), we use the 2008-2009 global financial crisis as such a shock. As they argue and find, the financial crisis revealed the financial value of firm-level social capital and trust (as captured by E&S performance scores).They report higher crisis period returns for firms that entered the crisis with higher E&S performance. If financial motivations are important, we expect that firms with greater institutional ownership during the global financial crisis period would subsequently display higher E&S performance levels, as these institutional owners have a financial motive to force through policy changes because the value-maximizing level of $x_{o}$ has arguably increased.)  \n\nWe test for this in Table 4, using a Post Crisis dummy variable (similar to Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo, 2017) that is zero for fiscal years ending between August 31, 2008 and August 30, 2009 and equals one for fiscal years ending between August 31, 2009 and August 30, 2011. The two-year post-crisis observations are collapsed into one observation. Total $I O$ is  the total institutional ownership measured in the fiscal year preceding the crisis period.  \n\n# ---INSERT TABLE 4NEARHERE --  \n\nThe results are similar to those reported earlier, with institutional ownership again predicting higher subsequent E&S scores. Our focus is on the positive and significant ( $\\overset{\\cdot}{p}$ -value< $1\\%$ coefficient on the Post Crisis dummy interacted with total institutional ownership. This indicates that the already significant impact of institutional ownership on firms’ E&S performance increases following the financial crisis. We conclude from this quasi-natural experiment that financial motivations play an important role in investors^ push for greater E&S commitments.  \n\n### 5.5. Tests of the importance of social motivations, country-level social norms  \n\nTo test whether social returns are motivating investors, we begin by collecting data for social norms across countries. Social norms can be measured as observed policies and outcomes in a society or as expressed values and aspirations of individuals. We use both approaches. To measure a country's social norms toward the environment, we use the Environmental Performance Index, obtained from the Yale Center for Environmental Law (Yale University) and Center for International Earth Science Information Network (Columbia University) for the year 2004. The EPI is an observed-outcome metric that aggregates country-level data on environmental health and ecosystem vitality. Higher index values indicate better environmental performance in a country.  \n\nTo measure social norms toward worker rights and other social issues, we use the Employment Laws Index from Botero, Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2004, p. 1353). This index is an observed-outcome metric for a country's protection of labor that captures the “cost to the employer of deviating from a hypothetical rigid contract.\" Many of the line items in ASSET4's social commitment data are related to worker rights, making this a plausible proxy for social norms. 1 Higher index values indicate stronger protection of labor.  \n\nBecause a society's attitudes and beliefs toward E&S issues can be different from observed outcomes, we also use data from the extensive World Values Survey to construct an aggregate E&S social norm measure. wvS data come from interviews with representative samples of one thousand to four thousand individuals in more than one hundred countries, conducted in waves over several years, assessing peoples’ values and beliefs using common questionnaires. Survey questions from the WVS have been used to measure social norms in prior work (e.g., La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1997; Glaeser, Laibson, Scheinkman, and Soutter, 2000; Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales, 2003). Our World Values E&S Index uses 12 questions from the WvS that assess a society's values regarding environmental activism, lifestyle liberty, gender equality, personal autonomy, and the voice of the people. We aggregate responses to these questions following the methodology of Welzel (2013).16 Higher index values indicate stronger values and beliefs toward E&S. The Environmental Performance Index, Employment Laws Index, and World Values E&S Index measures are available for $85\\%$ $75\\%$ , and $79\\%$ of investors? countries in our sample, respectively, representing between $96\\%$ and $99\\%$ of total institutional ownership.  \n\nTable 5 reports descriptive statistics of E&S social norms across countries, sorted by the average of the three indexes. European countries rank high in social norms toward E&S, holding the top 17 spots. The top five countries are Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Countries in Asia, Australasia, and Africa are at the bottom of the list.  \n\n# ---INSERT TABLE5NEARHERE ---  \n\nE&S social norm differences across countries are strongly persistent to the extent that we can measure these in the available data. To illustrate, for the EPI, a comparison of country rankings in 2004 and 2014 yields a rank correlation of 0.99. We find similarly strong persistence of social norms when we use the World Values E&S Index.17  \n\nFor our primary tests of whether social norms in the country of domicile of foreign institutional investors influence investors’ E&S impact, we sort foreign institutional ownership into high and low social norm groups. We rank all institutional investors by their countries' social norms and sort them into two groups using the medians of the social norm measures as cutoff points. Lacking additional data, we assume the ultimate beneficiaries of the investment manager are located in the country of the investing fund.  \n\nPanels A and B of Table 6 report the results for environmental and social scores, respectively, in each case showing the impact of both an output-based and a survey-based measure of E&S norms. For both E&S scores and for both measures of social norms, foreign institutional ownership of the high social norm group is positively and significantly associated with E&S scores, and the ownership of the low social norm group is generally not significantly related to E&S scores (with the exception of Models 1 and 3 in Panel B). Further, in seven out of eight models, the coefficient on foreign institutional ownership from the high group is significantly larger than the corresponding one for the low group ( $\\overset{\\cdot}{p}$ -values reported in the last row of Panels A and B, respectively).  \n\n# ---INSERT TABLE 6NEARHERE --  \n\nThe impact of social norms is also economically meaningful. For example, based on the results of Column 1 in Panels A and B of Table 6, if foreign institutional investors from countries with low social norms were to pressure firms on E&S in the same manner as investors from countries with high social norms, firms’ environmental performance would increase by $7.4\\%$ (calculated as $[0.948~-~(-0.001)]~\\times~0.078)$ and social performance would increase by $5.2\\%$ [calculated as $(0.556-0.063)\\times0.105]$ . Overall, these results on social norms carry a significant implication for global capital markets as they show that high social norm foreign institutional investors, in effect, transplant their social norms to the foreign firms they hold.18  \n\nOne potential concern is that our measures of E&S social norms are correlated with other omitted country level factors, which could drive firms' E&S performance. For example, investors from wealthy countries could be the ones pushing for more E&S at firms or activism experience from being domiciled in countries with strong investor protection laws could be behind our results. Therefore, we construct alternative measures of social norms that are orthogonal to citizen wealth and two proxies for investor protection. To do so, we regress the original social norm measures on gross domestic product per capita (as of 2004, measured in US dollars); one investor protection proxy [Legal, calculated as the product of the Revised Antidirector Rights Index (Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer, 2008), and Rule of Law (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1998)], used in Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2007); and another investor protection proxy (Common Law legal origin dummy; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1998) we retain the residuals from these regressions. With these orthogonalized alternative measures of social norms, we again sort foreign investor ownership into high and low social norm groups and replicate the models of Table 6. The effect of foreign investor ownership on firms’ E&S performance is significantly greater in the high compared with the low social norm group in all models (see Table OB9 in Online Appendix B).  \n\nAnother potential concern is that our results are driven solely by US and UK institutions that account for the majority of foreign institutional ownership. In Table OB10 in Online Appendix B we reestimate our models for a sample that excludes all USjand UK institutional investor stakes. The results are generally unchanged. The impact of foreign institutional ownership is driven by high E&S norm countries, with a significantly greater impact from these countries compared with low E&S norm countries.  \n\nOur tests so far place foreign investors into two broad categories based on their country of domicile social norms. We can further test the social norm hypothesis by considering investors’ geographic location, as investors in the same region can share similar norms. As reported in Table 5, for example, European countries rank high in social norms. Do they also have the greatest impact on firms’ E&S performance?  \n\nIn Table 7. we group institutional ownership by geography and then repeat our regressions. We find that European investors drive firms’ E&S performance. Their coefficient estimate is always positive and significant. Investors domiciled in the Americas or in Asia and Australasia do not significantly impact E&s.19 While African institutional ownership is negatively related to E&S performance, it is modestly significant in only one model.  \n\n# ---INSERT TABLE 7NEAR HERE --  \n\nIn an additional set of tests, we run identical regressions as in Tables 6 and 7 but, instead of estimating the impact by social norm group or geographic region, we estimate the coefficient of foreign institutional ownership for each country in our sample. To facilitate interpreting these results, we present them graphically in Fig. 2. As both panels show, a positive relation exists between social norms (vertical axis) and the country-level coefficient estimates of foreign owners’ impact on firms? E&S performance (horizontal axis). European countries, in green, cluster in the top right part of the figure, consistent with both high norms and high E&S impacts. Among them, the Netherlands has the largest estimated impact on E&S. Within the Americas, in red, the US is far to the left on the E score and middle of the pack on the S score, indicating that US investors do not play a leading role in driving firms' E&S performance.  \n\n-- INSERT FIG. 2 NEAR HERE --  \n\n### 5.6. Tests of the importance of social motivations, investor type  \n\nAnother avenue to identify the importance of social returns for investors is to group investors not by geography, but by investor type.  \n\nThe most interesting category is investment companies and advisors. They face a clear trade-off. Their managers compete for capital and lower performance affects fund flows, heightening the importance of financial returns. But they are also exposed to social norms as they need to network and raise capital locally and are mindful of local E&S social norms. If the local E&S preferences are for high levels of E&S, they are more likely to communicate those preferences to the firms they control, hoping to satisfy their investors.  \n\nPension plans’ long investment horizon allows them to ask firms to incur E&S costs now for benefits potentially far in the future.\"° Hedge funds’ relatively short investment horizon is unlikely to support E&S spending that could pay off over a long horizon and they generally have strong management contracts that reduce their exposure to their ultimate beneficiaries’ social preferences.  \n\nWe use Factset's classification of investors for these tests. Four of its investor categories account  for $98.7\\%$ of  our  total institutional  ownership:  investment  advisors ${\\bf\\zeta}_{66.9\\%}$ of institutional ownership), investment companies $(22.2\\%)$ , pension funds $(8.1\\%)$ , and hedge funds $(1.5\\%)$ .21 To facilitate comparison with the literature on corporate governance activism, we group investment advisors and investment companies into a category called “independent institutional investors\" following Ferreira and Matos (2008), among others.  \n\nIn Table 8, we show the impact of investor type on E&S performance. Regardless of social norms, pension plans consistently influence firms to strengthen E&S performance, with positive and significant coefficients in 15 of the 16 models. Hedge fund ownership has no relation with E&S performance, consistent with expectations.  \n\n# -INSERT TABLE 8 NEAR HERE --  \n\nWe focus our attention on independent institutional investors. For environmental performance (Panel A), in the high social norm group the coefficient on independent institutional investor ownership is consistently economically large and statistically significant. In the low social norm group, the coefficient on independent institutional investors has a lower magnitude and is never statistically significant (the differences in coefficients between the high and low group are also statistically significant). We conclude that, if social norms are strong, independent investors transmit them when they invest abroad.  \n\nFor social performance (Panel B), we find similar, but less pronounced, results. The coefficient on independent institutional investors is always higher in the high social norm group than the low social norm group and it is always statistically significant. In the low social norm group, in two of the four models, the coefficient on independent institutional investors is also significant, and in only one of the four models is the difference between the coefficient on independent institutional investors in the high and low social norm groups significant.  \n\n### 5.7 Summary: financial and social motivations  \n\nOverall, this section establishes the empirical importance of both financial and social motivations for investors’ E&S activism. The results can be explained better with both motivations than solely with one or the other.  \n\nFinancial motivation is clearly illustrated by the Deepwater Horizon and financial crisis shocks in which investor pressure for E&S increased following the observed financial benefits of high levels of E&S. Evidence for social motivations comes first from our finding that investors from countries that rank high on measures of E&S social norms affect firms’ E&S performance, and investors fromJcountries that are relatively unsupportive toward E&S issues do not drive firms′ E&S performance.?? The importance of social motivations is further highlighted when we focus on independent institutional investors who compete for capital and must trade off financial returns with a desire to reflect their communities’ social norms toward E&s. When these independent investors are from high social norm countries they also push for greater E&S in their portfolio firms, reflecting this trade-off. Finally, our results showing an increase in investor pressure for E&S after the financial crisis from investors domiciled in low social norm countries clearly suggests that financial motivations have become more important in recent years.  \n\n5.8 Do institutional investors impact US firms' E&S performance?  \n\nIn a final set of tests, we replicate our analysis using US instead of non-US firms, which allows us to provide new evidence on activism within US firms. We report these results in Table 9, where we replicate our baseline tests of Table 2, Panel A, and Table 6, using as a new sample US firms that have data available in the ASSET4 ESG database, Factset, and Worldscope.  \n\n--- INSERT TABLE 9 NEAR HERE --  \n\nPanel A of Table 9 reports results for total institutional ownership in aggregate, which includes a substantial percentage of US-based investors. We find a positive but not always significant impact on E&S performance. Panels B and C isolate domestic and foreign institutional ownership and segment by social norms. Domestic (i.e., US) institutional investors have no impact on E performance of US firms, consistent with their lack of impact on E performance when they invest abroad.?3  \n\nForeign investors that come from high E&S norm countries have a strong and significant impact $\\mathbf{\\bar{\\rho}}$ -value $<1\\%$ ) on both E and S performance for US firms. The coefficient estimates are substantially larger than for our non-US sample, but their economic impact is blunted by the fact that non-US institutional owners own less of US firms. The economic impact on E performance is two-thirds that found in the non-US sample and on S performance is one-half that found in the non-US sample.24 We conclude that foreign investors also transplant their social norms when they invest in the US, and should such foreign institutional ownership increase it is predicted to have a significant impact on the E&S practices of US firms.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nUsing a comprehensive sample of publicly traded firms across more than 40 countries, we provide new evidence that institutional investors push for stronger firm-level E&S performance around the world. That is, firms are stepping up their E&S performance because investors are asking for it.  \n\nWe use both time series and cross-sectional tests to understand better what motivates investors to push for greater E&S performance. Utilizing the global financial crisis as a natural experiment, we find a strong role for financial motivations. Firms with greater institutional ownership pushed harder for improved E&S performance after recognizing the value of E&S during this crisis period.  \n\nWe also ask whether a desire to move firms? E&S performance toward the ideal of those in the investors’ local community could drive investors to advocate for greater E&S performance. If only financial motivations matter, cultural and social norms should play no role. We instead find that cultural origin matters. Foreign institutional investors domiciled in countries with social norms supportive of strong E&S commitments are the ones that impact firms’ E&S performance. This result suggests that a society's social norms flow through the channel of portfolio investment into firms and provides new evidence on the way in which culture makes its way into economic decision making.  \n\nFinally, our results on a sample of US firms indicate that those foreign investors from high social norm countries are already active and successful in pushing US firms to improve their E&S performance. These E&S-minded foreign investors own a relatively small fraction of US firms. If they were to increase their ownership in a meaningful way, we predict substantial changes in the E&S performance of US firms.  \n\n## References  \n\nAggarwal, R., Erel, I., Ferreira M.

Panel A shows environmental and social scores for the full sample. The category scores are calculated as the sum of all indicator variables in each category divided by the number of reported items times one hundred. The overall score is the average of the category scores. Online Appendix A describes the indicator variables used to calculate the environmental and social scores. The ASSET4 z-scores are standardized scores, calculated by and obtained from ASSET4 ESG, and measure firms’ environmental and social performance relative to other companies in a given year. Panel B shows means of environmental and social scores as well as institutional ownership by country for year 2010. The data are from the ASSET4 ESG database and Factset and are obtained for the years 2004-2013. All variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles.  \n\nTable1 Summary statistics of environmental and social scores

The dependent variables are the natural logarithm of environmental and social scores. Total IO is total institutional ownership, Log (total assets) is the natural logarithm of a firm's total assets, Tangibility is property, plant, and equipment to total assets, Leverage is total debt to total assets, Tobin's q is market capitalization of equity plus total debt divided by total assets, Profitability is net income plus after-tax interest expenses to total assets, and Cross-list is a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is cross-listed on a major US exchange, and zero otherwise. The data are from the ASSET4 ESG database, Factset, Worldscope, depositary receipt lists, and the Center for Research in Security Prices, and they are obtained for the years 2004-2013. Panel A uses the full sample. Panel B groups institutional ownership by whether institutional investors are United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment signatories or not. Panel C uses subsamples. The below-median subsample contains firms that have environmental and social scores below the sample median at the time they enter the sample. The above-median subsample contains firms above (or equal) to the sample median at the time they enter the sample. Online Appendix A describes the indicator variables used to calculate the environmental and social scores. All variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. All right-hand-side variables are lagged by one year.

regression estimates of environmental scores on institutional ownership and control variables for years 2009 through 2012, which correspond to the four years surrounding the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that occurred on May 24, 2010. The dependent variables are the natural logarithm of environmental scores. The Post event dummy is equal to one for the years 2011 and 2012 and zero otherwise. The two-year pre- and post-event periods are each collapsed into one observation, and Total IO is the total institutional ownership measured over the pre-event period. In Panel A, we report within-industry results for firms in extractive industries. The coefficient estimate of Total $\\mathrm{IO}\\times\\mathrm{Post}$ event shows the differential effect of institutional ownership on environment scores after the event. In Panel B, we report difference-in-differences regression results. The coefficient estimate of Total $\\mathrm{IO}\\times$ Post event $\\times$ Treated firm shows the differential effect of institutional ownership on the environment scores for firms in extractive industries (treated firms) compared with the rest of the sample firms. The data are from the ASSET4 ESG database, Factset, Worldscope, depositary receipt lists, and the Center for Research in Security Prices.

Using establishment-level data from the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Business Database for 1982-2015, this paper examines the impact of increases in concentrated institutional ownership on employment, wages, shareholder returns, and labor productivity. Consistent with theory of the firm based on conflicts of interests between shareholders and stakeholders, we find that establishments of firms that experience an increase in ownership by larger and more concentrated institutional shareholders have lower employment and wages. This result holds in both panel regressions with establishment fixed effects and a difference-in-differences  design that  exploits  large  increases  in  concentrated  institutional ownership, and is robust to controls for industry and local shocks. The result is more pronounced in industries where labor is relatively less unionized, in more monopsonistic local labor markets, and for dedicated and activist institutional shareholders. The labor losses are accompanied by higher shareholder returns but no improvements in labor productivity, suggesting that shareholder power mainly reallocates rents away from workers. Our results imply that the rise in concentrated institutional ownership could explain about a quarter of the secular decline in the aggregate labor share.  \n\nAntonio Falato   \nFederal Reserve Board   \nMail Stop #89   \n20th Street & Constitution Ave. NW   \nWashington, DC 20551   \nantonio.falato@ frb.gov Hyunseob Kim   \nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago 230 South LaSalle St.   \nChicago, IL 60604   \nUnited States   \nhyunseob.kim @ chi.frb.org   \nTill M. von Wachter   \nDepartment of Economics   \nUniversity of California, Los Angeles   \n8283 Bunche Hall   \nMC 147703   \nLos Angeles, CA 90095   \nand NBER   \ntvwachter@ econ.ucla.edu  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThe decline of labor, amid stagnant wages and falling employment, is a well-documented stylized fact of US labor markets over the last decades (see, e.g., Autor and Katz, 1999; Pierce and Schott, 2016; and Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen, 2020). At the same time, public corporations, which account for half of private employment in the US, underwent radical changes in their ownership structure with the rising importance of large institutional shareholders. Figure 1 shows how one common measure of concentrated ownership for US public firms, block institutional ownership (defined as more than $5\\%$ stock holdings), increased threefold from 1980 to 2014. By the end of the period, on average concentrated institutional shareholders held over $20\\%$ of the equity shares of US public corporations. In parallel, Figure 1 shows that the “labor share,” measured as the ratio between aggregate wages and salaries to domestic gross income in the US, exhibited a steady decline.  \n\nClassical theory of the firm based on agency conflicts between shareholders and workers suggests these concurrent trends may partly reflect a direct link between the ownership structure of public corporations and their employment decisions. In fact, prominent commentators in the popular press and CEOs of large corporations have recently expressed concerns that the so-called “shareholder capitalism” - i.e., the North American style of governance that since the 1980s has centered around the maximization of shareholder value as the main objective of the firm - may have hurt workers.2 Growing evidence on the impact of governance on employment (e.g., Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; and Davis et al., 2014) and on the effect of declining worker power on wages (e.g., Stansbury and Summers, 2020; and Farber et al., 2021) suggest that the impact of increases in shareholder power on labor could be substantial. Yet, even though concentrated institutional shareholders now control a large share of publicly traded firms, there is little systematic evidence on their impact on employment, wages, and firm outcomes.  \n\n![](images/780d6c029fde0294793b282424039f9556a58292c3a4223e4155d8feb9c62171.jpg)  \nFigure 1: Trends in Concentrated Institutional Ownership of Public Firms and Employee Compensation-to-GD1 Ratio in the US, 1980-2014. This figure plots the average block institutional ownership for public firms (blue solid line; left panel) and the ratio of total wage and salary accruals to domestic gross income (GD1) (red dotted line; right panel) in the US for the period 1980-2014. The red linear lines in both panels show linear time trends. Institutional ownership is from Thomson Reuter 13F filings data and the compensation-to-GDI ratio is from the Federal Reserve Economic Data. Block institutional ownership is the percentage owned by institutional blockholders, defined as the institutional investors with more than $5\\%$ holdings as filed through Form 13D, 13F, or 13G. The average block ownership is calculated excluding firms in the agriculture, financial, utilities, and public administration sectors.  \n\nTo study the role of increases in shareholder power, proxied by concentrated institutional ownership, this paper uses micro data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). Specifically, we assemble a rich establishment-level dataset that spans the 1982 to 2015 period and contains information on employment, payroll, and detailed ownership structure for over seven million establishment-year observations. Using this dataset, we document that increases in shareholder power, measured by ownership of large and concentrated  institutional  shareholders, are reliably associated with reductions  in establishments? employment and wages.  \n\nOur analysis is guided by the classical agency theory of the firm, which dates back to Jensen and Meckling (1976) (see Shleifer and Vishny, 1997; and Stein, 2003, for comprehensive reviews). In this class of theory, there is a fundamental conflict of interests over the allocation of firm resources between shareholders and stakeholders, including workers. Shareholders with large and concentrated ownership could hurt workers through two distinct but related channels. First, they have more bargaining power and can more easily renege ex post on implicit contracts not to fire workers or cut payroll via restructurings or hostile takeovers, as in the “breach of trust\"’ hypothesis of Shleifer and Summers (1988). Second, they can more easily monitor managers and force them to fire workers or cut payroll against their will, as per the “quiet life” hypothesis of Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003). In both cases, the presence of powerful shareholders hurts labor.  \n\nConsistent with this agency view of the firm, we find that an increase in shareholder power due to growing concentration among institutional shareholders is associated with reliably lower employment and wages within establishments (i.e., using establishment fixed effects). Importantly, we confirm the negative relation in a difference-in-differences design that exploits large changes in powerful institutional ownership to addresses selection issues. The relation is robust to several robustness checks, which include using multiple proxies for shareholder power, such as the percentage ownership of the largest one or five institutional shareholders, blockholders (defined as institutional shareholders with an at least $5\\%$ Stake), and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of institutional investors’ ownership. The robustness and specification checks also include controling for time-varying industry and local market conditions, limiting the sample to manufacturing, and using the symmetric growth rate of employment or payroll, wages per employee, and indicators for forced layoff announcement as the outcome variable. The relation is economically significant across the measures of shareholder power: a 10-percentage point increase in large shareholder ownership is associated with a 2.1 to $2.5\\%$ reduction in a given establishment's employment and payroll. It also holds up in the aggregate at the industry sector level.3  \n\nAfter establishing the negative relation between shareholder power and labor outcomes, we take a step toward clarifying the mechanism by determining which powerful institutional shareholders have the larger impact on labor and when. First, we explore variation in worker bargaining power and find that the employment and payroll losses are larger in industries where a smaller fraction of workers is unionized and in local labor markets where firms have more bargaining power vis- $\\grave{\\cdot}\\grave{\\mathrm{a}}$ -vis workers. Second, the labor losses are accompanied by higher shareholder returns but lower labor productivity within one year and no apparent improvements in productivity over longer two- or three-year horizons. The short-run loss of output and efficiency is hard to reconcile with a monitoring channel and rather, in line with a wealth transfer from workers to shareholders. Finally, we find that only institutional shareholders with control motives - i.e., “\"dedicated”\" institutions based on the classification of Bushee (1998) or “activist’ institutions - have a strong negative association with employment and payrol. Other types of shareholders without control motives, such as “quasi-index” and \"transient’ institutions, have a weaker and if anything, positive relation with employment and payroll. Anecdotal evidence from shareholder activism campaigns further points to the maximization of shareholder value as the stated goal to reduce labor-related expenses. Overall, the collection of evidence indicates that shareholder power has largely a reallocative impact, as labor cuts take value away from workers toward shareholders without increasing firm revenues.  \n\nOur paper makes several key contributions to the literature. Our paper provides the first causal evidence of the impacts of concentrated institutional ownership on employment and wages for the universe of institutional shareholders and publicly traded firms in the US. We thereby contribute to the growing literature on the impact of corporate governance and labor. This literature has shown that measures of managerial entrenchment, such as state-level anti-takeover statutes and dual-class shares, are associated with higher wages (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; and Cronqvist et al., 2009). Another strand of this literature examines the impact on labor and productivity of ownership by specific types of institutions, such as private equity (Lichtenberg and Siegel, 1990; and Davis et al., 2014) and activist hedge funds (Brav, Jiang, and Kim, 2015). Our evidence is important in light of the fact that, as we show below, concentrated ownership constitutes up to forty percent of the overall ownership by institutions. In turn, institutions own on average more than half of the shares of US public corporations, which constitute over half of aggregate GDP and employment in the US. Hence, the negative causal effects of concentrated institutional ownership on employment and wages we document affect a substantial number of establishments and employees.  \n\nAnother primary contribution is to assess the impact of the substantial growth of powerful institutional shareholders in the US over recent decades on the sluggish employment and earnings growth and declining labor share in the US. Our finding that the rise in concentrated stock ownership has helped to depress the labor share complements a number of important explanations set forth, including technology (Acemoglu, 2002), import penetration (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, 2013; Acemoglu, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, and Price, 2016; and Pierce and Schott, 2016), industry concentration and superstar firms (Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen, 2020), and labor market concentration (Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim, 2022). A related recent literature also examines the role of firms in wagesetting (see, for example, Card, Heining, and Kline, 2013; and Song, Price, Guvenen, Bloom, and von Wachter, 2019). Our results reinforce these findings by providing a novel rationale for the role of firms in employment and wage setting decisions.  \n\nBy showing that increases in concentrated ownership by institutional shareholders lead to a decrease in wages accompanied by an increase in shareholder value, our findings are also complementary to an ongoing literature documenting the relative decline in worker power and its impact on wages and employment. For example, Stansbury and Summers (2020) use aggregate industry-level data on union membership to argue that reduced worker power provides an explanation for rising firm valuations amid stagnant wage growth and declining labor share. Farber et al. (2021) use microdata on union membership dating back to 1936 to show that unions reduce wage inequality. By providing firm-level evidence that the rise of powerful institutional shareholders caused a redistribution of rents away from labor to capital Owners, we document another important factor behind declining worker power. Our finding that rising shareholder power has larger effects if union representation is weak highlights a novel and potentially important interplay between these two channels.  \n\nA final contribution is that we take a first step toward clarifying the broader consequences of rising shareholder power for the productivity and stock market valuations of US firms. By doing so, we join a recent literature that uses microdata to better understand the determinants of value added and the declining labor share (see, for example, Kehrig and Vincent, 2021), which had not yet examined the role of concentrated institutional shareholders. These results also contribute to the broader literature on the consequences of concentrated institutional shareholders for US firms. For example, Aghion, Van Reenen, and Zingales (2013) study the role of institutional shareholders in the governance of innovation. This literature has traditionally focused on the overall level of institutional ownership. Our contribution here is to highlight that, in addition to the overall level, the concentration of institutional ownership matters for US firms. Consistent with the previous literature, we find that overall institutional Ownership is positively correlated with productivity. We then show that at least in the shortrun the relation with ownership concentration is negative and discuss an agency rationale for it. Leveraging microdata to further explore the broader consequences of ownership concentration for US firms constitutes an interesting avenue for future research.  \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and variables used and provides descriptive statistics. Section 3 details the main empirical specification, our main establishment-level results, and covers several specification and robustness checks. Section 4 explores mechanisms underlying the main results. Section 5 examines the aggregate implications. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Data and descriptive statistics  \n\nThis section describes the datasets used in the empirical analysis, sample selection procedures, and resulting samples.  \n\n### 2.1. Data sources and sample construction  \n\nOur data source for establishment observations is the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) from the US Census Bureau. The LBD is a comprehensive dataset of establishments in the United States, covering all private business establishments with at least one employee Jarmin and Miranda, 2002; and Chow et al., 2021). The dataset provides annual establishmentlevel information on employment, payroll, industry classification, and geographic location (such as counties).4 We use the log of establishment-level employment and payroll as main outcome variables in our empirical analysis.  \n\nIn addition, we use a set of control variables standard among research analyzing establishment-level data employing Census micro datasets (see, for example, Schoar 2002; and Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim, 2022). Specifically, firm size is measured by the log number of establishments of a given firm, while firm-segment size is measured by the log number of establishments belonging to the firm in a given three-digit standard industry code (SIC) industry. Establishment age is defined as the number of years since an establishment's inception—identified by the flag for establishment's inception in the LBD—or its first appearance in the LBD, whichever is the earliest. The starting year is censored in 1977 when the coverage of the LBD begins.  \n\nThe institutional ownership data are from Thomson Reuters 13F SEC filings. All institutional investment managers  with greater than $\\$100$ million in  equity  assets under discretionary management are required to file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. All common stock holdings of 10,000 or more shares or having a value of $\\$200,000$ or more must be reported. Qualified securities include stocks listed for trading in the US. The quarterly holdings reported in the Form 13F represent the aggregate holdings of an institution (e.g., the Vanguard family of funds), rather than the holdings of any individual portfolio (e.g., the Contra fund in the Fidelity family of funds). Throughout the paper, an institutional investor (or shareholder) is defined as an institution that files a 13F.  \n\nThe main ownership variables of interest are defined as the holdings in a given firm's equity shares by a given type of institutional investors as a percentage of shares outstanding. Overall nstitutional ownersbip is the percentage owned by all institutional investors. Top 1 ownersbip and Top 5 ownersbip are the percentages owned by the largest one and five institutional investors, respectively. Total block ownersbip is the percentage owned by all blockholding institutions, which are defined as the institutional investors with more than $5\\%$ holdings as filed through Form 13D, 13F, or 13G. To better distinguish between ownership types among institutional shareholders, we also consider three additional variables: Quasi-index ownersbip, Dedicated ownersbip, and Transient ownersbip, which are the percentages owned by quasi-index, dedicated, and transient institutional investors as classified by Bushee (1998), all scaled by Overall institutional ownersbip. Activist ownersbip is the percentage owned by activist institutional investors as classified by Grennan (2019) based on institutional investors that have engaged in shareholder activism campaigns, scaled by Overall institutional ownersbip.  \n\nWe require that each establishment observation from the LBD have non-missing, positive values for employment and payroll, as well as the one-year lagged observation, which is used in part of our analysis that uses the growth rate of employment or payroll as an outcome. We then match establishments  with firm-level institutional ownership variables from Thomson Reuters as of the first quarter of the previous year using the Census Bureau's bridge file between the firm identifiers in the LBD and Compustat.5 We require that establishments have the matched institutional ownership variables. We exclude the agriculture (SIC 0100- 0900), utilities (SIC 4900-4999), financials (SIC 6000-6999), and public administration (SIC 9000-9999) industries from our sample. This sample selection procedure yields approximately 7,340,000 establishment-year observations from 1982-2015 (the Thomson Reuters data are available from 1980 but we require up to two-year lagged institutional ownership variables for part of the analysis). A subsample for the manufacturing sector (SIC 2000-3999), which is used in part of our analysis, includes approximately 533,000 establishment-year observations. The numbers of observations are rounded to follow the Census Bureau's disclosure rules.  \n\nWe construct data on collective bargaining coverage by following the approach in Hirsch and Macpherson (2003) and Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim (2022). Below we provide a brief description of the data source and construction, and refer to Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim (2022) for details. We compute the fraction of workers covered by labor unions at the industry level using the Current Population Survey (CPS) Outgoing Rotation Groups (ORG) data. The resulting data provide union coverage rate estimates, defined as the number of employees covered by labor unions divided by total employment, by Census Industry Code (CIC). Because our establishment-level data use SIC codes, we match the union coverage data with Census establishment-level data at the industry level using the Census Bureau's concordances between CIC codes and SIC codes. Given that our industry-level database on union coverage begins in 1983 whereas our sample period starts in 1982, we impute the rate of collective bargaining coverage using the 1983 information for years 1981 and 1982.  \n\nLastly, we compute the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of firm employment from the LBD at the three-digit SIC industry-by-commuting zone level as the measure of local labor market concentration (Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim, 2022). This variable is an (inverse) proxy for employees’ bargaining power relative to shareholders. In the analysis of the mechanisms below, we supplement the main data with additional sources that include information on firm revenues from the revenue-enhanced LBD (RE LBD) and Compustat. The firm-level revenue variables are available from 1997 in the RE LBD and throughout the sample period in Compustat.  \n\n### 2.2. Descriptive statistics  \n\nTable 1 shows descriptive statistics for institutional ownership and establishment characteristics for establishments in the full sample Panel A) and in the manufacturing sample (Panel B) from 1982-2015. Focusing on the full sample, the average overall institutional ownership, shown under “Main control variables,” is $59.7\\%$ 。consistent  with rising \"institutionalization” of public firm ownership in the past decades. Panel B shows similar mean values of institutional ownership variables for manufacturing establishments. The high level of ownership by institutions in the US motivates our focus on concentrated ownership by these institutions, as the rest of the shares are held by more diffused investors, such as retail investors and insiders who hold smaller individual stakes.7  \n\nTurning to our main explanatory variables, the average ownership by the largest five institutional investors or by blockholders, defined as institutional investors with at least $5\\%$ ownership, are $23.7\\%$ and $14.7\\%$ , respectively, and exhibit considerable variation with a standard deviation of $12\\%$ and $14.5\\%$ . As for the additional explanatory variables, ownership by “quasi-index”’ institutions are $58.5\\%$ of all institutional ownership, whereas ownership by \"dedicated” institutions, likely active monitors, accounts for $13.1\\%$ of all institutional ownership. These statistics suggest that, while the bulk of institutional shareholding is across less active owners, large and active institutions hold considerable ownership stakes in US public corporations.  \n\n# [Insert Table 1 here.]  \n\nThe average establishment in the full sample employs 62 workers and pays about $\\$2.5$ million with average annual pay of $\\$29,500$ per worker with a standard deviation of $\\$28,400$ all shown under “Main dependent variables.\" Manufacturing establishments exhibit larger employment and payroll per establishment on average (296 and $\\$13.7$ million), relative to those in the full sample, with average annual pay of $\\$42,700$ per worker. As for the main control variables, the average establishment's (public) parent firm owns more than 2,000 establishments, and the average age of establishments is 10.8 years.  \n\n## 3. Empirical analysis  \n\nThis section provides baseline estimates for the within-establishment relation between ownership by large institutional shareholders and employment or payroll, explores large increases in institutional ownership as a quasi-experiment, and examines robustness of the baseline results.  \n\n3.1. Baseline results - ownersbip by large institutional sharebolders, employment, and payroll  \n\nWe estimate the relation between ownership by large institutional shareholders, which presumably increases shareholder power, and establishment-level employment and payroll using the following equation:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{{\\bf y}_{i j k t}={\\alpha_{i}}+{\\alpha_{k t}}+{\\beta_{1}}L a r g e I n s t i t u t i o n a l O w n e r s h i p_{j t-1}}\\ &{\\qquad+{\\beta_{2}}O v e r a l l I n s t i t u t i o n a l O w n e r s h i p_{j t-1}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\gamma^{\\prime}X_{i t-1}+{\\varepsilon_{i j k t}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{i j k t}$ is the $\\mathrm{log}$ of either of total employment or payroll, $i$ indexes establishment, j firm, k industry, and $t$ year; $a_{i}$ represents establishment fixed effects; $a_{k,t}$ represents three-digit SIC industry-by-year fixed effects; $L$ arge institutional ownersbipjir $\\cdot\\boldsymbol{I}$ is a measure of large institutional shareholders′ ownership; Overall institutional ownersbip;i-1 is overall institutional ownership; $X_{i t-1}$ is a set of establishment-level control variables, including firm size and firm-segment size, and $\\varepsilon_{i j k f}$ is the residual. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level.  \n\nThe coefficient of interest is $\\beta_{\\uparrow}$ which represents the within-establishment semielasticity of employment or payroll to a measure of large institutional ownership, after controling for overall institutional ownership, establishment-level covariates, and timevarying industry conditions. We first employ ownership by top institutional investors as a measure of large shareholder ownership, and then employ total institutional blockholder ownership and concentration of ownership across institutions. The premise is that institutional investors would have strong incentives to maximize shareholder value, as well as power to do sO, potentially at the expense of employees, when they have large fractional ownership (Shleifer and Vishny, 1986) or when ownership is concentrated in the hands of few institutional investors. The control for overall institutional ownership helps address alternative interpretations due to omitted factors not related to institutions’ incentives to monitor managers or bargaining power relative to employees. If our main estimates were due to omitted factors that drive institutions’ decisions to buy or sell shares in a given firm for reasons unrelated to monitoring or bargaining power, then we would expect the Large institutional ownersbip variables to have no incremental explanatory power after controlling for Overall institutional ownership.s  \n\nTable 2, Panel A shows estimation results for Eq. (1) using the top one and five institutional ownership variables on the full industry sample. Columns 1 and 2 (columns 3 and 4) present the baseline within-establishment relation between ownership of the top institutional shareholders and log employment (payroll). The coefficient on Top 1 ownership in column 1 is -0.217 and significant at a less than $1\\%$ level. This estimate shows that for a given business establishment, a ten-percentage point increase in the largest institution's ownership (relative to the mean of $8.7\\%$ ) is associated with a $2.1\\%$ $(=\\exp(-0.217\\times0.1)-1)$ ) decline in employment,  controlling  for  time-varying  industry  conditions and  establishment characteristics. The coefficient in column 3 shows a similar magnitude of a withinestablishment decline in payroll (by $2\\%$ $t{\\mathrm{-stat}}=5.22\\$ in response to a ten-percentage point increase in the largest institution's ownership. These significantly negative relations are consistent with the idea that when the firm's largest institutional shareholder increases ownership and, thus, incentives to monitor or bargaining power, it reduces employment and payroll at its establishments in an attempt to maximize shareholder value.  \n\nSimilarly, columns 2 and 4 show that the collective ownership of top five institutional shareholders is negatively associated with establishment-level employment and payroll (significant at a less than $1\\%$ level). A ten-percentage point increase in top five ownership is associated with $2.3\\%$ and $2.5\\%$ declines in number of employees and wage bills, indicating a similar magnitude of the association with that for top one ownership.  \n\nAcross the columns, the coefficients on control variables have expected signs - the log number of establishments per firm, a measure of the owner firm's scope, is significantly positively correlated with both establishment-level employment and payroll. Importantly, the coefficient on Overall institutional ownersbip is positive and generally smaller in magnitude than that of our main variables of interest, Large institutional ownership. The positive relation between general institutional ownership and employment and payroll indicates that, unless they are powerful, the presence of institutional shareholders may not in and of itself hurt workers. This can be the case either because diffused institutional shareholders do not have the ability to influence firm decisions on labor or because their objectives differ from those of large institutional shareholders, as it may be the case for passive buy-and-hold institutions. We explore this possibility in more detail in Section 4 by analyzing the effects by institution type.  \n\n[Insert Table 2 here.]  \n\nPanel B presents estimates of Eq. (1) on a subsample of manufacturing establishments. Similar to the full sample results in Panel A, the coefficients on top one and five ownership variables are consistently negative and significant at a less than $1\\%$ level. The economic magnitude of the effect is somewhat larger in manufacturing than for all industries - for example, estimates in columns 2 and 4 indicate that a ten-percentage point increase in top five institutional ownership is associated with $2.9\\%$ and $3.2\\%$ reductions in employment and payroll within establishments. This larger magnitude decline in manufacturing employment and payroll is consistent with existing work documenting that the decline of labor over the past decades is most pronounced in manufacturing (e.g., Pierce and Schott, 2016; and Autor et al., 2020).  \n\nNext, we explore how powerful institutional shareholders affect establishment-level employment and payroll by estimating Eq. (1) using total institutional blockholder ownership and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of institutional investors? ownership as measures of shareholder power. Table 3 shows the estimation results.  \n\n[Insert Table 3 here.]  \n\nThe coefficients on Total block ownersbip in columns 1 and 3 in Panel A show that, when a given establishment experiences a ten-percentage point increase in block institutional ownership, its employment and payroll decline by $1.5\\%$ and $1.7\\%$ (significant at a less than $1\\%$ level). Similarly, the significantly negative coefficients on HHI institutional ownersbip in columns 2 and 4 show that when ownership becomes more concentrated among few institutions, the establishment experiences reductions in employment and wage bills. A one-standard deviation (SD) increase in the HHI (0.110) would lead to an about $1\\%$ reduction in establishment employment and payroll.  \n\nPanel B presents estimates for establishments in the manufacturing sector, showing similarly negative within-establishment relations between changes in block ownership or concentration of ownership and employment and payroll. The economic magnitude of the effect is more pronounced in manufacturing particularly when the HHI is employed to measure shareholder power - the coefficient on the HHI is $52\\%$ (employment) to $104\\%$ (payroll) larger in manufacturing relative to the full set of industries as shown in Panel A.  \n\n### 3.2. Robustness tests  \n\nThis section examines the robustness of the baseline results to alternative specifications and definitions of the institutional ownership measures.  \n\n#### 3.2.1. Local labor market conditions  \n\nA potential concern for our baseline results is that ownership of large institutional investors is correlated with local labor market conditions, which would affect labor market outcomes such as employment and wages. For example, a spurious correlation may arise if large institutional investors target firms operating in labor markets that are expected to become smaller, in which employment and wages tend to decrease (e.g., Moretti, 2011). To mitigate this type of concern, we re-estimate the baseline regression in Eq. (1) with county-by-year fixed effects, and present estimation results in Row A.1 of Table 4.  \n\n[Insert Table 4 here.]  \n\nAcross the columns, the row shows that the estimated association of top one, five, block, or concentrated institutional ownership with labor quantities is more pronounced once time-varying local labor market conditions are controlled for. For example, relative to the employment effect estimate in Table 2, Panel A, column 1 (-0.217), the coefficient on Top 1 ownersbip in Table 4, Row A.1, column 1 (-0.286) is about one-third larger. Similarly, the estimated semi-elasticity of payroll to top one ownership in column 5 is about one-third larger than the comparable estimate in Table 2, Panel A, column 3 (-0.274 vs. -0.205). These results suggest that omitted time-varying local market conditions are unlikely to explain the baseline findings. In addition, Row A.2 of Table 4 shows that the results are robust to controlling for alternative measures of local labor market conditions using industry-by-commuting zone-byyear fixed effects.  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Alternative measures of institutional ownership  \n\nWe also re-estimate the baseline regression in Eq. (1) using a moving average of institutional ownership, which includes two recent lags, to allow for a delayed response of employment and payroll to ownership. Estimates in Table 4, Row B show that the effect of powerful institutional ownership, measured using moving averages, is consistently negative and highly statistically significant largely at a less than $1\\%$ level). Interestingly, the economic magnitude of the effect is generally larger than those of the baseline results in Tables 2 and 3, indicating that further lagged changes in large institutional ownership have a greater effect on labor, relative to more recent changes. For example, the coefficient on Top 5 ownersbip in column 2 (-0.321) is almost $40\\%$ larger than that on Top $5$ ownersbip in column 2 in Table 2, Panel A (-0.233).  \n\nOur main analysis controls for overall institutional ownership to ensure that the main estimates capture the effect of shareholder power due to large and concentrated ownership by institutional shareholders, rather than high institutional ownership that is widely held across many investors. We examine the robustness of our baseline results by employing an alternative specification that scales the measures of top and blockholder ownership by overallinstitutional ownership, instead of including it as a control variable. This alternative variable measures the relative importance of large institutional ownership among all institutional owners (same as the institution type shares employed in Section 4.3). The estimation results shown in Row C of Table 4 are largely similar to the baseline results in Tables 2 and 3. As the fraction of shares owned by top or blockholding institutions among all institutional ownership increases, employment and payroll of establishments owned by the firm decrease (all coefficients are significant at the $1\\%$ level). The coefficients on Top $5$ ownership/ Overall institutional ownersbip in columns 2 (-0.134) and 5 (-0.142) show that when the relative importance of top five institutional ownership (among all institutional ownership) increases by 10 percentage points, the establishment's employment and payroll would decline by $1.3\\%$ and $1.4\\%$ .Thus, Row C of Table 4 confirms that the baseline results are robust to how we control for overall institutional ownership. In addition, Row D of Table 4 shows that the results are also robust to another sensitivity check on the baseline specification, which is to drop the control for Overall institutional ownership altogether.  \n\n#### 3.2.3. Alternative specifications  \n\nIn additional robustness analysis, we consider two alternative specifications. First, we repeat the analysis at the firm instead of the establishment level using a specification that includes firm fixed effects and is otherwise the same as the baseline. While the establishmentlevel specification is more conservative because it controls for more granular establishment fixed effects, one concern is that it may under-estimate the labor impact because it focuses on the within-establishment intensive margin. In comparison, the firm-level specification examines whether large institutional owners affect employees also via the potentially important extensive margins, which include closure or sales of existing establishments (\\*establishment exit'\") and creation or purchases of new establishments (\"establishment entry\"). Panel A of Appendix Table A1 presents the results.? The firm-level estimates remain highly significant and are somewhat larger in magnitude than their establishment-level counterparts, suggesting that large institutional shareholders affect employees both at the intensive and extensive margins.  \n\nSecond, we employ an alternative specification that uses growth rates of establishmentlevel employment and payroll, instead of their log's, as dependent variables. Specifically, we estimate the following regression:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{g r o w t h_{i j k t}=\\alpha_{k t}+\\beta_{1}L a r g e I n s t i t u t i o n a l O w n e r s h i p_{j t-1}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\beta_{2}O v e r a l l I n s t i t u t i o n a l O w n e r s h i p_{j t-1}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\gamma^{\\prime}X_{i t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i j k t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere growt $b_{i j k,t}$ is the symmetric growth rate of total employment or payroll, defined as $(y_{i j k,t}-$ $y_{i j k t-1})/(y_{i j k t}+y_{i j k t-1})/2$ 7 indexes establishment, / firm, $k$ industry, and $t$ year; and all other variables are defined as in Eq. (1), except that $X_{i t-1}$ also includes establishment age. We use a symmetric measure of employment and payroll growth following Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996) to ensure that the result is not driven by the very largest employment or payrollincreases and decreases. We do not include establishment fixed effects in Eq. (2), given that calculating the growth rates within establishments is equivalent to differencing out the fixed effects in the outcome variables.  \n\nAppendix Table A1, Panel B shows estimation results of Eq. (2). The coefficients on top and block institutional ownership variables show a negative within-establishment relation between shareholder power and employment and pay growth rates, consistent with our baseline results for level changes. The negative relation is more pronounced for payroll growth relative to employment growth. For example, estimates in columns 1 and 5 show that a tenpercentage point increase in top institutional ownership is associated with a 0.3-percentage point reduction in employment growth rate but with a 0.8-percentage point reduction in payroll growth rate. This finding indirectly suggests that greater ownership by large institutional investors is associated with lower per-employee wage growth. Similarly, columns 2-3 and 6-7 show that top five and total block institutional ownership variables are also associated with slower employment and pay growth, while columns 4 and 8 indicate a muted effect of the HHI of institutional ownership on the growth of labor. Overall, we find qualitatively consistent results using growth rates of the employee outcomes as dependent variable, in place of the levels along with establishment fixed effects.  \n\nAn important question relevant for aggregate implications of our micro-level results is how powerful institutional investors “allocate” employment and payroll cuts across establishments of different sizes. One possibility is that powerful institutions prefer cutting both employment and payroll at larger establishments to reduce overall labor costs, which would imply a considerable aggregate effect of shareholder power both on employment and wages. Alternatively, powerful institutions might focus on cutting wages at larger establishments by exploiting their bargaining power while keeping their employment (perhaps because the larger establishments are more productive - see, e.g, Bento and Restuccia, 2017). This alternative scenario would imply that the negative effect of powerful shareholders on aggregate labor may be more pronounced for wages than employment. We explore these possibilities by re-estimating Eq. (2) with establishment observations weighted by their employment.1o  \n\nPanel C of Appendix Table A1 shows estimation results. We find that when establishments are weighted by size, the estimated relation between ownership of large institutions and employment growth is largely statistically insignificant and economically small (columns 1 through 4). In contrast, the presence of powerful institutional shareholders is associated with a significant reduction in establishment-level payroll growth (columns 5 to 8) and pay per employee growth (columns 9 to 12). For example, the coefficient on Top 5 ownersbip in column 6 is -0.075 and significant at a less than $1\\%$ level, comparable with an unweighted estimate for payroll growth in column 6 in Panel B (-0.079). The estimate in columns 10 suggests that, when top five institutional ownership increases by 10 percentage points, the growth rate of per-employee wages would decrease by $0.47\\%$  \n\nThese results, combined with the unweighted baseline results, describe how large institutional investors cut employment and wage bills across establishments: For larger establishments (which are likely more productive), they would push for a wage cut but not necessarily a cut in overall employment. For smaller establishments (which are likely less productive), they appear to push for reductions both in head counts and wages, representing an overall down-scale of labor. Importantly, the employment-weighted results suggest that the aggregate impact of the rise of large institutional shareholders on pay and the labor share of income may be negative. We investigate this question in Section 5.11  \n\n3.3. Identification — Difference-in-differences analysis of large increases in institutional ownership  \n\nOne concern with our empirical approach so far is that powerful institutional shareholders may “cherry pick” firms they invest in. In other words, it is not that powerful institutional shareholders lead to employment and payroll cuts, but rather that they tend to invest in firms with declining labor. To address this identification challenge, which is an instance of a standard selection (or reverse causality) concern, we employ a difference-indifferences (DD) approach that exploits “large” increases in institutional ownership. Specifically, we examine a sub-sample of establishments that experience an increase in block institutional ownership by $5\\%$ or more as our “treatment”? group. We then assemble a “control\" group of establishments that experience an increase of the same size in overall institutional ownership but not block institutional ownership.12  \n\nUsing these two groups, we estimate the following difference-in-differences equation: X  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{y}_{i j k t}=\\alpha_{i\\times T r e a t}+\\alpha_{k t}+\\sum_{\\tau=-5}^{-2}\\lambda_{\\tau}d[t+\\tau]_{j t}+\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{5}\\lambda_{\\tau}d[t+\\tau]_{j t}+\\sum_{\\tau=-5}^{-2}\\delta_{\\tau}d[t+\\tau]_{j t}}\\ &{~T r e a t_{j}+\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{5}\\delta_{\\tau}d[t+\\tau]_{j t}\\times T r e a t_{j}+\\gamma^{\\prime}X_{i t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i j k t},}\\end{array}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $a_{i}{\\times}T r e a t$ represents establishment-by-treatment indicator fixed effects and $d/t{+}\\tau J_{j t}$ is an indicator variable equal to one if year $t$ is $|\\tau|$ years ( $\\langle-5\\leq\\tau\\leq5\\rangle$ before or after a large increase in block or overall institutional ownership, and zero otherwise. “Year $\\mathrm{t}{-1}^{,}$ is the baseline year and thus $d[t-1]$ is equal to zero by construction. Treat is an indicator variable equal to one if establishments of firm j experience a more than $5\\%$ increase in block institutional ownership, and zero if a more than $5\\%$ increase in overall institutional ownership but not block institutional ownership. All other variables are defined as in Eq. (1).  \n\n[Insert Table 5 here.]  \n\nThe key identifying assumption for this design is that there is no differential trend between the treatment and control groups pre-event; but not necessarily that establishments are similar across the two groups. Even then, in Table 5 we first examine the characteristics of establishments that experience large increases in block institutional ownership one year before the event relative to those of establishments that experience a large increase in overall institutional ownership. The results indicate that the two groups are comparable along observable characteristics such as employment, firm and segment size, and age, showing no evidence of selection on these observables. However, the two groups differ in terms of the level of pre-event overall institutional ownership and total block ownership. Because these differences in the levels of institutional ownership may lead to a violation of the parallel-trend assumption, in a robustness analysis below we add to the DD specification controls for preevent overall institutional ownership and total block ownership as well as their respective interactions with the event-time indicators (see Abadie, 2005).  \n\nFigure 2 presents estimates of Eq. (3). The plotted estimates are for the DD estimator of Sun and Abraham (2021), which is robust to treatment effects heterogeneity. This estimator addresses the concern that standard two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences estimates can be biased because they do not aggregate the treatment effects with appropriate weights (see also Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiess, 2021). In our seting, the concern is mitigated because we do have never-treated observations in the control group. The estimates on $d[t+\\tau]\\times T r e a t$ for the pre-event period (i.e., $\\tau=-5$ through $^{-2}$ ) are statistically insignificant and economically small, pointing to no differential pre-trends between the two groups. The coefficients on $d[t+\\tau]$ $\\times$ Treat for the post-event period are all negative, indicating that establishments that experience a large increase in block institutional ownership undergo employment and payroll losses relative to plausibly comparable establishments that experience a large increase in overall but not block institutional ownership. The estimates are significant at the $10\\%$ level or less for $\\tau$ $=2$ and $\\tau\\geq4$ when log employment is the dependent variable, and for all $\\tau>0$ when $\\mathrm{log}$ payroll is the dependent variable.  \n\nImportantly, the economic magnitude of the estimates is comparable to that of the baseline estimates in Table 3. For example, the estimates for $d[t+2]\\times T r e a t$ are -0.022 and - 0.022 for log employment and payroll and the estimates for $d[t+5]\\times T r e a,$ t are -0.024 and - 0.026, which are similar to the magnitudes of the effect of the same relative change in block institutional ownership: relative to the control group, the treated group increases block institutional ownership by 13.2 percentage points $(=0.111-(-0.021))$ on average (Table 5), which in turn implies 0.020 $\\c^{\\prime}=-0.150\\times0.132$ )and 0.022 ( $\\c=-0.166\\times0.132$ ) declines in  \n\n# Panel A - Effect on log employment  \n\n![](images/6c4cb94f62c29e2ac5ed394e7930b668ee8016a88d57c3a44d89436d462ab5b7.jpg)  \nFigure 2: Difference-in-differences analysis. This figure plots the dynamic difference-in-differences DD) estimates of the effect of large institutional ownership on employment (Panel A) and payroll (Panel B) of establishments. The dependent variables are defined in Table 1 and the sample is as in Table 5. Detailed estimates are reported in Columns 5 and 6 in Panel A of Appendix Table A3. The markers on the bold lines in the figure show estimates for the DD specification of Sun and Abraham (2021), which is robust to treatment effects heterogeneity.The $90\\%$ confidence intervals are based on standard errors adjusted for sample clustering at the firm level.  \n\nemployment and total pay. Overall, the difference-in-differences results corroborate the validity of our baseline estimates and indicate that the baseline results are unlikely to be driven by selection of institutional shareholders into firms.  \n\nIn robustness analysis, we show that the estimates on $d[t+\\tau]\\times T r e a t$ for the post-event period remain large and significant when we use standard two-way fixed effects to estimate Eq. (3) with or without controls for pre-event overall institutional ownership and total block ownership and their respective interactions with the event-time indicators (Panel A of Appendix Table A3). We also show that average post-event coefficient estimates are statistically significant and of similar economic magnitudes (Panel B of Appendix Table A3).13  \n\n## 4. Mechanism  \n\nThe analysis so far shows a consistently negative within-establishment relation between powerful institutional ownership and labor outcomes. This section explores the mechanisms that underlie the baseline relation.  \n\n### 4.1. Bargaining power of employees — labor unions and labor market concentration  \n\nA plausible mechanism for powerful shareholders to affect the firm's labor force is through bargaining. To the extent that the firm and its employees jointly create rents that are to be shared, an increase in relative bargaining power of shareholders vis-a-vis employees would lead to smaller employment and payroll, as we show. Following the literature (e.g.. Matsa, 2010; and Benmelech, Bergman, and Kim, 2022), we measure employee bargaining power relative to shareholders using industry-level unionization rates and local labor marketlevel HHI of firm employment.14 We estimate the following regression that interacts measures of large institutional ownership with the two proxies for labor bargaining power in turn:  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{{\\bf y}_{i j k c t}=\\alpha_{i}+\\alpha_{k c t}+\\beta_{1}L a r g e I O_{j t-1}+\\beta_{2}L a r g e I O_{j t-1}\\times L a b o r B a r g a i n i n g_{k c t-1}}\\end{array}$ $+\\beta_{3}L a b o r B a r g a i n i n g_{k c t-1}+\\beta_{4}O v e r a l l I O_{j t-1}+\\gamma^{'}X_{i t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i j k c t},$  \n\nwhere Labor bargainingkt1 is the one-year lagged fraction of workers covered by collective bargaining in industry $k$ or the HHI of firm employment in industry $k$ and commuting zone 心 $a_{k\\,c t}$ is industry-by-commuting zone-by-year fixed effects, and all other variables are defined as in Eq. (1). The coefficient of interest is $\\beta_{2}$ which represents the interaction effect of large, powerful institutional ownership with labor bargaining power on establishment-level employment and payroll. Standard errors are clustered at the firm (and commuting zone) level when the measure of labor bargaining power is the fraction of workers covered by collctive bargaining (HHI of firm employment in the local labor market).  \n\n[Insert Table 6 here.]  \n\nTable 6 presents estimation results for Eq. (4) that uses industry union coverage rates (Panel A) and local labor market concentration (Panel B) as proxies for labor bargaining power. The negative coefficient on Top 1 ownersbip in column 1 of Panel A confirms the baseline result that within-establishment, an increase in the largest institutional ownership is associated with a significant employment reduction. Importantly, the significantly positive coefficient on Top 1 ownership $\\times$ Union (at the $1\\%$ level) in the column shows that high union coverage, which increases employee bargaining power, mitigates the negative effect of powerful institutional owners on employment. The estimates indicate that in industries where union coverage is zero, a ten-percentage point increase in the largest institutional ownership is associated with a $4.1\\%$ reduction in employment. However, in industries where collective bargaining coverage is oneSD above its mean $(=18.4\\%)$ , the same magnitude increase in top institutional ownership is related with a much smaller $0.7\\%$ reduction in employment. The estimates in column 5 show a very similar magnitude of the mitigating effect of labor unions on payroll reductions.  \n\nSimilarly, estimates in columns 2-3 and 6-7 show that the negative effects of top five institutions and total blockholder ownership are mitigated when labor unions provide stronger bargaining power to employees. Across the columns, the interaction effects of large shareholders’ ownership and union coverage rates are significant at the $1\\%$ to $5\\%$ levels. Columns 4 and 8 show that labor unions might also mitigate the effect of concentrated institutional ownership, although the estimated positive coefficients on HHI institutional ownersbip $\\times$ Union is insignificant at a conventional level. Taken together, the results in Panel A are consistent with higher collective bargaining coverage improving labor's bargaining power against shareholders, thereby mitigating the negative effect of large, powerful shareholders on the quantity of labor. A mutually non-exclusive explanation is that the (positive) effect of labor unions on employment and payroll (e.g, Freeman and Medoff, 1984) is more pronounced in the presence of powerful institutional shareholders.  \n\nFinally, the estimates in Panel B of Table 6 further corroborate the bargaining power interpretation of the baseline results. The coefficients on the interaction terms between large shareholder ownership and local labor market concentration are negative and generally statistically significant, indicating that powerful institutional shareholders have more negative effects on employment and payroll in more concentrated labor markets, in which firms presumably have greater bargaining power vis- $\\grave{\\cdot}\\grave{\\mathrm{a}}$ -visworkers.  \n\n### 4.2. Impact of powerful institutional investors on labor productivity and sharebolder value  \n\nWe further clarify the mechanism by examining the impact of powerful shareholders on firm-level labor productivity and shareholder returns per worker. If the employment and payroll losses are due to greater monitoring of managers and a reduction in their preference for quiet life, for example, then we would expect to see an improvement in overall labor efficiency as well. In contrast, bargaining and rent extraction would imply either no effect on productivity, if shareholder power simply reallocates cash flows away from workers, or even a loss in joint output and productivity, if the reallocation leads to inefficiencies such as loss of employee human capital or trust and morale (see Summers and Shleifer, 1988). To explore these predictions, we use information on firm revenues from the revenue-enhanced LBD (RE LBD) and estimate a variant of the baseline specification in Eq. (1) using firm-year observations from 1997 through 2015 with the log of revenues per employee as the dependent variable.15  \n\nFigure 3 shows a negative relation between labor productivity and all four measures of shareholder power. The coefficient estimates are significant at the $10\\%$ level or less for all proxies but the ownership HHI. The estimate for Total block ownersbip implies that, when a given establishment experiences a ten-percentage point increase in block institutional ownership, its labor productivity declines by $4.1\\%$ within one year. In Panel A2 of Appendix Table A5, we examine the dynamic relation in more detail and find that the labor productivity effect becomes economically smaller within two years and largely insignificant within three years. The negative short-run impact on labor productivity is more consistent with bargaining or rent-extraction than monitoring.  \n\nFurther supporting bargaining and conflicts of interests between powerful shareholders and workers, Figure 3 shows that there is a significantly positive relation between large shareholder ownership and shareholder returns per employee, defined as the change in log market value of equity per employee from Compustat, a measure of “shareholder value.\" Specifically, the figure shows a consistently positive relation between shareholder returns and the four measures of shareholder power, which is significant at the $10\\%$ level or less for all proxies. The relation with shareholder returns is also economically significant. For example, the estimate for Total block ownersbip implies that, when a given establishment experiences a ten-percentage point increase in block institutional ownership, its shareholder returns increase by $6.3\\%$ . Overall, the results in Figure 3 suggest that the negative effects of powerful institutional shareholders on labor are more likely due to conflicts of interest that lead to a redistribution of rents from workers to shareholders, rather than strict monitoring of management in terms of its relationship with employees.16  \n\n![](images/341eac922a6833e220d208fd5039ee49f9ad3458c26a8fe53f7cd0422950e388.jpg)  \nFigure 3: Mechanism - Impact on labor productivity and shareholder value. This figure plots estimates of the effect of large institutional owners on labor productivity and shareholder value. The dependent variable is the log of labor productivity, which is measured as revenue per employee from the revenue-enhanced LBD (red line, circle marker) and the logarithmic change in stock market value per employee, measured as the ratio of stock market capitalization to number of employees from Compustat (blue line, triangle marker). Variables for institutional ownership are lagged by one year. Detailed estimates are reported in Panel A1 of Appendix Table A5. The $90\\%$ confidence intervals are based on standard errors adjusted for sample clustering at the firm level.  \n\n### 4.3. Types of institutional sbarebolders  \n\nIn our final tests to probe the mechanism, we examine what types of institutional investors drive the relation between shareholder power and establishment-level labor outcomes. Specifically, we follow Bushee's (1998) classification of institutional ownership into “quasi-index,”“dedicated,” and “transient” types. In addition, we define “activist” institutional investors following Grennan (2019), who bases a classification on whether a given institution has engaged in shareholder activism campaigns.17 We then calculate the percentage of shares owned by each of the institutional investor types scaled by overall percentage institutional  \n\nOwnership. Thus, these measures capture the relative importance of specific institution types among all institutional investors? ownership for a given firm. We employ the measures in a variant of Eq. (1) in which the control for overall institutional ownership is dropped, given that the overall ownership is already controlled for by scaling the large institutional ownership Variables by it.  \n\nTable 7 presents estimation results. Columns 1 and 5 show that an increase in quasiindex ownership share among overall institutional ownership is associated with increases in establishment employment and payroll. Similarly, an increase in the share of transient institutional ownership is significantly associated with higher payroll (column 6), although its association with employment is insignificant (column 2). A plausible interpretation of the positive or insignificant relations is that quasi-index and transient funds are less likely to engage management relative to other types of institutions in the governance of labor.  \n\n[Insert Table 7 here.]  \n\nIn contrast, we find that the association between the relative ownership share of dedicated institutions, which have long-term investment horizons and stronger incentives to engage management (due to their concentrated holdings), and employment or payroll is significantly negative at the $1\\%$ level. The coefficients on Dedicated ownersbip/ Overall institutional ownersbip in columns 3 and 7 show that a ten-percentage point increase in the relative share of dedicated institutional ownership is associated with $0.6\\%$ reductions both in employment and payroll.  \n\nThe largest magnitude of the negative effect on labor comes from activist institutional investors. The coefficients on Activist ownership/ Overall institutional ownership in columns 4 (- 0.697) and 8 (-0.718) are significant at the $1\\%$ level. The estimates suggest that a ten-percentage point increase in activist institutional ownership shares among general institutional ownership would result in $6.7\\%$ to $6.9\\%$ reductions in establishment employment and payroll. This large, negative association between activist shareholders and employment and wage bills is consistent with evidence in Brav, Jiang, and Kim (2015), who focus on hedge fund activism events and manufacturing plants from 1994 to 2008.  \n\nOverall, the results in this section are consistent with dedicated (who hold concentrated ownership over a relatively long horizon) and activist institutions (who engage in shareholder activism campaigns) pushing for a reduction in labor in the interest of shareholder value. One way for activist (and dedicated) investors to affect firms’ labor is through intervention and public engagement with management. Panel B of Appendix Table A5 offers direct supporting evidence for this mechanism. We re-estimate our baseline specification in Eq. (1) at the firm level using an indicator for whether a firm becomes the target of a shareholder activism campaign in a given year as the dependent variable.18 The coefficient estimates are all positive and statistically significant across our four proxies, indicating that powerful shareholder-owned firms are more likely to be targets of activism campaigns.  \n\nIn addition, textual analysis of the announcements indicates that activism works through two main types of actions: formal proxy fights and shareholder proposals at annual meetings or soft engagement via public announcements in the press and newswires. We find that approximately three quarters of the target firms are involved in the former type of campaign, while about two thirds are involved in the latter. As for the stated objectives of the campaigns, about $45\\%$ of the campaigns involve firm operations, about $23\\%$ involve shareholder rights and maximizing shareholder value, and about $33\\%$ involve mergers and restructurings.  \n\nAnecdotal evidence also suggests that activist campaigns often directly target job cuts as important cost cutting measures to reduce operating expenses and boost shareholder value. For example, see “Canadian Pacific To Cut 4,500 Jobs,”\" The Wall Street Journal, December 12, 2012. After activist investor Bill Ackman won a proxy battle at Canadian Pacific, the railroad company decided to cut $23\\%$ of their workforce under its new chief executive Hunter Harrison who was appointed by Ackman. Similarly, on November 28, 2012, Icahn Capital LP announced its intention to discuss the operations and direction of Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and the company's plans to manage expenses and preserve value for shareholders. And on April 26, 2001, GAMCO Investors, Inc. announced that Mario Gabelli sent a letter to the board of directors of Carter-Wallace, Inc. expressing its views that restructuring of the business from an operational and financial point of view was needed.  \n\n## 5. Aggregate Implications  \n\nAs a first step toward examining the aggregate implications of our micro evidence, we perform a simple back-of-the-envelope counterfactual exercise to provide a first indication of how much of the time-series decline in labor income we can explain with rising shareholder power. Using the main estimates from Table 3 (Panel A, column 3), we calculate the implied time-series effect given the change in average block ownership from 1980 to 2014. The results shown in Figure 4 indicate that the rise in shareholder power explains about a 1.5 percentagepoint decline, which is roughly one-quarter of the overall decline in total wages and salaries relative to GDI.  \n\n![](images/9f9c3548c324101152f3e5c615460fa183d49737f7edb77224ff7f4b5e2e1e35.jpg)  \nFigure 4: Aggregate Implications, 1980-2014. This figure plots the ratio of total wage and salary accruals to domestic gross income (GDI) (blue solid line) and the counterfactual ratio of total wage and salary accruals to GDI (red dotted line) in the US for the period 1980-2014. The counterfactual ratio is constructed as the actual ratio minus the product of the estimated coefficient on block institutional ownership from Table 3 (Panel A, column 3, -0.166) times the change in average blockholder ownership in a given year relative to 1980. The compensation-to-GDI ratio is from the Federal Reserve Economic Data. Block institutional ownership is the percentage owned by institutional blockholders, defined as the institutional investors with more than $5\\%$ holdings as filed through Form 13D, 13F, or 13G. The average block ownership is calculated excluding firms in the agriculture, financial, utilities, and public administration sectors.  \n\nOf course, this graphical analysis is illustrative and subject to the concern that we extrapolate the estimate from micro data to make inference for the aggregate, which may not be valid if, for example, general or industry equilibrium effects lead to different estimates for the aggregates. Therefore, we next examine this possibility more closely using a more formal analysis of the aggregate implications. Specifically, we repeat the analysis of the effect of large institutional ownership on employment and payroll at the aggregate industry sector level. Following Autor et al. (2020), we aggregate at the following industry sectors: manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, and services.1 In addition to the log of employment and payroll, we also explore the implications for the labor share of income, defined as the ratio of payroll to revenues at the sector level.2° To preserve the full time-series, we retrieve firm-level revenues from Compustat.21  \n\n# [Insert Table 8 here.]  \n\nTable 8 shows sector-level estimation results using the top one and five as well as the block institutional ownership variables. Columns 1 to 3 present the within-sector relation between ownership of large institutional shareholders and the labor share of income, while columns 4 to 6 and 7 to 9 are for log employment and payroll, respectively. In line with the establishment-level estimates, the sector-level coefficient estimates are all negative and highly statistically significant in the majority of cases. To provide a comparative assessment of economic magnitudes, we calculate the implied change for a one-standard deviation (1-SD)  \n\nchange in the explanatory variable. For example, the unconditional within-sector standard deviation of the block ownership variable is $2.8\\%$ . Thus, the coefficient estimate on Total block ownersbip in column 9 implies that a 1-SD increase in block ownership in a given sector is associated with a $10.9\\%$ $(=\\exp(-4.107~\\times~0.028)-1)$ decline in the sector's payroll. The corresponding coefficients at the establishment and firm level in column 3 in Table 3 (Panel A) and column 7 in Appendix Table A1 (Panel A), respectively, show similarly sizeable though a bit smaller economic magnitudes. In response to a 1-SD increase in block ownership, the implied within-establishment decline in payroll is by $2.4\\%$ $(=\\exp(-0.166\\times0.145)-1)$ and the implied within-firm decline in payroll is by $6.6\\%$ $(=\\exp(-0.474\\times0.145)-1)$ . Thus, the aggregate analysis further strengthens the material labor impact of rising shareholder power.  \n\nWe now turn to the implications for the labor share. Between 1981 and 2015, the sector-level labor share declined by 6.8 percentage points on average, which is comparable to the aggregate time-series decline in Figure 4. Over the same period, the sector-level block institutional ownership increased, on average, by 8.9 percentage points. Thus, the coefficient estimate in column 3 in Table 8 (-0.215) implies that the sector-level change in the labor share that can be atributed to the increase in block institutional ownership is -1.9 percentage points $(=-0.215\\times0.089)$ , which is comparable to our earlier back-of-the-envelope estimate in Figure 4 and corresponds to over one-quarter of the overall average decline of the labor share in the aggregated sector sample. These results suggest that shareholder power can explain part of the aggregate decline of payroll relative to measures of output.  \n\nIn Appendix Table A6, we provide additional estimates to clarify the intuition of the aggregate results for the labor share. First, a negative relation between large institutional ownership and the labor share may appear inconsistent with our earlier finding of a negative relation with labor productivity (Figure 3), as the labor share and labor productivity are inversely related. However, the key difference between the two results lies in aggregation. Panel A of Appendix Table A6 shows that, when we run the analysis of the firm-level labor share by weighting the observations using firm revenues (columns 1-3), the relation with the large institutional ownership variables becomes negative (albeit insignificant). Second, the negative relation between sector-level large shareholder ownership and the labor share is consistent with our earlier finding of a significant negative relation with the growth rate of wages per employee in employment-weighted regressions (see Appendix Table A1, Panel A), suggesting that cuts in wage rates are an important margin for larger firms. Because these firms represent a disproportionate share of aggregate revenues, they also drive the negative relation with the labor share in the aggregate.  \n\nTo further examine the notion that aggregation drives the sector-level result, we decompose the overall effect on the labor share by margin using the decomposition approach of Melitz and Polanec (2015) and Autor et al. (2020). First, we show that the sector-level implications for the labor share are robust to using a specification that uses first differences instead of levels (Panel B of Appendix Table A6). Importantly, in Panels C and D we find that for most specifications the reallocation component, which captures the effect of (changes in) value-weighting, contributes to the overall effect on the sector-level labor share by as much or more than the unweighted component.2  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nLabor markets in the US have experienced a pronounced transformation over the last decades, with labor income stagnating despite strong productivity and profit growth. This paper sets forth an explanation based on the ownership structure of public firms. Motivated by the classical agency theory of the firm based on conflicts of interests between shareholders and stakeholders, we conjecture that increases in the concentration of more powerful institutional shareholders reduce employment and labor income, because the objectives and interests of the shareholders more likely conflict with those of the workers. Using confidential establishment-level data from the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Business Database from 1982-2015, we provide comprehensive evidence that supports this explanation. Increases in concentration of institutional ownership lower establishment employment and payroll, while raising shareholder value without apparent increases in labor productivity. Overall, these findings suggest employment policies aimed at reforming shareholder capitalism by broadening the objective of the firm beyond the more narrow maximization of shareholder value, such as increasing labor representation on boards or allowing for labor participation in firm governance, may help to raise employment and wages. Future research should examine the impact of concentrated institutional ownership and policies affecting governance on the outcomes of different type of workers.  \n\n# References  \n\nAbadie, Aiberto, ZUU5, \"Semiparametric Difference-in-Differences Estimators, Keview Of Economic Studies 72(1), 1-19.   \nAcemoglu, Daron, 2002, “Technical Change, Inequality, and the Labor Market,\" Journal of Economic Literature 40(1), 7-72.   \nAcemoglu, Daron, David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon H.

Panels A and B presents for the full and manufacturing samples, respectively. We require each observation in the sample to be present at least two consecutive years. “\"Total employment\" is the number of total employees; “\"Total payroll is the total payroll in thousand dollars; “Average wage” is computed as total payroll divided by total employment (in thousand dollars); “Establishments per segment'’ is the number of establishments in a given three-digit SIC industry segment of a given firm; “Establishments per firm”' is the total number of establishments of a given firm; μ“Establishments age” is the number of years since a plant's birth, which is proxied either by the flag for establishments birth in the LBD or by its first appearance in the LBD, whichever is earliest; μ“Employment (payroll) growth rate”\" is the change in employment (payroll) scaled by sum of current and lagged employment (payrol). The institutional holdings data are obtained from Thomson-Reuters 13F SEC filings. The ownership variables are defined as the percentage of shares outstanding owned by a given type of institutional investors: “Overall institutional ownership” is the percentage owned by all institutional investors; “\"Top 1 ownership” and “Top 5 ownership” are the percentage owned by the largest and largest five institutional investors, respectively; “Total block ownership” is the percentage owned by blockholders, which are defined as the institutional investors with more than $5\\%$ holdings as filed through Form 13D, 13F, or 13G; “HHI institutional ownership” is the ownership concentration Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, which approaches zero when the firm is owned by a large number of institutional investors of relatively equal size and reaches its maximum of one when it is controlled by a single large institutional investor; “Quasi-index Ownership/overall inst. ownership, “Dedicated ownership/overall inst. ownership” and Transient ownership/overall inst. ownership” are the percentage owned by quasi-index, dedicated, and transient institutional investors as classified by Bushee (1998), scaled by overall institutional ownership; “Activist Ownership/overall inst. ownership?” is the percentages owned by activist institutional investors as classified by Grennan (2019) based on institutions who have engaged in shareholder activism campaigns, scaled by overallinstitutional ownership. “Union coverage” is the industry-level percentage of the workforce covered by collective bargaining collected from the CPS.

In Panel A, we repeat the baseline analysis afer excluding firms that eventually undergo bankruptcy or are involved in acquisitions. The information on bankruptcies and acquisitions is from the Compustat delisting reason variable (DLRSN). The specification and variable definitions are otherwise the same as in the baseline. In Panel B, we repeat the analysis using a firm-level layoff indicator as the dependent variable (Columns 1 to 4). The information on layoffs announcements is from two data sources: the press, which we hand-collect from the Wall Street Journal and other major news sources using Factiva and LexisNexis news searches, and Capital IQ's Key Development database (see Falato and Liang (2016) for additional details). Combining these two sources leads to an incidence of layoff announcements of about $8.5\\%$ of the firm-year bervations.We also perform textual analysis of the news rleases togather more granular information on whether the layoff is motivated by cost-cutting reasons, whose incidence is about $2.6\\%$ of the firm-year observations (Columns 5 to 8). Finally, we also use downsizing announcements from Capital IQ's Key Development database, whose incidence is about $12\\%$ of the firm-year observations (Columns 9 to 12).

We also report estimates using the alternative DD estimator of Sun and Abraham (2021) which is robust to treatment effects heterogeneity (Columns 5 and 6). Panel B shows results for a specification that replaces the dynamic event-time indicators for the years after the event with an “After” indicator, and omits the other event-time indicators. Estimates for the specification without controls for preevent Overall IO and Block IO as well as their respective interactions with the “After’ indicator are in Columns 1 and 2 and estimates for the specification that adds those controls are in Columns 3 and 4.

    "reference_markdown": "# Syndication of Venture Capital Investment: The Art of Resource Pooling  \n\nMichel Ferrary  \n\nThis article explores the rationale of syndications of institutional venture capital investors when they fund start-ups. There is an implicit labor division between institutional venture capital investors in which pure venture capital firms are in charge of converting investment uncertainty into risk by funding the seed stage of start-ups. The other investors invest in the following stages to sustain the start-ups' development. Relationships between investors are also handled following informal rules. Exchanges between institutional venture capital investors are based on a reciprocity that follows the informal principles of the gift exchange theory.  \n\n## Introduction  \n\nAccording to the Small Business Administration, every year, more than 600,000 new enterprises are created in the United States (612,296 in 2003; 628,917 in 2004; and 644,122 in 2005). The funding of the creation of these enterprises depends on a large variety of sources: self-financing, family, friends (known as “Business Angels\"), wealthy individuals, commercial banks, the Small Business Administration, and/or institutional venture capital (VC) investors. The institutional VC investors fund a very limited number of new enterprises at their seed stage. According to the VentureOne database of Dow Jones, institutional VC investors funded the creation of 203 start-ups in 2003, 210 in 2004, and 240 in 2005. Some features of the VC industry such as the size of VC funds and the obligation to return the money to their investors after 10 years limit the capability of VC firms to invest in seed stages of start-ups and lead them to prefer later stages. However, sometimes, VC firms invest in seed stages, and some of the largest American firms, especially in the high-tech industry, have obtained funding from these types of investors to support their start-ups. For example, companies such as Adobe, AMD, Intel, Cisco Systems, Electronic Arts, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo!, and Google raised funding at their seed stage from VC firms. Start-ups funded by institutional VC investors usually have a faster growing business (Hellman & Puri, 2002), create numerous jobs, and have an important impact on the business environment. These facts justify research on the VC industry even if VC firms only represent a limited source of funding at the seed stage of start-ups. This study focuses on the investing behavior of institutional VC firms and their relationships with the start-ups they backed. This research does not deal with individual investors (\"Business Angels\"). Similar to Gompers and Lerner (2001), I acknowledge the existence of “Business Angels\" in the funding of start-ups, but I will not consider them in this research.  \n\nInstitutional VC investors focus on a very specific kind of start-up. They look for new enterprises that need a large amount of investment and that represent a potentially high growth business. A VC firm is a pool of capital organized as a limited partnership investing in nonpublic companies that present an opportunity for high rates of return within 5 to 7 years (Gompers & Lerner, 2004). Four different stages of development describe the evolution of start-up maturity: the seed stage, the early stage, the expansion stage, and the later stage. These stages can be supported by institutional VC investors through several rounds of funding. Occasionally, these investors are involved in seed stages to fund the creation and development of start-ups (Hellman & Puri, 2ooo; Kozmetsky, Gill, & Smilor, 1984; Perez, 1987). They may invest before there is a real product or company organized (so called “seed investing\") or may provide capital to start-up a company in its first or second stage of development (known as “early stage investing\"). A VC firm may also provide needed financing to help a company grow beyond a critical mass to become more successful (\\*expansion stage financing\"). The VC firm may invest in a company throughout the company's life cycle, and some funds invest more in seed stages and others more in later stages (National Venture Capital Association, 2005, p. 87).  \n\nInstitutional VC investors do not invest in start-ups in a single round but through several rounds. According to tournament analysis (Aoki, 1999), for each round, an investor has the choice between stopping investment if the start-up's failure is anticipated and participating in the next round if potential success is still in the cards.  \n\nGenerally, investors do not invest alone. They syndicate the funding of companies. A syndicate is run by a “lead\" investor who obtains the “informal privilege” of inviting other investors: the “passive” investors (De Clercq & Dimov, 2004; Lerner, 1994; Manigart et al., 2006). The lead investor originates the first round of funding and creates the syndicate by inviting other investors to this and/or to subsequent rounds. Invited investors might refuse the invitation if they are not interested in the start-up. Gorman and Sahlman (1989) mentioned that lead investors typically hold equity-linked claims, and many initial agreements give them preemptive rights and rights of first refusal in future financing rounds. The lead position of the first investor is due to an informal rule inside the VC community. The lead investor develops social ties with the entrepreneur prior to investment. After closing the funding, he or she becomes strongly involved in the management of the start-up (Brander, Amit, & Antweiler, 2002; Hellman & Puri, 2002; Hsu, 2004; Lerner, 1995; Sapienza, 1992). Generally, he or she is on the board of directors of the invested company. On the other hand, “passive” investors are not really involved in the operational management of the start-up. They_ do not have strong social ties with the entrepreneur and seldom sit on their board of directors. VC investors can be lead or passive investors depending on whether or not they have originated the deal.  \n\nThere is a theoretical issue to understand the rationale of these syndications. Why do institutional VC investors syndicate their investments? A syndication can be understood as a kind of alliance in which two or more investors come together to take an equity stake in a company (Wright & Lockett, 2003). Different hypotheses have been explored. Syndications have been understood as a means to diversify risk (Bygrave, 1987; Bygrave & Timmons, 1992; Lerner, 1994; Manigart et al., 2006), to improve projects selection (Brander et al., 2002; De Clercq & Dimov, 2004; Lerner; Manigart et al.), to mobilize competencies (Brander et al.; De Clercq & Dimov; Hochberg, Ljungqvist, & Lu, 2007; Manigart et al.), and to gain access to deal flow (Manigart et al.).  \n\nThis research explores the hypothesis that VC syndications are also used by institutional VC investors to pool useful resources for the development of invested start-ups.  \n\nThis perspective mobilizes the resource-based theory (Barney, 1991; Penrose, 1959; Rumelt, 1991). A resource-based understanding of strategic networks may highlight the nature of alliances that VC firms nurture with partners that own complementary resources to sustain the creation and business development of a funded company. In this perspective, a syndicate can be understood as a formal contract linking interdependent firms that have complementary resources to sustain the funded start-up. A major issue for VC firms is to acquire resources to sustain the start-ups they have funded, and to find an exit strategy by selling their investments on financial markets through initial public offerings (IPO) or to a large company or a private equity firm. From 2000 to 2005, 1948 venture-backed companies were merged or acquired, and 307 became public.  \n\nGenerally, institutional VC investors are implicitly understood as a homogeneous population with a common status and common goals. In fact, it is an important point for this research that institutional investors involved in VC syndicates constitute a heterogeneous population. According to the National Venture Capital Association and Galante's Venture Capital and Private Equity Directory published by Dow Jones, four categories of institutional investors can be identified. The first category is made up of pure VC firms (Sequoia Capital; Kleiner, Perkins Caufield & Byers; Mayfield Fund, etc.). Among institutional VC investors, this category is the only one entirely dedicated to VC investment. For the other institutional investors, VC investments only represent a small part of their activities. The second category is composed of private equity firms (Bain Capital, Blackstone, etc.). The third category is made up of large industrial companies that practice corporate VC (Cisco Systems, Lucent Technologies, ATT, Siemens, etc.). The fourth category is made up of investment banks (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse First Boston, etc.).  \n\nThe diversity of investors reflects an implicit division of labor between the different institutional VC investors involved in syndications. When they invest in seed stages, pure VC firms do the screening of projects and other investors later participate in further stages to bring the resources needed for further start-up development. The diversity and complementarity of the various investors necessarily induce interdependency and lead to exchanges among them.  \n\nThe analysis of the VC industry developed in this research highlights different points. First, the funding of the seed stage induces a specific kind of evaluation. Further, in this article, based on Knight's (1921) distinction between uncertainty and risk, I argue that investors evaluate more uncertainty than risk when they invest at the seed stage. When an investor evaluates a start-up at its seed stage, the latter does not have any clients or products, and sometimes, it does not even exist. A financial analyst does not have explicit information to make his or her investment decision, for example for other kinds of assets. Granovetter (1985, 2005) and Podolny (1994) emphasize the importance of social networks to handle risk in economic exchanges. Based on this perspective, I argue that to handle uncertainty, VC investors use social networks to gather tacit knowledge on the entrepreneur and his or her project before investing. The funding of the seed stage is used as a “learning by collaborating” situation in which investors collect knowledge in order to convert uncertainty on start-ups into risk. Investors progressively convert uncertainty into risk by creating and gathering more explicit and formal information. Second, there is a labor division among institutional VC investors. Investments in seed stages carried out by institutional VC investors are mainly performed by pure VC firms that are specialized in uncertainty management. Third, in order to sustain invested start-ups and implement their exit strategy, pure VC firms develop ties with investment banks, private equity firms, and large industrial companies by inviting them into syndications. Lead investors use syndications to pool resources. On the other hand, by participating in syndicates, large companies have access to private information on innovation in their technological and business fields. This is consistent with an acquisitive strategy of start-ups in order to improve the technology portfolio of large industrial firms (Dushnitsky & Lenox, 2005; Keil, 2004). Investment banks use their VC investments in order to be linked with start-ups that will go public or be acquired by large industrial companies. They do this in order to get the mandate to take the company public or to organize its acquisition. Investment banks make business by organizing these financial operations. Private equity firms look for potentially profitable companies generating revenues that can be acquired through leverage buyout operations in order to resell them when profitability has been restored and debts reimbursed.  \n\nThe article is organized as follows. First, based on Knight's (1921) definition of uncertainty, I explore why the seed stage is more about uncertainty management than risk management and argue that pure VC firms are the main institutional investors of seed stages because they have the specific competency to convert uncertainty into risk. Second, I describe how pure VC firms use their informal right as primary investor to invite other investors in order to pool resources to sustain invested start-ups. Finally, another theoretical issue is explored to define the rationale of exchanges between investors. The gift exchange theory defined by the anthropologist Marcel Mauss (1923) is mobilized to understand informal and delayed exchanges between institutional investors involved in VC syndications.  \n\n## Theory and Hypothesis  \n\n### The Conversion by Pure VC Firms of Uncertainty into Risk Through the Funding of the Seed Stage  \n\nA resource-based understanding of syndication is based on the heterogeneity and the interdependence of institutional VC investors involved in syndications. The interdependence of the four types of investors, namely VC firms, private equity firms, investment banks, and corporate VC units of large industrial firms, is due to their common interest in the creation and development of start-ups and also to their complementary contributions to the start-up life cycle. In this cycle, pure VC firms hold a specific function because they initiate that cycle by being strongly involved in the funding of the seed stage dedicated to the company's creation.  \n\nThe specificity of pure VC activity is mainly linked to the funding of the seed stage. The main screening of potential investments is accomplished before the first round of funding. Of the 500 or so proposed ventures that a VC firm may review each year, about $90\\%$ are rejected during the initial screening before the first investment. Of the remaining $10\\%$ considered good enough for detailed analysis, only five or six can be financed and managed by each representative venture firm at any one time since the costs of analysis and of management are high (Gompers & Lerner, 2004; Perez, 1987) (Figure 1).  \n\nI argue that when a venture capitalist funds the seed stage of a new enterprise, he or she does not undertake risk management but uncertainty management. This statement is  \n\nFigure 1  \n\nFunding and Life Cycle of Start-Ups Based on Perez (1987) and Hochberg et al. (2007)  \n\n![](images/f6a676faaf4be4fd872c9f29527ccc8b0e17e3023820c35c9d007aa236fbd35d.jpg)  \n\nbased on Knight's definition of uncertainty (Knight, 1921, p. 233). Knight draws a distinction between measurable uncertainty and uncertainty that is unmeasurable. He uses the term “risk' to designate the former and the term “uncertainty” for the latter. The practical difference between the two categories risk and uncertainty is that in the former, the distribution of the outcome in a group of instances is known (either through calculation a priori or from statistics of past experience). In the case of uncertainty, this is not true. The reason is generally that it is impossible to form a group of instances, because the situation dealt with is highly unique.  \n\nInvestments in seed stages do not square with a situation of risk but with a situation of uncertainty because of the uniqueness of each invested company. At the seed stage, investors have to evaluate four categories of uncertainty in their decision-making process: managerial uncertainty (the quality of founders), product uncertainty (the quality of the product), market uncertainty (the reality of the market), and financial uncertainty (the capability of the start-up to generate enough cash flow to remain solvent). The combination of these dimensions of uncertainty progressively evolves to become risk as the invested company matures. Before funding the seed stage, there is no public information, track record, or tangible asset to evaluate the new company. Often, the company does not have any clients, and sometimes it does not exist yet as a legal entity. For this reason, VC investments differ in several important aspects from other financial assets (Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984). First, VC is usually invested in new firms that have very little performance history. As a result, the investor cannot rely on historical performance data, as he or she can in the case of the stock market (Alexander, Sharpe, & Bailey, 2000). Second, the investment is typically in small firms, and the nature of the relationship between investors and entrepreneurs supposes a higher degree of direct involvement compared with the relatively inactive role of investors in publicly traded companies (Kaplan & Stromberg, 2004). Third, VC investments are illiquid in the short term because of the lack of efficient capital markets for equity shares of privately held companies. Long horizons of product and market development make valuation difficult. Moreover, the legal restrictions that apply to the resale of such investments lock the investor in for a certain period (Friedman, 1990). It is important to consider the effects of the massive uncertainty that typically accompanies new ventures. This uncertainty makes it very difficult for agents to construct precise probabilistic models, especially if they are “boundedly rational,” i.e., have limited processing powers (Admati & Pfeiderer, 1994). For these reasons, at the seed stage, investments in new start-ups involve unmeasurable uncertainty. Therefore, in the decisionmaking process to invest at the seed stage, VC firms practice uncertainty management and not risk management.  \n\nUncertainty management is based on tacit knowledge. Polanyi (1966) classified human knowledge into two categories. “Explicit’ or codified knowledge refers to knowledge that is transmittable in formal and systematic language. On the other hand, “tacit\" knowledge has a personal quality, which makes it hard to formalize and communicate. Tacit knowledge is deeply rooted in action, commitment, and involvement in a specific context. Tacit knowledge is a continuous activity of knowing and embodies what Bateson (1973) has referred to as an, “analogue” quality. In this context, communication between individuals may be seen as an analog process that aims to share tacit knowledge to build mutual understanding. By contrast, explicit knowledge is discrete or “digital.\" It is captured in records of the past such as libraries, archives, and databases and is assessed on a sequential basis (Nonaka, 1994).  \n\nRisk management is about evaluation based on explicit and existing knowledge. Uncertainty management is about creating the knowledge needed for the evaluation. Knowledge is created through social interactions between individuals (Nonaka, 1994). Social ties and embeddedness are essential for collecting information because the evaluation of uncertainty is based on tacit knowledge. In order to reduce uncertainty, an investor in VC cannot rely on tangible information. He or she has to rely mainly on a subjective assessment procedure based upon the business plan presented by the entrepreneur and on its social interactions.  \n\nSeveral scholars in economic sociology emphasize that social networks are efficient for reducing uncertainty before VC investments (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001). Business evaluation of companies, especially new businesses, is an archetypal situation where social networks are a more efficient way to get information than from the market. This is consistent with Granovetter's conclusion (2005, p. 33) “social networks affect the fow and the quality of information. Much information is subtle, nuanced and diffcult to verify, so actors do not believe impersonal sources and instead rely on people they know.\" Several studies on banking activities have shown the use of social networks in the evaluation of business carried out by bankers (Ferrary, 2003a; Nohria & Eccles, 1992; Uzzi, 1999). Investors nurture social embeddedness with potential entrepreneurs and their business environment because VC activity is an uncertain investment. When there is an opportunity for investment, a VC does not consult other VCs to get information but people outside the VC community who have information on the entrepreneur, on cutting edge new technologies, and on potential markets. This “due diligence” process supposes a high level of embeddedness because social networks are the main pipe of tacit knowledge. No market exists to get information for evaluating a start-up project. The VC creates a strong tie with the entrepreneur by meeting him or her regularly on a professional and personal basis to get tacit knowledge. There is an asymmetry of information between the entrepreneur and the VC investor that the latter tries to reduce by collecting data. As mentioned by Gompers and Lerner (2004, p. 129), there is a “lemon” problem. The investor may choose not to invest if he or she does not have enough information. In the first round, the entrepreneur does not have any interest in hiding too much information if he or she wants to secure a follow-up funding. $E x$ ante, the entrepreneur might hide information to get his/her first round of funding, but the investor will not invest in following rounds if ex post, he or she discovers hidden information. In the first round, the entrepreneur does not have interest in taking advantage of an asymmetry of information. If he or she wants to be funded, he or she has to reveal as much information as he or she can in order to solve the \"lemon” problem and secure future funding. As this information is intangible, he or she can reveal it only through informal social exchanges. There is a social tie constraint to share information.  \n\nVC firms really deal with the high level of uncertainty at the seed stage. At this stage, they need to develop strong personal ties with the entrepreneur and be embedded in local social networks to evaluate an investment opportunity efficiently. A venture capitalist uses his or her social network to get information on entrepreneurs (friends, family, former coworkers, etc.) and a network of experts to evaluate the opportunity of the market and the product.  \n\nThe level of embeddedness determines the quality of the evaluation because social ties give access to more information through informal relationships than through purely formal ones. VCs collect tacit knowledge mainly about the entrepreneur, who is the main factor of uncertainty. Information about personality, intellectual honesty, and managerial capabilities matters in the decision when a start-up is at the seed stage. These factors are not tangible data but tacit knowledge that can only be gathered through informal relations with the potential entrepreneur and his or her social network. The more intangible the information is, the more the redundancy of strong ties is used to validate it. The evaluation results from a combination of intangible information checked several times through redundancy of strong ties. Conversely, the more tangible the information, the less need there is for validation through strong ties.  \n\nNevertheless, even after doing due diligence and closing a round of funding at the seed stage, the investor still faces a high level of uncertainty about the entrepreneur, the market, and the product. Ex ante, there is no real information on the market, the technology, and the entrepreneur because often, the company does not yet exist. Even if the venture capitalist has personal ties with the entrepreneur, he or she does not know him or her “as an entrepreneur.\"  \n\nThe venture capitalist will collect more information through the creation and the development of the company. There is a “learning by collaborating” process that begins as soon as the entrepreneur uses the raised funding and the venture capitalist gets involved in the operational management of the company. The first round of funding of a seed stage is a \"learning by collaborating” period that reduces the information asymmetry between the investor and the entrepreneur. With a VC investment comes a term sheet that sets up milestones that condition the funding and defines the role of investors in the management of the start-up. According to Gompers and Lerner (2004, p. 130), the lead venture capitalist visits the entrepreneur once a month on average and spends 4 to 5 hours at the facility during each visit. One can use a two-period agency model to describe the learning process that takes place between the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist in the first round of funding of a seed stage (Chan, Siegel, & Thakor, 1990). In the first period, this learning process changes the information structure of agents and modifies the risk evaluation before the second period. Before the first round of funding of the seed stage, there is an asymmetry of information between the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist. This asymmetry can qualify as adverse selection because there is uncertainty about the competitiveness of the product and the reality of the market. This uncertainty can also qualify as moral hazard if for the venture capitalist, there is uncertainty about the personality of the entrepreneur (honesty, managerial competencies, technical skills) (Kaplan & Stromberg, 2004).  \n\nInvestors voluntarily socialize their professional relationships with entrepreneurs in order to create the tacit knowledge they need to evaluate more deeply the investment opportunity. The round of funding of the seed stage can be understood as a legal device to formalize an implicit obligation of socialization. This funding is not only a financial investment but it also induces more social interaction, especially for the lead investor who is strongly involved in monitoring the invested company. Gompers (1995, p. 302) mentions that, “Venture capitalists are understood to provide intensive oversight of the firms in their portfolios. Their involvement includes service on the boards of firms in their portfolios, frequent informal visits, meetings with customers and suppliers, and active involvement in key personnel and strategic decisions.\" Other scholars underscore the involvement of VC firms in the management of start-ups (Gorman & Sahlman, 1989; Hellman & Puri, 2002; Wijbenga, Postma, & Stratling, 2007). This monitoring creates a strong tie between the lead investor and the entrepreneur. Due to the contract, and because he or she is a shareholder, the VC can meet the entrepreneur frequently. The lead investor is on the board of directors, and so, he or she meets the entrepreneur at least once a month. In some special cases, such as top managers recruitments, negotiations on partnerships, or business crises, the lead venture capitalist might be, for a short period of time, in touch with the entrepreneur every day (Gompers & Lerner, 2004, p. 255). For example, P. Lamont, a Sequoia Partner, mentions that for a while, he was involved in the management of Cisco every day when his VC firm funded this start-up. The highest level of involvement is when the venture capitalist accommodates the start-up in his or her own office. For example, Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers, one of the most prominent VC firm in Silicon Valley, has an “Entrepreneur in Residence” program to accommodate and support fledgling start-ups. These cases of daily interactions contribute to create strong ties between entrepreneurs and investors.  \n\nBehind the formal legal contract through which the VC firm funds a company, there is an implicit contract that involves the venture capitalist in the management of the company and initiates frequent social interactions between the entrepreneur and the investor. In order to reduce uncertainty, the round of funding of the seed stage appears as a legal device to initiate an interpersonal learning process between the entrepreneur and the investor. With this round, the VC gives enough money to start the company and initiate the learning-by-doing collaborative process, but not enough to finance the company until it becomes viable and self-sufficient.  \n\nAt the end of the seed stage round of funding, the uncertainty has changed into risk. At this point, the investor has more tangible information on the management team, a product exists, some clients have been approached, and the company has a track record (burning rate of cash, respect of milestones, etc.). Explicit knowledge is created as the new company becomes more mature. Thus, the evaluation to fund subsequent stages is based on more explicit information accumulated through the funding of the seed stage. The rate of bankruptcy is higher at the seed stage than in following stages because of the high uncertainty. Hochberg et al. (2007) pointed out that around one-third of companies do not survive beyond the first round of funding and that the survival probability increases in the following stages.  \n\nThe funding of the seed stage deals with uncertainty management, while the funding of the other stages (early, expansion, and later) are more about risk management. Sometimes, the distinction between uncertainty management and risk management can induce a difference in the legal contract of funding of the seed stage. It is commonly admitted that investors get shares in return for their funding. This is generally true, except in some cases at the seed stage when uncertainty is too important. As explained by Alain Azan, a partner of Sofinova Ventures (a VC firm in Silicon Valley), on some occasions, at the seed stage, when the uncertainty is too high, investors can receive “convertible notes” instead of shares for the first round of funding. The notes will be converted into shares at the second round of funding based on the valuation carried out by the second round investors. In the first round of funding, an investor lends money to the entrepreneur with the right to convert the loan into shares later. The valuation of the convertibility is unknown when this first round of funding is closed. Yet, the legal contract specifies that the convertibility of the loan will be $20\\%$ higher than the price that would be paid by the second round investors.2 In this case, investors get shares when they fund the second and following stages. The price they get for these shares is used to calculate the value of shares that primary investors will get in the conversion of their “convertible notes\" at the second round. This practice is due to the fact that in some cases, at the first round of funding of a seed stage, neither entrepreneurs nor investors know the value of the new enterprise, which as of yet, has no clients and products. This squares with a situation of high uncertainty. At this stage, neither entrepreneurs nor investors know how many shares should be given in exchange for the funding raised to launch the company. Conversely, both know that they will have more tangible information at the end of the first round. Tangible information will be available for the second round negotiations and investors will be able to calculate a valuation of the start-up. This valuation is used to calculate the conversion of the “convertible notes\"” that funded the seed stage. This exceptional use of “convertible notes” allows funding of start-ups in situations when high uncertainty does not make the valuation of a new enterprise possible. Following rounds of funding are more a situation of risk, and investors can valuate the company.  \n\nDifferent factors can explain the limited number of VC investors in syndications funding seed stages. Some are related to features of the VC industry. The size of VC funds and the obligation to return the money to their investors after 10 years limit the capability of VC firms to invest at this stage. Also, at the seed stage, start-ups do not need a large amount of money, which would imply a larger number of investors. It also can be argued that socialization of investors with entrepreneurs infuences the size of syndications. The learning-by-collaborating process to convert uncertainty into risk is highly timeconsuming for investors and entrepreneurs. Socialization induces investments in time and in informal relationships. The creation of strong ties to manage uncertainty is timeconsuming for entrepreneurs and investors and because tacit information cannot be easily shared, only very few investors (sometimes, even only one) can create this strong tie. Thus, one expects that just one or a very few institutional investors participate to the funding of the seed stage. Considering these features, one can expect that:  \n\nHypothesis 1: At the seed stage, the number of institutional investors in syndicates islow.  \n\nInstitutional VC investors are a heterogeneous community. They are composed of pure VC firms, investment banks, corporate VC units of large industrial firms, and private equity firms. The specific competence of pure VC firms is to deal with uncertainty and transform this into risk through the funding of a seed stage. To be more precise, it should be mentioned that among pure VC firms, only a limited number of them frequently invest at the seed stage and that a large part prefer to invest in the following stages. It is difficult to clearly separate the two categories, partly because the distinction is not systematically made and partly because investment strategies of VC firms can change over time depending on the size and the maturity of their fund.  \n\nPure VC firms are socially embedded in innovative regions and develop local ties (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001). They are able to collect tacit knowledge that other kinds of investors cannot get because they are not settled in each innovative region (for example, private equity firms are mainly located in New York City and the Boston region). Investments at the seed stage are mainly performed by pure VC firms. This means that this kind of investor initiates the funding of start-ups and obtains the lead investor's privilege of inviting other investors into their syndications. Thus, the lead investor who organized the funding of the seed stage gets valuable private information that highly interests the other categories of investors (large industrial companies, investment banks, and private equity firms) who do not however invest in seed stages.  \n\nOnly a small proportion of institutional VC investors invest in seed stages, and they are mainly pure VC firms. This reduces the availability of VC investors to find peers in order to syndicate and leads pure VC firms to mainly syndicate with other pure VC firms when they do so (Lerner, 1994; Podolny, 1993).  \n\nAccording to the labor division, among the four categories of investors in which pure VC firms convert uncertainty into risk by becoming an insider investor through the learning-by-collaborating process originated by the funding of the seed stage, it can be expected that:  \n\nHypothesis 2: Pure VC firms are overrepresented in syndication at seed stages funding.  \n\n### Pooling Resources by Syndicating VC Investments  \n\nImplicitly, by investing in a seed stage, an investor pays to become an inside investor and thus obtains valuable private information to exchange with other investors in order to get something in return. He or she also pays to get the informal privilege granted to the lead investor to invite in other investors.  \n\nBefore closing the funding of the seed stage, none of the members of the investor community has an inside understanding of any given new company. There is information asymmetry between the entrepreneur and the investor community. The situation is completely different at the end of the first round of funding, when the start-up company has used the money raised and is looking to raise a second round to fund its growth. The investor who originated the first round is an inside investor because of his or her strong tie with the entrepreneur. The information asymmetry between the entrepreneur and the VC investors community is reduced at the end of the first round because one member of the community is an inside investor who can share his or her information with his or her peers by inviting them into the syndication for the second and following rounds to fund the development of the start-up.  \n\nThrough the existing tie built in the first round of funding between the entrepreneur and the lead investor, the latter becomes a bridge between the entrepreneur and the community of investors. Ties between the lead investor and other investors are important to explain the latter's participation in the funding of following stages as passive investors. The inside investor can be assumed to reveal information truthfully, since he or she has no incentive to misrepresent it. If any reputational assets are at stake with outside investors, the venture capitalist will clearly reveal the information truthfully, thereby resolving the informational asymmetry (Admati & Pfeiderer, 1994). The presence of an inside investor such as a venture capitalist can reduce some of the agency costs that arise for the community of investors if the entrepreneur's effort level is unobservable. In following rounds of investment to fund the next stages of the start-up development, the effects of entrepreneurial effort are probably not directly observable by outside parties who are not monitoring the firm since these effects take the form of an increased probability of success that is hard to measure.  \n\nIf the initial investor decides to fund a second round, it means the project is a potential success (otherwise he or she would not do this) and his or her evaluation is based on inside information. If the initial investor does not fund the following stages of a start-up, this gives a negative signal to outside investors. There is an implicit obligation for the primary investor to invest in the following stages to attract new investors and to show his or her confidence in the potential success of the start-up. At this point, he or she can invite other investors by using his or her “lead investor’ position or he or she can invest alone. Invited investors might refuse the invitation if they are not interested in the start-up. The lead investor of a seed stage is not necessarily the lead investor in subsequent rounds. However, he or she strongly influences the lead investor for the following stage by choosing the investors that can get the opportunity to invest. The informal privilege to invite other investors is an implicit right to choose the lead investor of the next round of funding (Podolny, 1993). By inviting other investors instead of investing alone, the lead investor implicitly shares the potential profit. The main question remains: Why does the inside investor invite outside investors into following syndications?  \n\nI hypothesize that a lead investor invites other investors through syndications in order to pool resources to sustain the development of the start-up that he or she funded at the seed stage. In order to sustain the development of start-ups in which he or she has invested and to prepare his or her exit strategy, the lead investor uses his or her inside investor privilege as a resource to invite other kinds of investors (large industrial firms, investment banks, and private equity firms) to share private information in the following stages (early, expansion, and later stages). It can be argued that the lead investor uses his or her informal privilege by inviting other investors to share his or her private knowledge in order to initiate a reciprocal exchange with partners owning complementary resources to develop the funded start-up. This invitation is a gift made by pure venture capitalists in order to initiate reciprocal exchanges with other categories of investors by creating the obligation to reciprocate in the future.  \n\nThe gift exchange theory (Mauss, 1923) is useful for understanding informal exchanges between investors involved in syndications (Ferrary, 2006). The principles of Mauss’ Gift Exchange Theory specify several rules. First, an agent has to give first in order to receive something from another. Second, an individual who receives a gift has to reciprocate, and this is an informal and implicit contract. By definition, reciprocation is delayed (otherwise, it is a barter exchange), and its nature and its terms are not defined. This intrinsically introduces uncertainty into the exchange. The giver is not sure to receive a counter-gift as long as the receiver has not actually reciprocated. Third, the giver gives his or her gift in front of the community to secure reciprocation through social pressure. All community members know the implicit rules of gift exchange (it is common knowledge). Four, if the receiver does not reciprocate, then his or her interindividual exchange with the giver ends. He or she also loses his or her status in the community and gains a negative reputation.  \n\nAn application of these principles to the relationships between institutional VC investors is that an invitation made by the initial investor is a “gift’ (that can be accepted or refused) to other investors in order to involve agents able to sustain the development of the start-up and to prepare an exit strategy (Ferrary, 2003b). The more mature the start-up becomes, the more the initial VC investor tries to pool resources by inviting new investors.  \n\nThus, one can expect that the number of investors increases with the maturity of invested companies.  \n\nHypothesis 3: The number of investors in syndications is positively related to the maturity of funded start-ups.  \n\nThe development of a start-up needs funding to recruit people, settle new branches, or industrialize a product. A syndicate of several investors provides more capital availability for current and follow-on cash needs (Gompers & Lerner, 2004, p. 257). Then, the more obvious justification for the lead investor to invite other investors is to gain more financial resources to support the following development stages of start-ups in which it has invested. In the following stages, investors arbitrate between allocating investments in start-ups already invested in or diversifying their investments by investing in new startups. By inviting another VC firm, a lead investor gets more funding in exchange for an investment opportunity and a potential future invitation if the passive VC firm becomes the lead investor of a future syndication. As mentioned by Hochberg et al. (2007), a VC firm is able to generate investment opportunities in the future by syndicating its own deals today in the hope of future reciprocation from its syndication partners.  \n\nOne can expect that the number of pure VC firms increases in syndications that fund the following stages of invested start-ups in order to bring more financial resources.3  \n\nHypothesis 4: The number of investors in syndications is positively related to the amount of capital invested.  \n\nIf a pure VC firm wants to access resources owned by large industrial firms, investment banks, or private equity firms in order to sustain start-ups in which he or she has invested and prepare an exit strategy, he or she has to give something first to initiate the exchange. His or her invitation to share private information by participating in a syndicate constitutes this initial gift. By inviting investment banks, corporate VC units, and/or private equity firms, a lead VC expects that these partners will reciprocate the gift. There is no formal contract between the investors to enforce reciprocity (the formal contract is only between the start-up and its investors but not between the investors). The investors are bundled by an informal contract. The different kinds of investors have different resources that they use in reciprocal gift exchange to reach their objectives. In order to prepare their exit strategy, pure VC firms use their lead investor's informal rights to invite private equity firms, investment banks, and large industrial companies in rounds of funding of the following stages. In return, these firms have access to privileged ties and private information for their investment decision making. The pure VC's gift is private information accumulated at the seed stage. Other investors’ counter-gifts could be partnership, acquisition, or IPO. There is no legal device to enforce this. Reciprocation is intrinsically delayed because the investor invited to the syndication will only be able to reciprocate in the future when the start-up needs its resources. The inviting investor has to support uncertainty on the reciprocation because the receiver could potentially not return the gift. However, for a pure VC firm, that is the only way to prepare an exit strategy.  \n\nThe investment bank's competence implicitly secures the success of an IPO or an acquisition. So the gift exchange between a pure VC firm and an investment bank is that the first invites the second in the later stages of start-up funding and the investment bank returns the gift by securing the IPO or the acquisition. The lead investor has an interest in inviting an investment bank into syndication of the later stage when he or she needs the bank's competencies.  \n\nThe relation is the same with large industrial companies. A lead VC invites a large corporation in the following stages to favor a business partnership with the start-up and gives access to private information. The reciprocation will be the acquisition of the start-up by the large company in the future. The relationship between the VC firm Sequoia Capital and Cisco Systems is an archetype of this kind of informal exchange through syndication. Between 1994 and 2000, Cisco Systems (a large industrial firm) was invited into 13 syndications led by Sequoia Capital (a pure VC firm). Later, Cisco Systems acquired five of them shortly after its investment: Allegro Systems (8 months after its investment), MaxComm Technologies (13 months), Netiverse (9 months), Precept Software (3 months), and StratumOne Communications (3 months). The lead investor takes a risk because the potential acquisition by the large company is intrinsically delayed from its participation in the syndication and there is no formal contract to enforce the informal obligation. More than this, there is a risk that the large corporation will use private information to duplicate the innovation internally and not acquire the start-up at all. This uncertainty is due to the informality of the relationship and the delay of reciprocation that intrinsically characterizes gift exchange.  \n\nA similar relation can be expected between pure VC firms that lead syndication and private equity firms. The latter have a complementary investment strategy with VC firms. They invest a larger amount of capital in companies that generate positive cash fow. The profitability of the company invested in is crucial because its cash flow is used to reimburse debts contracted to buy the company. A lead VC is interested in inviting a private equity firm in later stages when it expects that the latter will totally acquire the company in the future. By investing in later stages, a private equity firm gets private information to eventually decide to acquire the company.  \n\nFunding syndications of seed stages are supposed to be homogeneous because of the specialization of pure VC firms on this kind of funding. Conversely, the involvement of investment banks, large industrial companies, and private equity firms should increase the heterogeneity of syndication. One can expect that the enlargement of syndications is positively related to their heterogeneity due to the invitation of investment banks, large industrial companies, and private equity firms by the lead investor to sustain the growth of invested start-ups.  \n\nHypothesis 5: The number of investors in syndication is positively related to the heterogeneity of syndications.  \n\n## Methods  \n\n### Data  \n\nThe research is based on a statistical analysis of the 2,715 rounds of VC syndication carried out in the United States in 2005.4 Price WaterhouseCoopers collects information on VC syndications. The PriceWaterhouseCoopers database provides information on the name of the company funded, the development stage of the funded company, the name of investors involved in the syndication, the amount invested, the industry, and the quarter of investment. Thirty-six syndications were dropped from the population for this research because some information was missing in the database (mainly the name of some investors).  \n\nTable 1 Means, Standard Deviations, Ranges, and Correlations $(\\mathrm{N}=2{,}679)$   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>1 Investors</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2 Heterogeneity</td><td>0.6501*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3 Maturity</td><td>0.1902*</td><td>0.2152*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4 Venture capitalfirm</td><td>0.7298*</td><td>0.3143*</td><td>0.0516*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5 Investment bank</td><td>0.2856*</td><td>0.4671*</td><td>0.1637*</td><td>0.0564*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6 Private equity firm</td><td>0.2690*</td><td>0.5355*</td><td>0.1755*</td><td>0.1437*</td><td>0.0902*</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7 Large industrial firm</td><td>0.3628*</td><td>0.5613*</td><td>0.1538*</td><td>0.1179*</td><td>0.1120*</td><td>0.0877*</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8Amount</td><td>0.5972*</td><td>0.4410*</td><td>0.2276*</td><td>0.4113*</td><td>0.2524*</td><td>0.2308*</td><td>0.2467*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>2.76</td><td>1.41</td><td>2.80</td><td>1.67</td><td>0.14</td><td>0.36</td><td>0.19</td><td>6.77</td></tr><tr><td>Standarddeviation</td><td>1.92</td><td>0.69</td><td>0.80</td><td>1.37</td><td>0.42</td><td>0.62</td><td>0.50</td><td>9.88</td></tr><tr><td>Minimum</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum</td><td>13</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>156</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n$^{*}p\\leq0.01$  \n\nThis database has been improved with information provided by Galante's Venture Capital & Private Equity Directory on the type of institutional investor: pure VC firm, private equity firm, investment bank or large industrial company. In 2005, 1,379 different investors were involved in the 2,679 syndications analyzed and 790 of them were pure venture capital firms (Sequoia Capital; Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers; Mayfield Fund, etc.) that represent $57.29\\%$ of investors involved in VC syndication. Eighty-five of them were investment banks (Goldman Sachs, CSFB, Lehman Brothers, etc.) or $6.16\\%$ of investors, and 182 were large industrial companies (Lucent Technologies, Siemens, Kodak, Chevron, Merck, etc.) or $13.20\\%$ of investors. Finally, 322 of them were private equity firms (Sprout, Bain Capital, Carlyle, etc.) or $23.35\\%$ of investors.  \n\nSome of these investors participated in several syndications. For example, in 2005, the Mayfield Fund was the most active pure VC firm with 37 investments (31 for Menlo Venture; 28 for Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers; and 26 for Sequoia Capital). Intel Capital was the most active large industrial company with 43 investments. JP Morgan Partners was the most active investment bank investor with 40 investments and Sprout was the most active private equity firm with 18 investments (Table 1).  \n\n### Measures  \n\nA specific analysis of the 160 funding syndications of seed stages was performed to test hypotheses 1 and 2. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with robust standard error control (Eicker-White) have been conducted to test hypotheses 3, 4, and 5.  \n\n#### Dependent Variable  \n\nThe Number of Investors in Syndication. The purpose of this research is to explain why investors syndicate their VC investments. Explaining the evolution of the syndication size is a way to explore the reasons for syndication. The PriceWaterhouseCoopers database provides the number of investors for each syndication. One hypothesis is that syndications are used by lead investors to pool resources to sustain the development of invested start-ups. The more mature an invested start-up is, the larger and more diversified its syndication is.  \n\n#### Independent Variables  \n\nThe Maturity of the Funded Company. The different stages of start-up development are clearly defined by the VC industry. When they get funding, companies are obliged to publicize the name of their investors and to specify which stage of development is being funded. There are four different development stages. According to the National Venture Capital Association classification, the first stage is the seed/start-up stage. At this stage, the start-up is just a concept. It has no product or client, and sometimes, the company does not even exist. The second stage is the early stage. At this stage, the company has a product or a service under test or pilot production. In some cases, the product may be commercially available. It may or may not be generating revenues. The third stage is the expansion stage. At this stage, the product or service is in production and commercially available. The company demonstrates significant revenue growth but may or may not be showing profit. It has usually been in business for over 3 years. The last stage is the later stage. At this stage, the product or service is widely available. The company is generating ongoing revenue and probably has a positive cash flow. It is more likely to be profitable (but not necessarily). The company is close to going public or can be acquired by a large company or by a private equity firm. Among the 2,679 syndications listed by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 160 were made at the seed stage, 706 at the early stage, 1,322 at the expansion stage, and 491 at the later stage. The same stage might be funded by several rounds. Generally, the seed stage is funded through one or two rounds and the following stages by three or four rounds of funding.  \n\nAmount Invested. Pooling financial resources is one of the justifications for the lead investor to invite investors into his or her syndication. The PriceWaterhouseCoopers database gives the amount of capital raised by syndicate at each round of funding.  \n\nHeterogeneity of the Syndication. A resource-based perspective explains syndication by the involvement of different investors with complementary resources that can sustain the development of the company in which they invested. In this case, the size of the syndication can be explained by the increasing heterogeneity of investors. This heterogeneity can be operationalized by a scale in which a syndicate is labeled 1 when there is only one category of investor and 4 when all four categories of investors (pure venture capital firm, investment bank, large industrial company, and private equity firm) are represented in the syndicate. The first is the most homogeneous syndicate and the last the most heterogeneous.  \n\n#### Control Variables  \n\nIndustry. The industrial sector of the company in which they invested may influence the syndication. Some sectors may require more funding or may mobilize different resources. In this case, the size of the syndication is controlled by the industry. The  \n\nPriceWaterhouseCoopers database identifies 17 different industries (biotechnology, IT services, business products and services, computers and peripherals, consumer products and  services, electronics/instrumentation, financial services, healthcare services, industrial/energy, media and entertainment, medical devices and equipment, networking and equipment, retailing and distribution, semiconductors, software, telecommunications, andothers).  \n\nLocation of the Start-Up. VC practices can vary across the United States. The size of the syndication has been controlled for by the 18 geographical classifications used in the PriceWaterhouseCoopers database (Silicon Valley, LA/Orange County, Colorado, New England, New York Metro, Midwest, Northwest).  \n\nThe Quarter. The timing of investment could affect syndication in a “window dressing\" perspective (Lakonishok, Shleifer, Thaler, & Vishny, 1991). Investors could be incited to invest more in the last quarter to justify the use of their funds. General partners who run VC funds are accountable for their investments to the limited partners who invest in these funds.  \n\n## Results  \n\nThe resource pooling model is based on two assumptions. First, pure VC firms convert uncertainty into risk by funding the seed stage, and this function is based on socially strongly embedded business relationships. These can only be handled by very few investors for each investment accomplished at the seed stage. Second, syndications are used as a collaborating structure by interdependent investors who own complementary resources in order to sustain the growth of funded start-ups and prepare the exit strategy of the lead investor.  \n\n### Syndications of the Seed Stage  \n\nAn analysis of 160 incidents of seed stage funding from 2005 (Table 2) reveals that $65\\%$ are not syndicated, and $21.25\\%$ are syndicated by only two investors. These figures corroborate hypothesis 1 that VC investors rarely syndicate funding of seed stages. An obvious explanation is that start-ups need less funding at the seed stage than at further stages. Then, fewer investors should be involved at this stage. Figures support this explanation. The average investment at seed stages is lower than at following stages. However, a more detailed analysis of seed stage investments points out that the invested amount is not strictly related to the number of investors. At the seed stage, when there is only one investor, the average investment is $\\$2.33$ million, $\\$2.12$ million for two, $\\$1.35$ million for three, and $\\$2.93$ million for four investors. This gives room for a complementary explanation based on the constraints related to the socialization of investors and entrepreneurs at the seed stage. The creation and nurturing of social ties between investors and entrepreneurs in order to deal with uncertainty is emotionally costly and time consuming. Only few investors are involved in the seed stage to develop the necessary strong social tie through learning by collaborative relationships.  \n\nTable 2 Funding of Seed Stages   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Numberofinvestors</td><td>Number of deals (%)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>104 (65.00)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>34 (21.25)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>13 (8.13)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4 (2.50)</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3 (1.88)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1 (0.63)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>0 (0.0)</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>0 (0.0)</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>1 (0.63)</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>160 (100.0)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable3 Distribution of Institutional Venture Capital Investors by Stage   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Seed stage (%)</td><td>Early stage (%)</td><td>Expansion stage (%)</td><td>Later stage (%)</td></tr><tr><td>PureVentureCapitalFirm</td><td>229 (89.11)</td><td>1,121 (80.01)</td><td>2,178 (68.28)</td><td>951 (64.69)</td></tr><tr><td>InvestmentBank</td><td>5 (1.95)</td><td>33 (2.36)</td><td>204 (6.39)</td><td>122 (8.30)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>7 (2.72)</td><td>77 (5.50)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LargeIndustrial Company</td><td>16 (6.23)</td><td>170 (12.13)</td><td>276 (8.65)</td><td>142 (9.66)</td></tr><tr><td>PrivateEquityFirm Totalnumberofinvestors</td><td>257 (100.0)</td><td>1,401 (100.0)</td><td>532 (16.68) 3,190 (100.0)</td><td>255 (17.35) 1,470 (100.0)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nConcerning the labor division between institutional VC investors and the specialization of pure VC firms in funding of seed stages, the figures show that at this stage, 229 investors out of 257 are pure VC firms (Table 3).

In comparison with the other investors (investment banks, private equity firms, and corporate VC units), they are overrepresented at this stage. This distribution is due to the specialization of pure VC firms in the conversion of uncertainty into risk through seed stage investments and to the focusing of other institutional investors on the following stages.  \n\nThis supports hypothesis 2 that pure VC firms are the main investors at this stage among institutional VC investors because they own the specific competence to convert uncertainty into risk by creating strong ties with entrepreneurs and their business environment. The predominant presence of pure VC firms at the seed stage is because they originate the relationship with the entrepreneur.  \n\n### Syndications to Pool Resources in Following Stages  \n\nAccording to the informal rule of the VC industry, the primary investor invites other investors into his or her syndication. The lead investor position and the informal privilege to invite other investors are mainly owned by pure VC firms because in general, they are the primary investors in the first round.  \n\nThe number of investors increases during the funding life cycle and the maturing of invested companies. From an average number of 1.61 investors at the seed stage, this number increases at each following stage: 1.98 at the early stage, 2.41 at the expansion stage, and 2.95 at the later stage. The question is: Why do pure VC firms syndicate in the following stages when they do not in the seed stage?  \n\nTable 4 Ordinary Least Squares Regression $(\\mathrm{N}=2{,}679)$   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Model 1</td><td>Model 2</td><td>Model 3</td><td>Model 4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Controlvariables Industry</td><td>0.018***(-2.52)</td><td>-0.0205***(-2.96)</td><td>-0.0039 (-0.63)</td><td>-0.0126***(-2.48)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0.0054 (0.65)</td><td></td><td>0.0022 (0.34)</td></tr><tr><td>Region Date</td><td>0.0120 (1.37)</td><td></td><td>0.0084 (1.02)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>0.0070 (0.21) 2.8062*** (17.8)</td><td>0.0072 (0.22) 1.4654*** (8.17)</td><td>0.0039 (0.46) 2.1398** (14.81)</td><td>0.3107 (1.3) 0.0904 (0.68)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Independentvariables</td><td></td><td>0.5252***(11.68)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Maturity</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Amount</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0892***(7.10)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Heterogeneity</td><td>0.0034</td><td></td><td></td><td>1.9122*** (35.67)</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td></td><td>0.0515</td><td>0.2136</td><td>0.4748</td></tr><tr><td>F-statistic p>F</td><td>2.75 0.0415</td><td>34.73 0.0000</td><td>16.38 0.0000</td><td>320.19 0.0000</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Dependent variable: Number of investors in syndication.

The type of industry, the region, and the quarter of investment are not statistically significant to explain the enlargement of syndications.  \n\nModel 2 of the OLS regression analysis, which adds the independent variable “maturity” to the control variables to test hypothesis 3, reveals that the maturity of invested companies is statistically significant to explain the enlargement of syndication. The coefficient is positive $(\\mathrm{b}=0.525$ $p=0.000,$ 0, which indicates that lead investors invite other investors to support the growth of invested companies when the latter become more mature.  \n\nThis supports hypothesis 3, according to which the start-up development needs other resources than those provided by pure VC firms and that syndications of the following stages are used to involve other kinds of investors that bring in different and complementaryresources.  \n\nModel 3 of the OLS regression analysis, which adds the independent variable \"amount’ to the control variables to test hypothesis 4, reveals that the amount invested by the syndication is statistically significant to explain the enlargement of syndication. The coefficient is positive $(\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{b}}=0.892$ $p=0.000,$ 0, which indicates that lead investors invite other investors to pool financial resources in order to fund the growth of invested companies. The ${\\mathbf{R}}^{2}$ of 0.2136 means that $21.36\\%$ of the variance of the size of the syndication is accounted for by the model after adding investment amount. On average, rounds of funding at seed stages raise $\\$2.13$ million, $\\$4.64$ million at early stages, $\\$7.36$ million at expansion stages, and $\\$9.43$ million at later stages.  \n\nModel 4 of the OLS regression analysis, which adds the independent variable “heterogeneity” to the control variables to test hypothesis 5, reveals that heterogeneity is statistically significant to explain the enlargement of syndication. The coefficient is positive $(\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{b}}=1.912$ $p=0.000,$ 0, which indicates that lead investors invite investment banks, large industrial companies, and private equity firms in the funding of following stages. It predicts that the size of syndication is explained by its increasing heterogeneity. The ${\\mathbf{R}}^{2}$ of 0.4748 means that $47.48\\%$ of the variance of the size of the syndication is accounted for by the model after adding heterogeneity. This result supports the idea that pure VC firms use their lead investor privilege to invite different investors owning resources to sustain the growth of the funded start-up and to prepare an exit strategy. Pure VC firms highly increase the heterogeneity of syndication as soon as the early stage when the uncertain asset has been converted into a risky asset and the invitation privilege into syndication has become valuable for the lead investor.  \n\nThe combination of the two findings, first, that pure VC firms initiate syndications by funding seed stages and, second, that other kinds of investors (large industrial firms, investment banks, and private equity firms) are involved in the following stages to increase the heterogeneity of syndication supports the hypothesis that lead investors use their informal right to invite other investors in the following stages to share their inside information and to get support in return for developing funded start-ups and to prepare an exit strategy.  \n\n## Discussion  \n\nThe purpose of this research is to explain why institutional investors in VC syndicate their investments. The resource pooling model is based on two specific features of the VC industry. First, at the seed stage, due to the youth of start-ups that induces a lack of formal and historical data, investors are not dealing with risk but with uncertainty. Second, institutional VC investors constitute a heterogeneous community (pure VC firms, corporate VC units of large industrial companies, investment banks, and private equity firms) of interdependent agents interested in start-ups. Among these institutional investors, pure VC firms handle the specific function of converting uncertainty into risk through their social networks and a learning-by-collaborating relationship that takes place through the funding of the seed stage. At this stage, investment is used as a legal device to socially embed the business relation between investors and entrepreneurs in order to collect the tacit knowledge needed to reduce uncertainty. Entrepreneurs and investors can only create and nurture a limited number of strong ties because the creation of strong ties is emotionally costly and time consuming for both actors of the relationship. This is why at the funding of the seed stage, only one or two investors, mainly pure VC firms, are involved. In the following rounds of funding, the initial investor becomes the lead investor who continues to nurture the strong tie, and new investors are more passive investors involved in weak ties with the entrepreneur.  \n\n### Implications for Theory and Practice  \n\nOne of the main findings of social networks theory (Granovetter, 1973, 1985) is that preexisting social ties determine the formal contract. Social embeddedness makes possible a business exchange by reducing uncertainty. The analysis of the VC industry points out another relation: a formal contract can be used to create social ties. The funding of a seed stage is a formal contract that allows a learning-by-collaborating relationship between investors and entrepreneurs in order to transform uncertainty into risk. The formal contract sustains the construction of the strong social tie needed to create and transfer tacit knowledge. If social ties influence business contracts, it is also true that business contracts influence the creation of social ties. Economic sociology has broadly explored the influence of social networks on business contracts but more rarely on how these networks are created. The analysis of the hidden side of contracts points out that they can be an embedding device that will influence future business contracts by creating strong ties between actors. This could be an interesting research perspective.  \n\nConcerning VC activity, my research suggests some practices for pure VC firms, especially for those entering this industry. First, evaluation of start-ups for VC investment differs from other kinds of assets. It is based on tacit knowledge that can mainly be collected through social networks. The main competence of a venture capitalist is more on his or her capability to accumulate the right social capital than his or her technical competence in financial analysis. Second, the profitability of VC firms is linked to their capability to mobilize other kinds of economic agents to support start-ups in which they have invested. Syndication is a device to organize such informal alliances and to bring resourcestostart-ups.  \n\nFor non-pure VC firms, this research points out that uncertainty management needs specific competencies and a high level of embeddedness that cannot be handled by non-pure VC firms. This explains the weak presence of large industrial companies, investment banks, and private equity firms in round of funding the seed stage. For example, in 2005, Intel, the largest industrial investor in VC, did not invest in a seed stage and neither did JP Morgan (the largest investor in the investment bank category) and Sprout (the largest investor in the private equity category). Conversely, they should nurture ties with pure VC firms in order to be invited into syndication of the following stages. By participating in syndicates, they get inside information on start-ups, which improves their decision making (acquisition for a large industrial company or a private equity firm; underwriting IPO for an investment bank).  \n\nRisk management is well-developed in finance on its theoretical and practical dimensions. Yet, the literature on uncertainty management is rarer. The VC industry suggests that at a macroeconomic level, some economic agents are specialized in dealing with uncertainty to convert it into risk before other economic agents specialized in risk management handle these assets.  \n\n### Limitations and Extensions  \n\nThere are two main limitations to this research. First, this research contributes to strategic network analysis by showing that VC syndication of investments in start-ups is a possible framework for cooperation between economic agents. A syndicate can be a cooperative structure for alliances such as joint ventures or long-term contracts. It could be valuable to explore how the heterogeneity of the syndication influences the performance of start-ups. That is a boulevard for new research on the VC industry to validate the common result of studies on strategic networks that network embeddedness of the firm influences its performance (Echols & Tsai, 2004).  \n\nSecond, there is a methodological issue to statistically validate a gift exchange explanation of relations between investors involved in syndications. The absence of a formal contract to specify reciprocal obligations between the investors (for example, the obligation for a large industrial firm to sustain the start-up and eventually acquire it when it participates in a syndicate) and the fact that the reciprocation is intrinsically delayed (for example, an investment bank will underwrite an IPO only several years after its invitation in a syndicate) suggest that the gift exchange theory might be an interesting framework to explain relationships between investors involved in syndication.  \n\nEven if some empirical evidence and interviews with investors support this explanation, it is methodologically difficult to prove it. There is no quantitative evidence of a gift exchange relationship between investors, but some findings indirectly support this hypothesis. The lack of historical data does not allow me to statistically validate the existence of a counter-gift. In my database, the majority of start-ups are still in their development phase and are too young to have been acquired or to have become public. This information is needed to examine whether large industrial companies, investment banks, and private equity firms reciprocate the gift when they have been invited into a syndicate. This limitation opens a research opportunity based on my database. In 3 or 4 years, when we know how each start-up evolved (bankruptcy, acquisition of IPO), reciprocation can be analyzed statistically.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nAdmati, A. & Pfeiderer, P. (1994).

Ferreira ISCTE Business School-Lisbon  \n\nPedro Matost Marshall School of Business University of Southern California  \n\nThis version: July 2007 (forthcoming in the Journal of Financial Economics)  \n\n# Abstract  \n\nWe study the role of institutional investors around the world using a comprehensive data set of equity holdings from 27 countries. Domestic, U.S.-, and non-U.S.-based foreign institutions hold comparable shares of non-U.S. corporations. We find that all institutional investors have a strong preference for the stock of large firms and firms with strong governance indicators, while foreign institutions tend to overweight firms that are cross-listed in the U.S. and members of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index. We find that frms with higher ownership by foreign and independent institutions (unlike other institutions) have higher firm valuations, better operating performance, and lower capital expenditures. Our results indicate that foreign and independent institutions, with potentially fewer business ties to firms and freer from management infuence, are involved in monitoring corporations worldwide.  \n\nJEL classification: G15, G20, G32 Keywords: Institutional Investors, Monitoring, International Capital Markets  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nA key factor in global capital markets is the fast growing importance of institutional investors. These professional investors manage financial assets exceeding US\\$45 trillion (including over US\\$20 trillion in equities) according to the International Monetary Fund (2005) (IMF). Assets under management of institutions have tripled since the early 1990s. Institutional investors are major players not just in developed markets; their role is rapidly growing in emerging market countries (see Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano (2005)).  \n\nIn this paper we examine what drives institutional investors to firms and what role these investors play. Gillan and Starks (2003) posit that the rise of professional money managers as a large shareholder group in corporations worldwide offers the potential for increased monitoring of firm management. Institutions’ involvement can range from threatening the sale of shares to the active use of corporate voting rights or meetings with management.1 We are interested in whether these large investors are effective in infuencing corporate management and boards towards creating shareholder value. But there are reasons to expect that not all money managers are equally equipped or motivated to be active monitors. Foreign and more independent institutions are many times credited with taking a more active stance, while other institutions that have business relations with local corporations may feel compelled to be loyal to management.2 For example, Fidelity is reported to be more aggressive on governance issues in Europe, but it is relatively acquiescent in the U.S. where it manages several corporate pension accounts (Business Week (2006), Davis and Kim (2006)).  \n\nThere is little evidence on the monitoring role of institutional investors outside the U.S., so we offer a first exploration of this issue. To pursue this goal, we use a new comprehensive database of institutional stock holdings worldwide. The data set contains holdings at the stock-investor level of over 5,300 institutions in 27 countries, with positions totaling US\\$ 18 trillion as of December 2005. Thus, the institutional ownership data used in this paper represents nearly 40% of the world stock market capitalization.  \n\nFor a better understanding of the role of institutional investors worldwide, we focus on non-U.S. frms in which institutions hold US $\\mathbb{S}$ 5.2 trillion.3 These institutional investors, depending on their geographic origin, could be a U.S.-based mutual fund manager (like Fidelity), a non-U.S.-based pension or endowment fund (like Norway's State Petroleum Fund), or a domestic bank trust or insurance company (like BNP Paribas and AXA in France). U.S.-based institutions overall hold more than US\\$ 2 trillion overseas in non-U.S. stocks. This is matched by US\\$ 1.7 trillion held by non-U.S. foreign institutions and US\\$ 1.5 trillion by domestic institutions. Thus, while most research so far looks at U.S. institutions as the primary source of capital, we find that the three groups of professional investors worldwide have similar pools of capital.  \n\nWe start by exploring the revealed stock preferences of these three different institutional investor clienteles (U.S., non-U.S. foreign, and domestic money managers), and investigate which firm- and country-level characteristics attract a particular group. Our results reveal preferences when investing at home, much like those that U.S. institutions exhibit in U.S. markets (Gompers and Metrick (2001)), but money managers exhibit specific preferences when investing abroad.  \n\nFirst, we find that all institutional investors, whatever their geographic origin, share a preference for the stock of large and widely held firms (i.e., companies without large controlling blockholders), in countries with strong disclosure standards, and located physically near their home market. Second, foreign and domestic institutional investors diverge in some stock preferences. Foreign institutional investors have a strong bias for firms in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World Index, firms that are cross-listed on a U.S. exchange, and firms that have external visibility through high foreign sales and analyst coverage. Domestic institutions underweight these same stocks. Foreign institutions also tend to avoid high dividend-paying stocks. Third, U.S. institutions diverge from non-U.S. foreign institutions in their preference for value over growth stocks, and a tendency to hold stocks in English-speaking countries and emerging markets. Thus, there is generally substantial diversity in the revealed stock preferences of various groups of institutional investors depending on their geographic origin.  \n\nAnother dimension of investor diversity is institution type. We can characterize professional money managers as being of different “colors\" in terms of their ability to be active in monitoring managers’ decisions. Because of potential business ties with the firms in which they invest, not all money managers act as independent shareholders whose only consideration is shareholder value maximization. Following Brickley et al. (1988), Almazan et al. (2005), and Chen et al. (2006), we divide institutions into two groups: independent institutions (mutual fund managers and investment advisers) and grey institutions (bank trusts, insurance companies, and other institutions). Independent institutions tend to be \"pressure-resistant\", while grey institutions tend to be “pressure-sensitive” or loyal to corporate management. For example, Brickley et al. (1988) find that banks and insurance companies are more supportive of management actions than other types of institutional investors in antitakeover amendment proposals.  \n\nUsing this classification, we first examine similarities and differences in investment preferences that may arise out of distinct investment mandates and objectives. We find that both types of institutions share a preference for large, widely held, and visible stocks consistent with findings in the U.S. market (Bennett, Sias, and Starks (2003)). The results also show that independent managers invest more in firms with liquid stocks and frms in countries with strong legal environments, compared to grey managers (especially bank-controlled ones).  \n\nThen, we examine which “colors” of investors matter in terms of monitoring and infuencing management decisions. We investigate whether there are effects of institutional ownership on frm performance, particularly for different groups of institutions. Monitoring is usually considered to cost less for independent than for grey institutions, because the latter have an disadvantage in pressuring corporate managers for changes, as this may harm their business relationships with the frm (Chen et al. (2006). Similarly, foreign institutional investors are often believed to play more of a role in prompting changes in corporate governance practices than domestic money managers (Gillan and Starks (2003)).  \n\nWe conjecture that the presence of foreign and independent institutions with large stakes has the potential to enhance firm value through direct or indirect monitoring. By direct monitoring we mean the direct intervention of institutions in voicing the interest of shareholders to corporate management (e.g. in proxy contests). By indirect monitoring we mean the effect of institutions on firm valuation if they act as a group to divest their investment in a company, thereby pushing up its cost of capital. As an alternative hypothesis, the valuation gains associated with the presence of foreign and independent institutions can be transitory (rather than permanent), which is consistent with overvaluation or market timing. Recent work by Gozzi, Levine, and Schmukler (2006) and Sarkissian and Schill (2006) suggest that firms that access international markets have transitory valuation gains.  \n\nTo test these monitoring effects, we regress Tobin's $Q$ ratios of our global sample of firms on firm-, industry-, and country-level variables (as in Lins (2003) and Doidge et al. (2004)), and also add the fraction of shares held by different groups of institutional investors. We find that ownership by foreign and independent institutions has a significantly positive impact on firm valuation, unlike ownership by domestic and grey institutions. Because institutional ownership is likely to be jointly determined with firms’ Tobin's $Q$ ratios and driven by other firm characteristics (as revealed by our tests on investor preferences), we re-estimate the Tobin's $Q$ and institutional ownership equations as a system of simultaneous equations. We find consistent evidence of a strong positive relation between firm value and foreign and independent institutional ownership. No similar result is found for domestic and grey investors.  \n\nTo differentiate monitoring effects and overvaluation effects, we assess whether foreign and independent institutional ownership has a positive infuence on a firm's operating performance and investment policy as well. We find a positive association of foreign and inde pendent institutional ownership with return on assets ( $R O A$ ) and net profit margin $(N P M)$ Furthermore, we find that the presence of foreign and independent institutions also reduces capital expenditures $(C A P E X$ ), thereby suggesting that institutional investor pressure curtails a manager's incentives to (over)invest. Substantiating the monitoring interpretation of our findings, there is no similar relation between ownership by domestic and grey institutions and firm performance.  \n\nWe contribute to the literature on corporate governance around the world in speaking to the debate on whether institutional investors’ monitoring and activism is effective. For the U.S., the evidence so far is somewhat mixed. Parrino et al. (2003) find that institutional selling infuences the decision of the board of directors to fire a CEO, while Gillan and Starks (2003) find typically modest stock price reactions to shareholder proposals by activist institutions. Other studies show that certain types of institutional investors have some infuence on specific corporate events such as anti-takeover amendments (Brickley et al. (1988)), research and development expenditures (Bushee (1998)), executive compensation (Almazan et al. (2005)), and merger and acquisition decisions (Gaspar, Massa, and Matos (2005) and Chen et al. (2006)).  \n\nOur study of the effects of the “colors\" of the firm's shareholder base in an international capital markets setting is an important contribution to the literature. Other papers analyze frms’ cost of capital and how it is potentially reduced by a larger investor base (Merton (1987), Foerster and Karolyi (1999)) and by cross-listing shares in the U.S. as a bonding mechanism (Doidge et al. (2004) and Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2007)). These authors document a positive valuation effect associated with cross-listing on a U.S. exchange. Our results go one step further to offer a direct link between foreign and independent institutional shareholder presence and firm performance because of the monitoring role these institutions serve. We interpret these positive valuation effect as a form of reputational bonding (Coffee (2002) and Stulz (1999)) that arises from the presence of highly reputable institutions as large shareholders, rather than the legal bonding associated with a U.S. cross-listing.4  \n\nWe use a more comprehensive data set than other studies of the revealed preferences of institutional investors: domestic and foreign ownership in a single destination country (the U.S. as in Gompers and Metrick (2001), Japan as in Kang and Stulz (1997), or Sweden as in Dahlquist and Robertsson (2001); foreign holdings by investors from one single country (U.S. investors as in Aggarwal, Klapper, and Wysocki (2005), Ammer, Holland, Smith, and Warnock (2005), and Leuz, Lins, and Warnock (2005)); country-level institutional holdings or blockholdings (Chan, Covrig, and Ng (2005), Li, Moshirian, Pham, and Zein (2006)); holdings from just one class of institutions (mutual funds as in Covrig, Lau, and Ng (2006)); or holdings for a single year. There are, of course, challenges with our data, which we also discuss.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the institutional holdings data, the sample of firms, and describes other variables. In section 3, we conduct our tests on which firm and country characteristics attract institutional investors. Section 4 studies the valuation effects of different groups of institutions, and also their impact on operating performance and capital budgeting decisions. Section 5 concludes and discusses the implications of our work.  \n\n# 2. Data Description  \n\n## 2.1. Institutional Investors Holdings Data  \n\nThe stock holdings data are drawn from the FactSet /LionShares database, which is a leading information source for global institutional ownership.5 Institutions, which are defined as professional money managers with discretionary control over assets (such as mutual funds, pension funds, bank trusts, and insurance companies), are frequently required to disclose publicly their holdings.  \n\nFor equities traded in the U.S., FactSet /LionShares gathers institutional holdings from the mandatory quarterly 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as by rolling up the holdings by individual mutual funds (N-30D filings with the SEC) managed by a particular fund management company. For equities traded outside the U.S., FactSet /LionShares collects ownership data directly from sources such as national regulatory agencies or stock exchange announcements (e.g., the Regulatory News Service in the U.K.), local and offshore mutual funds, mutual fund industry directories (e.g., European Fund Industry Directory), and company proxies and annual reports.  \n\nWe use the historical filings of the FactSet /LionShares database from January 2000 through December 2005. We consider all types of stock holdings: ordinary shares, preferred shares, American Depositary Receipts (ADR), Global Depositary Receipts (GDR), and dual listings. We handle the issue of different reporting frequency by institutions from different countries by getting the latest holdings update at each year-end.6 The data cover institutions located in 27 different countries ( $K$ ) and stock holdings from 48 destination countries′ stock markets ( $J$ ).7 This data set offers a unique worldwide $K\\times J$ panel data (when aggregated at the country-level) for each year over the 2000-2005 period. FactSet/LionShares provides holdings data for 5,337 different institutions in over 35,000 stocks worldwide, for a total marketvalue ofUS $\\mathbb{S}$ 18 trillion as of December 2005.  \n\nTable A.1 in Appendix A presents equity assets held by institutions domiciled in each country at the end of each year. U.S.-based institutions are by far the largest group of professional managers of equity assets. Table A.1 shows the top five institutions by equity assets under management per country as of December 2005. Some of the leading institutions are fund families such as Barclays Global Investors, Capital Research and Management, and Vanguard in the U.S. Other institutions are divisions of banks (e.g., Dresdner Bank in Germany, Credit Agricole in France, UBS in Switzerland), and insurance companies (e.g.,. AXA in France), and pension funds (e.g., Canada Pension Plan, or Norway's State Petroleum Fund managed by Norges Bank).  \n\nTable A.2 presents the data in matrix form to summarize the holdings by country of origin of the institution (the rows) and the destination stock market country (the columns). Institutions covered by FactSet /LionShares as a whole manage a total of US\\$ 18 trillion of equity assets of which US\\$ 5.2 trillion represents holdings in non-U.S. stocks in December 2005 (i.e., excluding the first column in the matrix - the U.S. as destination market). Focusing on all non-U.S. destination stock markets, we find that domestic institutional investors with a market value of holdings of US $\\mathbb{S}$ 1.5 trillion (the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix) are nearly on an equal footing with U.s. institutions that hold US $\\$1$ 2 trillion (the sum of the elements in the first row of the matrix) and non-U.S. foreign institutions with US\\$ 1.7 trillion (the sum of the off-diagonal elements). Thus, in aggregate, non-U.S. frms across the world attract money from three institutional investor clienteles with similar pools of assets.  \n\nPanel A of Table A.3 shows the fraction of each country's stock market capitalization that was held by institutions in December 2005. Overall, according to FactSet /LionShares, institutional stock ownership accounts for 38.5% of world stock market capitalization. As expected, institutional ownership is the highest in the U.S., but global institutional portfolio managers also hold large fractions of stock markets in countries such as Canada and Sweden. But not all stock issued by corporations can be held by institutions, as a significant fraction is closely held by large shareholders in some countries (Dahlquist, Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson (2003)). Panel B of Table A.3. shows that institutional stock ownership accounts for 49.9% of the world stock market foat (market capitalization times one minus the percentage of closely held shares).  \n\nTo our knowledge, FactSet /LionShares data have been used previously only by Li et al. (2006). However, in that study, the authors study only the determinants of institutional blockholdings (stakes greater than $5\\%$ ) at the country-level using a single year. To better understand both the comprehensiveness and the limitations of the FactSet /LionShares data coverage, we perform some comparisons using country-level aggregate statistics and alternative data sets.  \n\nFirst, the market value of equity holdings of US $\\mathbb{S}$ 18 trillion reported by FactSet /LionShares is somewhat lower than the total value of US $\\$1$ 20 trillion reported in IMF statistics.8 But FactSet /LionShares aggregate holdings are well above the holdings of the mutual funds segment as in Khorana et al. (2005) and Chan et al. (2005). There are, however, exceptions as in the case of Japan and other Asian countries, where the FactSet /LionShares coverage seems to be better for mutual funds than for other institutions such as pension funds, so the overall equity holdings are somewhat underestimated in our study.9  \n\nSecond, we analyze how representative are the cross-border equity holdings in FactSet/LionShares relative to aggregate statistics on cross-border equity holdings. The Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) conducted by the IMF provides the most comprehensive aggregate information on cross-border holdings, but includes equity holdings for all types of investors, institutional and retail alike. CPIS reports a total of US\\$ 2.6 trillion invested by U.S. investors overseas in non-U.S. firms versus US\\$ 4 trillion invested by other foreign non-U.S. investors in non-U.S. firms in 2004. The equivalent values in FactSet /LionShares are somewhat lower: US\\$ 2 trillion for U.S. investors, and US $\\$1$ 1.7 trillion for non-U.S. foreign investors in non-U.S. firms (see Table A.2.), which can be explained by the fact that FactSet /LionShares covers only the institutional segment. Also, given that institutions have a greater presence in the U.S. than in other countries, the FactSet /LionShares data reveals a U.S. bias.10  \n\nThird, Panel C of Table A.3 presents the domestic bias implicit in the FactSet /LionShares institutional holdings by country. The domestic bias (calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of the percentage invested domestically by institutions to the market weight of the domestic stock market in the world market) reported by FactSet /LionShares is close to the bias implied by the CPIS and Chan et al. (2005). For example, for U.S. investors, the domestic bias is 71.7% in FactSet /LionShares, close to the 70.5% for all U.S. investors in CPIS and 60.3% in Chan et al. (2005).  \n\n## 2.2. Institutional Ownership Measures  \n\nWe first define total institutional ownership $(I O\\_T O T A L)$ as the sum of the holdings of all institutions in a frm's stock divided by market capitalization at the end of each calendar year. We sum institutional positions in local and ADR shares. Following Gompers and Metrick (2001), we set institutional ownership variables to zero if a stock is not held by any institution in FactSet /LionShares.11  \n\nWe consider first the “colors” of institutional ownership according to the geographic origin of the institution:  \n\n· Domestic Institutional Ownership( $I O\\_D O M E S T I C)$ : Sum of the holdings of all institutions domiciled in the same country in which the stock is issued as a percentage of market capitalization. ● Foreign Institutional Ownership (IO_FOREIGN): Sum of the holdings of all institutions domiciled in a country different from the country the stock is issued in as a percentage of market capitalization. We split foreign institutional ownership into the percentage of shares held by U.S. domiciled institutions ( $I O\\_F O R E I G N\\_U S)$ and non-U.S. (foreign) domiciled institutions (IO _FOREIGN_NUS).  \n\nWe also consider the “colors\"” of institutional ownership according to the institution type. Following Chen et al. (2006), we classify institutions according to the potential for business ties to a corporation as independent versus grey institutions:12  \n\n· Independent Institutional Ownership $(I O\\_I N D E P)$ : Percentage of shares held by mutual fund managers and investment advisers. These institutions are more likely to collect information and face less regulatory restrictions or have fewer potential business relationships with the corporations they invest in. We anticipate this group to be more involved in monitoring corporate management. Brickley et al. (1988) call these institutions “pressure-resistant,” and Almazan et al. (2005) call them “active\".  \n\n· Grey Institutional Ownership $(I O\\_G R E Y)$ : Percentage of shares held by bank trusts, insurance companies, and other institutions (e.g., pension funds, endowments). The current or prospective business relationships of these types of institution with corporations tend to make this group more “pressure-sensitive\" with respect to corporate management. Alternatively, one can think of these groups of institutions as having higher monitoring costs. We anticipate this group to be more loyal to corporate management and thus to hold shares without reacting to management actions that are not in line with the interests of shareholders. Brickley et al. (1988) call these institutions \"pressure-sensitive\" and Almazan et al. (2005) call them “passive'\".  \n\nUsing these institutional ownership variables we explore the “colors” of investors (geographic or institutional type) in terms of their willingness to be more or less active in monitoring manager actions. We expect foreign and independent institutions to be better equipped to play a monitoring role or to take more activist stances.  \n\nTable A.3. offers aggregate statistics of institutional ownership by stock market. We can see that in most markets outside the U.S., foreign institutional holdings exceed those of domestic money managers. The presence of independent versus grey investors varies across countries. For example, foreign institutions matter more in France, while in Sweden domestic money managers hold a higher fraction of the market. The holdings of independent and grey managers are equally matched in both countries.  \n\nFor some insight into our institutional ownership measures consider the cases of the largest French (Total SA) and Swedish (Ericsson Telefon AB) companies in December 2005 and their top ten institutional investors:  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Total SA</td><td colspan=\"4\">Ericsson Telefon AB</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Market capitalization = US$154 billion</td><td colspan=\"4\">Market capitalization = US$51 billion</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Total institutional ownership = 48.4%</td><td colspan=\"4\">Total institutional ownership = 43.6%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Domestic = 11.5% ,Foreign = 36.8% (US = 14.6%)</td><td colspan=\"4\">Domestic = 19.9%, Foreign = 23.8% (US = 11.3%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Independent = 26.7%,Grey = 21.4%</td><td colspan=\"4\">Independent = 22.0%, Grey = 21.3%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Top 10 Institutions:</td><td colspan=\"4\">Top 10 Institutions:</td></tr><tr><td>Name (country code)</td><td>Type</td><td>Hold</td><td>Shares</td><td>Name (country code)</td><td>Type</td><td>Hold</td><td>Shares</td></tr><tr><td>Ecureuil Gestion (FR)</td><td>Inv Adv</td><td>1.9%</td><td>Local</td><td>Robur Fonder (SE)</td><td>Mut Fund</td><td>2.7%</td><td>Local</td></tr><tr><td>Fidelity (US)</td><td>Inv Adv</td><td>1.8%</td><td>ADR</td><td>Handelsbanken (SE)</td><td>Bank Tr</td><td>2.5%</td><td>Local</td></tr><tr><td>Crédit Agricole Mg (FR)</td><td>Bank Tr</td><td>1.8%</td><td>Local</td><td>NLocalea Inv Mg (SE)</td><td>Inv Adv</td><td>1.8%</td><td>Local</td></tr><tr><td>IXIS Asset (FR)</td><td>Mut Fund</td><td>1.7%</td><td>Local</td><td>Alecta Pensions (SE)</td><td>Pen Fund</td><td>1.6%</td><td>Local</td></tr><tr><td>Wellington (US)</td><td>Mut Fund</td><td>1.2%</td><td>ADR</td><td>SEB Invest.

Also, investors choose local shares or ADRs differently, even among U.S. institutions (like Fidelity versus Capital Research Management). Additionally, we can see that independent and grey institutions are equally important in Total SA and Ericsson Telefon AB.  \n\n## 2.3. Sample Construction and Summary Statistics  \n\nThe initial sample includes all firms in the Datastream/WorldScope (DS/WS) database excluding financial firms (SIC codes 6000-6999) for the years 2000 through 2005. We combine this sample of frms with the institutional holdings data from FactSet /LionShares at the end of each year using SEDOL codes (only for non-U.S. firms), CUSIP codes (only for U.S. firms), and ISIN codes. The firm-level stock market and financial data are drawn from DS/WS. We use several data sources to determine which non-U.S. firms are cross-listed in the U.S., when they initiated and ended the listing, and the type of listing (exchange-listed or non-exchange-listed).13 The final sample includes 11,224 unique non-U.S. frms, for a total of 38,064 firm-year observations for which we have data for the main variables of interest. Table B.1 in Appendix B details the definitions and data sources for all variables. Table 1 provides summary statistics on institutional ownership variables and firm- and country-level control variables (we winsorize financial ratios such as return on equity and leverage at the bottom and top 1% levels).  \n\nAverage total institutional ownership by domestic institutions is 7.4% for non-U.S. firms but this is an equally weighted average, and institutional ownership is higher among large firms (in the last row of Panel A of Table A.3, we can see that the value-weighted institutional ownership for the sample of non-U.S. frms is 19.1%). Furthermore, as discussed earlier, when we correct for shares that are closely held, total institutional ownership is 27.9% of market Hoat (Panel B of Table A.3). When we categorize total institutional ownership by the institution's geographic origin, we find that average (equal-weighted) domestic institutional ownership (3.8%) and foreign institutional ownership (3.6%) are similar. When we categorize total institutional ownership by institution type, we can see that ownership by independent institutions (5.0%) is greater, on average, than by grey institutions (2.4%).  \n\nThe average non-U.S. firm in the sample has a market capitalization of US\\$ 157 million, 14.9% are MSCI index members, and 3.9% are cross-listed on a U.S. exchange. About 27% of the observations are from English-speaking countries.  \n\n# 3. Determinants of Institutional Ownership  \n\nWe investigate the determinants of institutional ownership worldwide, in particular, the fraction held by different institution groups. First we examine the preferences of domestic versus foreign institutions. Then we examine the preferences of independent versus grey institutions. Finally, we conduct several robustness checks and consider extensions of our primary results.  \n\n## 3.1. What Attracts Foreign and Domestic Institutions?  \n\nWe start by examining which firm- and country-level characteristics drive foreign versus domestic institutional ownership in non-U.S. frms. Table 2 presents the estimates of the institutional ownership panel regressions: total, foreign (divided into U.S.-based and nonU.S.-based), and domestic. We estimate two specifications: (1) with firm- and country-level variables; (2) with firm-level variables and country fixed effects.14 For total institutional ownership, we also run a first specification in Table 2 with only firm-level variables which exhibits a high $R^{2}$ , suggesting that firm-level characteristics explains considerable part of variation in institutional ownership. We also run standardized regressions as in Bennett et al. (2003) to identify the crucial determinants of institutional ownership in a firm (see Panel A of Table 4).  \n\nThe results in Table 2 show that institutional investors around the world, whether foreign or domestic, share many common preferences on their stock investments. The major common drivers of institutional ownership are $S I Z E$ and $C L O S E$ . All institutional money managers have a strong preference for the stock of large firms ( $S I Z E$ ). This is consistent with findings in Falkenstein (1996) and Gompers and Metrick (2001) for the U.S. market and in Dahlquist and Robertsson (2001) for the Swedish market. Firm size is an important factor in international investment because institutions have concerns as to liquidity and transaction costs. An increase by one standard deviation of firm size (i.e., an increase from US\\$ 157 million to US\\$1.1 billion for the average market capitalization) is associated with an increase in total institutional ownership by roughly 2.5 percentage points. All institutional investors hold fewer shares of firms that are closely held or with concentrated control rights $(C L O S E$ 0. Leuz et al. (2005) and Doidge, Karolyi, Lins, Miller, and Stulz (2006a) find that U.S. institutions invest less in poorly governed frms, namely, frms with large block ownership by insiders (e.g., managers and families).  \n\nThere are also common investment preferences among different groups of institutions in terms of other stock characteristics. For example, all institutions have a tendency to invest in companies with investment opportunities and proven profitability ( $I N V O P$ and $R O E$ ), consistent with the “prudent man\" rules that professional money managers are likely to follow (Del Guercio (1996)). Contrary to the predictions of the “prudent man\" rules, however, institutional ownership is higher for high idiosyncratic volatility stocks (SIGM A). Gompers and Metrick (2001) also find that money managers in the U.S. do not particularly avoid high-risk stocks.15  \n\nBut the three different groups of managers display diverse investment preferences in terms of other stock characteristics. Institutions′ preferences diverge mainly on two factors: M SCI and $A D R$ . Both U.S. and other foreign investors have a bias for companies in the MSCI World index, the leading index used in international asset management as shown by the positive MSCI coefficient. Index membership matters as foreign institutional ownership is roughly four percentage points higher for MSCI frms. The negative $M S C I$ coefficient for domestic institutions indicates that this investor group fills the void in non-MSCI stocks. Additionally, foreign investors prefer to invest in cross-listed firms. The positive $A D R$ COefficient for both U.S. and non-U.S. foreign institutional investors illustrates the positive effect of cross-listing on a U.S. exchange.16 Foreign institutional ownership is roughly six percentage points higher for frms with a U.S. cross-listing. When they invest domestically, institutions do not seem to prefer cross-listing firms. This finding is consistent with the results in Ammer et al. (2005) for U.S. investors. In untabulated regressions, we control for selection bias (i.e., firms with higher foreign ownership are more likely to cross-list in the frst place), and find that the positive relation between cross-listing and foreign ownership  \n\nis robust.17  \n\nIn a simple but more direct attempt to isolate the cross-listing effect, we identify the 118 firms that cross-listed on a U.S. exchange during the 2000-2005 period. We conduct an event study to compare the level of institutional ownership around the cross-listing date. Figure 1 shows that firms that cross-list experience an increase in their median foreign institutional ownership from about 4.2% one year prior to the listing to over 8.3% two years after or 12.1% three years after. The increase in foreign holdings occurs both in ADR and local shares. For example, holdings by U.S. institutions rise on median from 1.7% to 3.2% in local shares and from 0% to 2% in ADRs (from one quarter prior to the listing to three years after). Even though not all trading is retained by the U.S. exchanges, more foreign investors invest directly in the firm's home market. This speaks to the fow-back phenomenon in cross-listings, i.e. after an initial blip in U.S. trading, trading moves back to the domestic exchange (Karolyi (2003) and Halling, Pagano, Randl, and Zechner (2007)). Overall, cross-listing seems to be associated with higher ownership by U.S. and non-U.S. institutions.  \n\nThe three different groups of managers also display diverse investment preferences in terms of other stock characteristics. U.S. institutions have a preference for value stocks (high $B M$ ). Gompers and Metrick (2001) find weak evidence (although strengthening evidence over their sample period) that U.S. institutions favor value stocks, possibly to exploit the value anomaly. Our result shows that U.S. institutions also pursue such an investment strategy internationally. Foreign institutions are also prone to chase stocks with recent positive stock return performance $R E T$ ) and domestic investors seem to exhibit a contrarian behavior. This is consistent with some ideas that foreign institutions represent hot money chasing hot markets (Tesar and Werner (1995), Bohn and Tesar (1996), and Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000)). Furthermore, domestic institutions prefer high dividend-paying stocks $(D I V)$ , but foreign institutions seem to avoid them, perhaps because of tax withholding concerns (Dahlquist and Robertsson (2001) and Ammer et al. (2005)). Gompers and Metrick (2001) find that U.S. mutual funds seem averse to stocks with high dividend yields.  \n\nFinally, we look at country-level variables. All institutions reveal a preference for stocks from countries with good disclosure standards ( $D I S C$ ). Investors prefer stocks from countries that are physically closer to their local market (DISTANCE). U.S. institutions show a clear preference for English-speaking countries (ENGLISH) and less developed markets $(M C A P$ ), while non-U.S. institutions reveal the opposite. These findings illustrate that groups of institutional investors have different reasons for investing abroad. The quality of a country's legal environment $(L E G A L$ ) is positively related to the presence of domestic institutional investors, but we find the opposite result with respect to attracting foreign institutions. This is contrary to what the law and finance literature would suggest (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998)). Our interpretation is that the investor's decision to invest abroad balances weak shareholder protection against strong investment prospects or diversification benefits. This argument may explain why U.S. investors seem to prefer emerging markets over European markets when investing overseas.  \n\n## 3.2. What Attracts Independent and Grey Institutions?  \n\nWe now examine the revealed preferences of different types of institutions, particularly independent institutions (mutual funds and investment advisers) versus grey institutions (bank trusts, insurance companies, and others). Different types of institutions are subject to distinct investment mandates and regulations. This may cause them to prefer investing in stocks that most help them satisfy investment constraints such as the “prudent man\" rules (Del Guercio (1996)).  \n\nTable 3 presents estimates of the determinants of institutional ownership by institution type. In aggregate, independent and grey institutional investors share many common investment preferences. They have a strong preference for large firms and visible firms (U.S.  \n\ncross-listed and MSCI members), and firms with strong corporate governance indicators (widely held). When we run standardized regressions (see Panel A of Table 4), we find that SIZE, MSCI, and $C L O S E$ and are the most important common factors driving institutional ownership.  \n\nThere is, however, some variation in investment preferences of different types of institutions. Independent institutions are present more in liquid stocks (TURN), while grey institutions seem to shy away from these stocks. This speaks to the liquidity versus monitoring trade-off that large investors face (e.g. Kahn and Winton (1998)). Our results indicate a complementary relation in that activist shareholders prefer easily traded shares from which they can pull out more quickly. Independent institutions also invest more in stocks with recent positive stock return performance, while grey institutions (especially insurance companies) seem to exhibit contrarian behavior. Insurance companies are the least sensitive to MSCI membership and U.S. cross-listing. Finally, we find more ownership by independent institutions in countries with a strong legal environment $(L E G A L$ ), but less ownership by grey institutions (especially bank trusts).  \n\n## 3.3. Robustness Checks and Additional Tests  \n\nTable 4 presents several robustness checks and extensions of our primary results on investment preferences. Panel A of Table 4 presents the standardized regressions coefficients, which give an indication of the importance of each variable for institutional ownership, as discussed above.18  \n\nThe presence of cross-sectional dependence is a potential concern with panel regression results. Our results so far account for time series and cross-sectional dependence using firm clustered standard errors and year dummies, as suggested by Petersen (2006). An alternative solution is to use the Fama-MacBeth procedure estimating a separate regression for each cross-section and then taking the time series mean of the coefficients. Panel B of Table 4 shows that our results are robust to this procedure.  \n\nOur results are also robust in other ways. In the interest of brevity, in untabulated regressions, we consider: (1) institutional ownership measured as a fraction of market foat (instead of market capitalization); (2) the potential censoring of the dependent variable by estimating a Tobit model, as a considerable number of firms have zero institutional ownership; (3) a sample of firms of only the 27 countries that have institutions domiciled locally in our data set; (4) the ratio of the stock weight in the institutions′ portfolio relative to the stock weight in the market portfolio to see which firms are over- and under-weighted by investors; (5) a sample of frms that only have positive institutional holdings; and (6) industry dummies or standard errors clustered by country. Finally, as a benchmark exercise, we consider the determinants of institutional investment in U.S. stocks (instead of non-U.S. stocks). Our results match earlier findings by Gompers and Metrick (2001). Like these authors, we find a preference for large, liquid, and value stocks.  \n\nPanel C of Table 4 extends the results on institutional investor preferences in terms of the firm's external visibility. We address the role of a firm's visibility in more detail by adding as an explanatory variable the number of analysts covering a firm (ANALY ST S), a proxy for the level of information available to investors (Baker, Nofsinger, and Weaver (2002)), and the percentage of foreign sales $(F X S A L E S)$ , a proxy for “name value” abroad. We find that the frm's visibility serves to attract more foreign investment by institutions, but not domestic investment. Independent and grey institutions are both attracted by firm visibility.  \n\nPanel D of Table 4 examines how sensitive institutional money managers are to countrylevel governance, particularly the quality of legal institutions and enforcement (LEGAL). The results indicate that all institutional investors pay special attention to firm-level characteristics (in particular those related with firm-level governance such as $A D R$ and $C L O S E$ when they decide to invest abroad in countries with weak investor protection environments (i.e., countries with low scores for the variable). The interaction $A D R\\times L E G A L$ variable has a negative and significant coefficient, implying less of a preference by foreign institutions for U.S. cross-listing stocks if the firm is originally from a country with strong investor protection. The interaction $C L O S E\\times L E G A L$ variable is negative and significant, so institutions seem to avoid more closely held firms when these firms are located in countries with weak legal environments.  \n\n# 4. Institutional Ownership and Firm Performance  \n\nWe want to investigate the relation between institutional ownership and firm performance for non-U.S. firms in order to understand the role institutional investors play in monitoring and infuencing management decisions. Following Gompers, Ishi, and Metrick (2003) on the impact of corporate governance on firm performance, we first test the effect of institutional ownership on firm valuation.19 The hypothesis is that foreign and independent institutional ownership is associated with higher firm value, as these institutions play a monitoring role. Then we check whether foreign and independent institutional ownership also has an infuence on firms? operating performance and capital expenditures.  \n\n## 4.1. Impact on Firm Value  \n\nTo investigate the relation between institutional ownership and firm value, we adopt Tobin's $Q$ as a measure of firm value, calculated as the book value of total assets plus the market value of equity minus the book value of equity divided by total assets (see Gompers et al. (2003) and Doidge et al. (2004)).  \n\nWe estimate regressions of a firm's Tobin's $Q$ on variables associated with firm value such as $S I Z E$ , growth opportunities $(I N V O P$ ), leverage $\\mathrm{~\\it~LEV)}$ , cash holdings $(C A S H$ ), crosslisting ( $A D R)$ , and median Tobin's $Q$ for the firm's global industry following Doidge et al.  \n\n(2004). We also include country-level variables that are usually considered in the literature.   \nMost important, we include the institutional ownership variables that are our focus: total;   \nforeign and domestic; and independent and grey institutional ownership.  \n\nIt is well known that Tobin's $Q$ is an imperfect measure of firm value. Gompers, Ishi, and Metrick (2006) point out several problems with using ordinary least squares (OLS) pooled cross-sectional and time series regressions. A first problem is that $Q$ is estimated with error. To alleviate this problem, we follow Gompers et al. (2006) in using median regressions and two alternative transformations of $Q$ $\\log(Q)$ and $-1/Q$ . A second problem is crosssectional dependence across firms in a given year. We address this issue by using standard errors adjusted for clustering at the firm-level. A third problem is that errors are correlated across time for a given frm (time series dependence). We address this issue by including year dummies in our panel regressions (Petersen (2006)). In robustness tests, we also run Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions as an alternative procedure. A final problem is the endogeneity of institutional holdings. This is particularly true in our context, given that we have reported results on what drives institutional investor ownership (see Section 3). We handle the potential endogeneity issue that firm valuation and institutional ownership are jointly determined in a system of simultaneous equations for ownership and firm's valuation using three-stage least squares.  \n\nTable 5 presents the estimates of the median panel regressions for Tobin's $Q$ for the sample of non-U.S. firms located in countries with institutions domiciled locally.20 We find a positive and significant relation between total institutional ownership and firm value in column (1). The $I O\\_T O T A L$ coefficient is positive and statistically significant. McConnell and Servaes (1990) also find a positive effect of institutional equity ownership for U.S. frms. In columns (2)-(4) we disentangle the effects in terms of foreign and domestic institutional ownership. In column (2), we find that foreign institutions (IO _FOREIGN) have a positive and significant effect on firm value, but in column (3) there is no evidence that more domestic institutional ownership is associated with higher firm value. Column (4) includes both foreign and domestic institutional ownership as determinants of firm value, where we see that foreign institutional ownership remains positive and significant. These results hint at the valueenhancing role of foreign investors for corporations worldwide. Next, in columns (5)-(7) we find that independent institutional ownership $(I O\\_I N D E P)$ is associated with higher firm value, while grey institutional ownership is insignificantly related to firm value.  \n\nThe magnitudes of the coefficients also indicate that the effects are economically signifcant. The coefficient on $I O\\_F O R E I G N$ in column (4) indicates that a ten percentage point increase in institutional ownership is associated with an increase in $Q$ by 0.039 (roughly 3% of the average Tobin's $Q$ ). The coefficient on $I O_{-}I N D E P$ in column (7) indicates that a ten percentage point increase in institutional ownership is associated with an increase in $Q$ by 0.021 (roughly 2% of the average Tobin's $Q$ ). Overall, our results suggest that only foreign and independent institutions (with potential fewer business ties to firms) seem to be associated with a valuation premium.  \n\nOur results offer a direct link between foreign institutional shareholder presence and firm value. Other studies have identified cross-listing on a U.S. exchange as having unique governance and bonding benefits and thereby reducing firms′ cost of capital (Doidge et al. (2004) and Doidge et al. (2007)). When we control for institutional ownership, however, we do not find support for a direct cross-listing valuation premium. This finding is not, however, inconsistent with the bonding hypothesis as institutional ownership increases following crosslisting in particular by those institutions involved in monitoring such as foreign institutions (see Figure 1). Institutional ownership may explain in part the premium and governance benefits for non-U.S. firms that list on a U.S. exchange.?21 Thus, we interpret these positive valuation effect as a form of reputational bonding (Coffe (2002) and Stulz (1999) stemming from monitoring by highly reputable institutions, rather than the legal bonding associated with a U.S. cross-listing. Other control variable coeffcients are in general consistent with previous findings: large firms, cash-rich frms, firms with investment opportunities, and more levered firms have higher valuations.  \n\nTable 6 presents several robustness checks of the relation between firm value and institutional ownership. Panels A and B use OLS regressions for $\\log(Q)$ and $-1/Q$ to address the potential measurement error of $Q$ . We also estimate standard errors adjusted for frm-level clustering to correct for the fact that errors are unlikely to be independent across time and include year dummies (Petersen (2006)). Panel C uses Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional OLS regressions (dependent variable is $\\log(Q)$ ) to take into account that errors are not independent across frms.22 In each panel we include three specifications in terms of institutional ownership variables: total; foreign and domestic; independent and grey.  \n\nThe results in Panels A-C are consistent with our primary fnding of a positive relation between frm value and foreign and independent institutional ownership. In contrast to Table 5, however, we do not find a positive relation between total institutional ownership and firm value. The evidence points toward the possibility that monitoring efforts come mainly from foreign and independent institutions, rather than all institutions. Indeed, the relation between firm value and domestic and grey institutional ownership is either insignificant or negative.  \n\nfirm (i.e. how a unit of sales growth impacts firm value). We find that indeed the coefficients of the interaction variables of $I N V O P$ with IO_FOREIGN and $\\begin{array}{l l}{I O}&{I N D E P}\\end{array}$ are positive and significant. This is consistent with the idea that the monitoring effects of foreign and independent institutions are stronger in frms with strong investment opportunities. The coefficients of $I O\\_F O R E I G N$ and $I O_{-}I N D E P$ remain positive and significant.  \n\nOne important concern is that institutional ownership is likely to be jointly determined with firm value and driven by similar firm and country characteristics. Given our results on the determinants of institutional investment (see Section 3), the issue is the direction of a causal relation between institutional ownership and firm value. For example, do foreign institutions prompt governance improvements in frms, or do firms with better governance attract more foreign capital? Which way does the causality run?  \n\nTo address this issue, we re-estimate the Tobin's $Q$ and institutional ownership regressions as a system of simultaneous equations.23 Identification is achieved by the independent variables included in the institutional ownership equation that are not related to Tobin's $Q$ particularly MSCI membership, dividend yield, and idiosyncratic volatility. For example, the inclusion of a stock in the MSCI index drives up foreign ownership, but it is not likely to directly affect firm value.24  \n\nTable 7 reports the results of three-stage least squares (3SLS) regressions of a system of simultaneous equations for $\\log(Q)$ and each institutional ownership variable one at a time. We find that the positive effect of foreign and independent institutional ownership on Tobin's $Q$ ratios is robust to endogeneity concerns. Overall, the results using 3SLS corroborate the findings in Tables 5 and 6 with respect to the positive impact on firm value of foreign and independent institutional investors (IO_FOREIGN and $I O\\_I N D E P)$ . It is worth noting that we do not find the same result of institutions positively affecting firm valuations (in Panel  \n\nE) for holdings by grey institutions. Only “pressure-insensitive'\" institutions successfully exert direct monitoring (through intervention or “voice\"） or indirect (exiting or “voting with One's fet'\").  \n\nOur firm valuation results are robust in other ways. In untabulated regressions, we also consider: (1) a sample of firms only that have positive institutional holdings; (2) standard errors clustered by country or country random effects regressions; and (3) industry-adjusted Tobin's $Q$ computedas $Q$ minus its industry median.  \n\n## 4.2. Impact on Operating Performance and Capital Expenditures  \n\nWe have presented evidence in support of the hypothesis that foreign and independent institutions (but not all institutions) have a positive effect on firm value because these institutions act as monitors. An alternative interpretation of these findings is that the presence of foreign and independent investors′ pushes the stock prices up at least temporarily if the market is not very liquid. To distinguish the monitoring interpretation from the overvaluation effect, we now test whether institutional presence is related to measures of firms’ operating performance. We wish to see if indeed foreign and independent institutional investors positively infuence how a firm is run as captured by non-stock market measures of firm profitability. This should happen only under the monitoring hypothesis.  \n\nPanels A and B of Table 8 present the results of median regressions of two profitability measures: return on assets ( $R O A$ )and net profit margin $^{\\prime}N P M$ ) following Gompers et al. (2003). We control for firm characteristics such as size and book-to-market and include industry and year dummies. The results support a positive relation between institutional ownership and firms’ operating performance. As with the results for Tobin's $Q$ ,the relation between foreign and independent institutions and operating performance is positive and significant, while for domestic and grey institutional ownership the relation tends to be insignificant. This finding supports our interpretation that foreign and independent institutions are effective at monitoring corporate managers.  \n\nWe also investigate whether institutional monitoring effectively reduces agency costs by curtailing managers? tendency to overinvest (Jensen (1986)), i.e. undertake negative net present value projects to extract private benefits. Indeed, capital expenditures represent an important managerial decision that is likely to capture investors' attention. To test this idea, we estimate median panel regressions of capital expenditures $(C A P E X$ on our institutional ownership variables. Results are in Panel C of Table 8. There is a negative relation between institutional ownership and capital expenditures, but a significant and negative relation only in the case of foreign and independent institutions, which gives further support to the monitoring interpretation of our findings. Domestic and grey institutions, however, do not seem to mitigate management's tendency to overinvest.25  \n\nThe magnitudes of the coefficients indicate that the effects on operating performance are economically significant. The coefficients on $I O\\_F O R E I G N$ and $I O_{-}I N D E P$ indicate that a ten percentage points increase in institutional ownership is associated with an increase in $R O A$ of roughly 8% relative to the sample mean. The effect on capital expenditures is also economically significant as a ten percentage points increase in $I O\\_F O R E I G N$ or $\\begin{array}{l l}{I O}&{I N D E P}\\end{array}$ is associated with a decrease in $C A P E X$ of roughly 2% relative to the sample mean.  \n\nOverall, we find that the presence of foreign and independent institutions as shareholders has a positive impact on firm value and operating performance. Through their monitoring efforts, these groups of institutions seem able to reduce any tendency toward overinvestment. The same cannot be said for domestic and grey institutions; they do not have the same impact on firm performance and investment policy. Thus, we are confident that our results are not spurious and we can conclude that institutions with fewer business ties to firms are a powerful force in monitoring corporations around the world.  \n\n# 5. Conclusion  \n\nWe use a comprehensive database of equity holdings over the 2000-2005 period to investigate the role of institutional investors around the world. Focusing on non-U.S. firms, we document that institutions are becoming prominent shareholders in companies worldwide. Investments by foreign institutions exceed those of domestic institutions in some markets. Foreign capital is not of a single “color,” in that U.S. and non-U.S. foreign institutions control comparable pools of capital.  \n\nWe offer a global view of what attracts international institutions to invest in corporations around the world. We find that all institutional investors seek large frms and firms with strong governance indicators, but foreigners overweight firms in the MSCI index and firms cross-listed on a U.S. exchange. Some country-level factors are relevant (e.g., all investors prefer countries with strict disclosure standards), but a significant part of the cross-sectional variation in institutional holdings is explained by firm-level characteristics. This suggests that institutional money actively selects the frms to invest in, beyond just following countrylevel allocations. These findings support a substitution role, rather than a complementary role, for firm-level and country-level mechanisms at least in institutional investors’ portfolio decisions. This gives additional insights into research showing that firm-level governance levels are in large part driven by country characteristics (Stulz (2005) and Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2006b)). Our findings suggest that investors do track firm-level governance indicators, and there is some hope for a “good firm\" in a “bad\" country.  \n\nOur findings suggest that some (but not all) institution groups are effective monitors of the firms they invest in. The presence of foreign and independent institutions enhances shareholder value. These institutions are able to exert pressure because they have fewer business relations with the frm to jeopardize, unlike domestic or grey institutions. Our tests show that firms held by foreign and independent institutions have higher valuations; there is no similar evidence for ownership by domestic and grey institutions. We also document that foreign and independent institutions are associated with better operating performance and reduced capital expenditures. These results are robust in several ways, including the potential endogeneity of institutional ownership. This positive performance effect is indicative of a form of reputational bonding that stems from firms associating with large and independent institutional investors.  \n\nAs foreign and independent institutional investors are increasingly playing an important governance role in corporations around the world, we believe it is worth exploring in more depth the particular ways they exert their influence. In this paper we examine outcomes (Tobin's $Q$ , return on assets, net profit margin, capital expenditures) rather than direct corporate choices (research and development expenditures, mergers and acquisitions decisions, CEO turnover and compensation). Institutional shareholders can push for change by directly voicing their interests to corporate management, or indirectly, by infuencing managers’ actions by exiting (the “\"Wall Street walk\"). It would be interesting to look at the impact institutional investors have on changes in corporate governance practices in frms around the world as well as their role in specific corporate events.  \n\n# References  \n\nAdmati, Anat, and Paul Pfeiderer, 2006, The \"Wall Street Walk\" as a form of shareholder activism, working paper, Stanford Graduate School of Business.  \n\nAggarwal, Reena, Leora Klapper, and Peter Wysocki, 2005, Portfolio preferences of foreign institutional investors, Journal of Banking and Finance 29, 2919-2946.  \n\nAlmazan, Andres, Jay Hartzell, and Laura Starks, 2005, Active institutional shareholders and cost of monitoring: Evidence from executive compensation, Financial Management 34,5-34.  \n\nAmmer, John, Sara Holland, David Smith, and Francis Warnock, 2005, Look at me now: What attracts U.S. shareholders?, working paper, Federal Reserve Board of Governors.   \nBaker, H.

 \n\n# Table 4 Determinants of Institutional Ownership: Robustness and Additional Tests  \n\nThis table reports estimates of coeffcients of the annual time-series cross-sectional firm-level regression of total institutional ownership, foreign institutional ownership, domestic institutional ownership, ownership by independent institutions (mutual funds and independent investment advisers), and ownership by grey institutions (bank trusts, insurance companies and other institutions) as a percentage of market capitalization for non-U.S. frms. Panel A reports estimates of standardized regressions. Panel B reports estimates using the Fama-MacBeth estimation procedure. Panels C and D report estimates using additional explanatory variables. The firm-level regressors include log market capitalization $(S I Z E)$ , log book-to-market equity ratio $(B M)$ , investment opportunities $(I N V O P)$ , stock return $(R E T)$ , turnover $\\scriptstyle(T U R N)$ , dividend yield $(D Y)$ , return on equity $(R O E)$ , idiosyncratic variance $S I G M A$ ),MSCI index membership dummy $(M S C I)$ , leverage $(L E V)$ , cash holdings $\\left(C A S H\\right)$ , closely held shares ( $C L O S E$ ，ADR exchange-listed dummy $(A D R)$ , analyst coverage $.A N A L Y S T S)$ , and foreign sales $(F X S A L E S)$ . The country-level regressors include legal regime index $,L E G A L)$ , disclosure index $(D I S C)$ , log average geographic distance ${}D I S T A N C E_{,}$ , English language dummy $(E N G L I S H)$ , log GDP per capita $(G D P)$ andmarket capitalization to GDP $(M C A P)$ . Refer to Table B.1 in Appendix B for variable definitions. The sample period is from 2000 to 2005. Financial frms are omitted (SIC 6000-6999). The robust $t$ statistics in parentheses are adjusted for clustering at the firm-level. Coefficients significant at the $5\\%$ level are in boldface.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Panel A:Standardized Regressions</td><td colspan=\"5\">PanelB:Fama-MacBeth</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total Inst.</td><td>Foreign Inst.</td><td>Domestic Inst.</td><td>Indep.

Median Institutional Ownership Around Cross-Listing. This figure plots median institutional ownership in local and ADRs shares as a percentage of market capitalization using a sample of 118 cross-listings on U.S. exchanges from 2000 to 2005. The areas give institutional ownership by (from bottom to top) of domestic institutions in local shares ( $2.2\\%$ three years after listing), U.S. institutions in local shares (2% three years after listing), U.S. institutions in ADRs ( $2.2\\%$ three years after listing), non-U.S. foreign institutions in local shares (4.6% three years after listing), and non-U.S. foreign institutions in ADRs (0.4% three years after listing). Domestic institutions holdings in ADRs are insignificant so they are not shown in the figure.  \n\n# Appendix A.

Consistent with this argument, we find that abnormal net hiring, measured as the absolute deviation from optimal net hiring predicted by economic fundamentals, decreases in the presence of institutional investors with longer investment horizons. Firms dominated by long-term shareholders reduce both over-investment (over-hiring and under-firing) and underinvestment (under-hiring) in employees. The monitoring role of long-term investors is stronger for firms facing higher labor adjustment costs both in absolute terms and relative to capital adjustment costs, and those for which human capital is regarded as more important. The effect is also more pronounced for firms that have stronger incentives and/or more opportunities to deviate from expected net hiring. We address endogeneity concerns by exploiting exogenous changes to long-term institutional ownership resulting from annual reconstitutions of the Russell indexes.  \n\nJEL Classifications: G23, G32, G34, M51.  \n\nKeywords: Institutional ownership, Investment horizon, Employment, Investment efficiency, Corporate governance, Monitoring.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nRecent research has underscored the importance of corporate employment decisions, particularly the need for firms to maintain optimal investment in employees (Pinnuck and Lillis, 2007; Falato and Liang, 2016; Ellul et al., 2018). Divergence from optimal labor investment is costly to a firm since it leads to over-capacity problems, and thus lower productivity, in the case of over-investment, or insufficient growth in the case of underinvestment (Williamson, 1963; Stein, 1989). These problems are likely to be more acute in modern firms since they are more human-capital intensive (Pfeffer, 1996; Zingales, 2000) and invest heavily in labor. Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggests that shareholders, and particularly institutional investors, appreciate the importance of labor investments. For example, a coalition of institutional investors with over $\\$2.8$ trillion under management recently petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to introduce rules requiring firms to enhance disclosure on their human capital management policies.2 Also, BlackRock publishes an annual report detailing its approach to engagement on human capital management, which lists voluntary and involuntary turnover as well as employee tenure as topics it covers when engaging with the management teams of firms in its portfolio.? In this paper, we study whether monitoring, or even the threat of monitoring, by institutional investors, particularly those with long investment horizons, mitigates agency conflicts associated with employment decisions and thus reduces labor investment inefficiency.  \n\nAn important factor that should affect the willingness of an institutional investor to engage in monitoring is the time horizon of his/her investment. Institutional shareholders can vary in their investment horizons because of differences in their trading strategies and/or the maturities of their liabilities. Many hedge funds and open-ended mutual funds, for example, are short term as a result of their trading strategies and their high liquidity needs, whereas pension funds and insurance companies usually have long horizons because of the longer maturities of their liabilities (Yan and Zhang, 2009; Derrien et al., 2013). As in Gaspar et al. (2005) and Chen et al. (2007), we argue that long-term investors enjoy economies of scale in collecting and processing corporate information. These investors have lower monitoring cost functions since they build firm- and manager-specific knowledge over time. This knowledge helps them benefit from monitoring by increasing their ability to influence managers, as well as enhancing the quality of the information they collect, which could be used to inform future trading decisions (Chen et al., 2007). This argument is in line with McCahery et al.'s (2016) survey evidence on the importance of investment horizons in explaining institutional investors? engagement with their portfolio firms. Therefore, we frame the underlying conflict under investigation as an agency problem between managers and long-term shareholders.  \n\nInefficiencies in human-capital investments can take the form of over- and/or underinvestment in labor. Over-investment in labor takes place when agency conflicts lead selfinterested managers to engage in over-hiring activities as part of their empire-building agendas. Williamson (1963) specifically uses the expansion of staff numbers beyond optimal levels as an example of managers? opportunistic behavior aimed at gaining more security and power. Over-investment in labor also occurs when managers decide to retain (under-fire) poorly performing employees as a mutually beneficial arrangement. Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) show that managers may be reluctant to trim an unproductive workforce because of their preference for the quiet life and their desire to avoid the difficult decisions and costly effort associated with downsizing. Pagano and Volpin (2005) demonstrate that top managers facing potential dismissal for poor performance may form an alliance with the workforce by abstaining from worker layoffs and wage cuts. Workers, in return, may help retain such managers if they have sufficient power to affect such decisions. Similarly, Atanassov and Kim (2009) show that weak investor protection combined with strong union laws leads to workermanagement alliances, in which poorly performing firms sell assets to prevent large-scale layoffs, garnering worker support for retaining the management. Landier et al. (2009) find that firms in the U.S. are less likely to lay off workers located geographically closer to the corporate headquarters, and that this behavior may, in part, reflect private benefits to CEOs that come from interacting with workers and communities close to the corporate headquarters.  \n\nUnder-investment in labor, on the other hand, occurs when pressure from outside investors leads managers to over-fire underperforming employees or to under-hire to meet earnings targets. As stressed by Narayanan (1985), Stein (1989), Froot et al. (1992), Porter (1992), and Von Thadden (1995), myopic pressures from outside investors can result in managers turning down valuable investment opportunities due to concerns over the firm's short-term stock price. Therefore, a manager concerned with short-term results can end up under-investing in labor out of fear that such investments would depress earnings and adversely affect stock prices (Porter, 1992; Bushee, 1998). Empirical evidence produced by Graham et al. (2005) reports that a significant number of managers are willing to give up projects that will be profitable in the long run to meet short-run earnings targets. Of most relevance to our context is their finding that firms can postpone or eliminate hiring to avoid missing earnings targets.  \n\nMotivated by the abundant evidence on the agency conflicts associated with labor investments, we argue that the existence of long-term institutional investors in a firm's ownership structure can help mitigate these conflicts. We hypothesize that, in firms with longer investor horizons, direct monitoring or the threat of monitoring by long-term investors should result in fewer sub-optimal investments in employees.  \n\nTo capture the investment horizon of a firm's shareholders, we follow the literature (Gaspar et al., 2005; Yan and Zhang, 2009; Cella et al., 2013) and measure the investment horizon of each institutional shareholder using his/her portfolio turnover level. We then aggregate individual turnover rates within each firm to get the (weighted) average portfolio turnover rate of all institutional investors with positive shareholdings in the firm. To ensure that higher values of our horizon proxy correspond to a longer investment horizon and to simplify the interpretation of our results, we multiply the investor turnover measure by -1. We call this proxy Investor_Stability and use it in subsequent analysis to study how the investment horizon of a firm's institutional shareholders affects the efficiency of its labor investments.  \n\nBased on the economics literature (e.g., Hamermesh, 1989) and recent empirical studies in accounting and finance (e.g., Pinnuck and Lillis, 2007; Ellul et al., 2018; Benmelech et al., 2019), we use firms′ net hiring (i.e., the percentage change in the number of employees) to proxy for their investment in labor. We measure investment inefficiencies as the absolute deviation of actual net hiring from its expected (optimal) level, predicted by economic fundamentals. Our measure thus captures firms? abnormal net hiring, that is, the amount of net hiring not attributable to those underlying economic factors. We note that our approach to measuring investment (in)efficiency is widely used in the capital investment literature (e.g., Richardson, 2006; Biddle et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2013; Garcia Lara et al., 2016; Stoughton et al., 2016). Importantly, our approach also follows recent papers that particularly focus on labor investment inefficiencies (Jung et al., 2014; Ben-Nasr and Alshwer, 2016).  \n\nFor our main analysis, we rely on the labor demand model of Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) to estimate a firm's expected level of net hiring. Their model specification is similar to those used in several recent studies (e.g., Chodorow-Reich, 2014; Falato and Liang, 2016; Giroud and Mueller, 2017; Elul et al., 2018; Benmelech et al., 2019) but has the advantage of using a more comprehensive list of firm-level variables to explain normal hiring practices. Nevertheless, in our robustness tests, we consider several modifications to this model, for instance, by controlling for factors related to the supply of labor and frictions in local labor markets that may affect firms’ investment in employees. We further estimate expected net hiring using a firm's average investment in the previous three years (Titman et al., 2004; Cella, 2014) and median investment in the firm's industry (Harvey et al., 2004; Cella, 2014). Our findings are robust to the use of these alternative proxies and hence do not depend on the use of the Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) labor demand model.  \n\nTo test our predictions, we use a sample of 51,414 firm-year observations from 1982 to 2015. We find strong evidence that the presence of institutional investors with longer investment horizons is associated with significantly lower inefficiencies in labor investments. In particular, the impact of investor portfolio stability on abnormal net hiring is economically significant: a one standard deviation increase in Investor_Stability (0.059), which corresponds to an increase in investment horizon of 6.6 months, is associated with a reduction in abnormal net hiring of $8.9\\%$ relative to the median. This result holds across a variety of model specifications, different measures of expected net hiring, and is robust to controlling for known factors that might affect the efficiency of employment decisions.  \n\nNext, we provide evidence on the interaction between Investor_Stability and different types of inefficiencies in labor investments. Specifically, we investigate over-investment (overhiring and under-firing) and under-investment (under-hiring and over-firing) problems and find that, except for over-firing, each form of inefficiency is mitigated by the presence of long-term investors. Moreover, we show that the impact of Investor_Stability on abnormal net hiring is more pronounced for firms that face higher labor adjustment costs (LACs). It is also stronger for firms with high LACs relative to capital adjustment costs (CACs) or those that attach more importance to their labor force. These findings are consistent with the notion that long-term investors play a stronger monitoring role when deviation from optimal labor demand is more costly to the firm or when human capital is more important to its business model.  \n\nWe run further cross-sectional tests to study the types of firms that are more likely to engage in abnormal net hiring and thus require more monitoring by long-term investors. We contend that the monitoring role of long-term investors is most relevant for firms that have stronger incentives and/or greater opportunities to deviate from expected net hiring. In line with our predictions, we find that the role of long-term investors in reducing labor investment inefficiencies is more important for complex firms and firms with weak governance and/or low financial reporting quality. These firms have greater agency conflicts and information asymmetry, giving management more opportunities to deviate from optimal investment policy and hence requiring more attention from long-term investors. We also find the impact of Investor_Stability on labor investment inefficiency to be more pronounced for companies with shorter-maturity debt, male or older CEOs, and different levels of managerial ownership, which may arguably suffer from greater agency conflicts.  \n\nA major concern with a causal interpretation of our findings is self-selection. The coefficient on Investor_Stability may be biased if long-term investors select firms that are more efficient in their labor investments. Omitted variable bias poses yet another concern. A firm's ownership structure may be related to unobservable factors that also affect its labor investments, leading to a spurious correlation. We address those concerns in four ways. First, we mitigate the omitted variable bias by controlling for a host of corporate governance variables, other non-labor investments, and alternative explanations that may be related to investor horizons. Second, we perform propensity score matching (hereafter, PSM) to alleviate the possibility that our results are driven by observable confounding effects. The PSM analysis shows that, in line with our baseline finding, the abnormal net hiring of firms with high Investor_Stability is significantly lower than that of matched firms with low Investor_Stability.  \n\nThird, following Derrien et al. (2013) and Nguyen et al. (2020), we split long-term investors into non-indexers and indexers. Using Bushee's (1998) institutional investor classifications, we show that our results are similar for both (potentially endogenous) nonindexers and (reasonably exogenous) indexers. The latter are passive investors that are widely diversified and do not trade much; that is, they cannot freely discard firms’ stocks as they must replicate an index. For this reason, they are more likely to influence the firms in which they invest through “voice\". As Derrien et al. (2013) and Appel et al. (2016) describe, indexers cannot be active investors but have an incentive to be activist investors. The fact that our results hold for long-term indexers mitigates the potential concern that long-term investors self-select to invest in firms with more efficient investments in employees.  \n\nFourth, and importantly, we adopt an instrumental variable (hereafter, IV) approach where we exploit the plausibly exogenous variation in the holdings of quasi-indexer investors as a result of the annual reconstitutions of the Russell 1000 and 2000 indexes. Following Schmidt and Fahlenbrach (2017), we track firms that switched from one index to the other in a particular year, focusing on changes in index assignment for firms ranked close to the Russell 1000/2000 threshold. Given that these indexes are value-weighted and quasi-indexer investors have to apply the index weights in their portfolios to mimic their benchmark index and minimize their tracking error, the (random) changes in index assignment for firms around the threshold lead to significant changes in quasi-indexer ownership levels. Using two-stage least squares (hereafter, 2SLS) estimations, we show that exogenous increases in long-term ownership are associated with reductions in labor investment inefficiency, which is consistent with our main finding. Taken together, while it is difficult to rule out endogeneity concerns, our tests consistently point to a causal effect of long-term ownership on labor investment efficiency. Still, we acknowledge that our study only provides indirect evidence on the channel driving this result, namely, monitoring by long-term institutional investors.  \n\nThe main contribution of our study is that we document novel evidence of the role of institutional investors in mitigating incentive problems associated with labor investments. Recent evidence suggests that the presence of long-term investors can help reduce the agency conflicts associated with investments in capital (Cella, 2014), research and development (Bushee, 1998; Aghion et al., 2013; Harford et al., 2018), acquisitions (Gaspar et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2007), and corporate social responsibility (Neubaum and Zahra, 2006; Nguyen et al., 2020). However, existing results regarding the impact of investor horizons on firms? nonlabor investments cannot be generalized to an analysis of labor investments primarily due to differences in their adjustment costs. The classical view of labor typically considers it a variable production factor that has limited adjustment costs, which can be paid out from firm revenues (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). The reason is that, relative to capital expenditures, the timing of labor investments better matches with that of current-year revenues, meaning that labor costs can be covered by operating cash flows (Jung et al., 2014; Khedmati et al., 2019). To the extent that labor is a variable production factor, it has limited market frictions and can be adjusted at a very low cost. Accordingly, one could argue that even when firms deviate from optimal net hiring, they can easily revert to the optimal level. In the absence of labor market frictions, labor adjustment requires little, if any, monitoring effort by long-term institutional investors. Combining this argument with our main hypothesis suggests that the question of whether longterm investors play a role in shaping firms? employment decisions is an empirical one.  \n\nEven in the presence of labor market frictions (e.g., Dube et al., 2010), the cost of adjusting labor appears to be lower than the cost of adjusting non-labor investment (e.g..  \n\nBloom, 2009). Since the magnitude of factor adjustment costs directly determines how firms make investment decisions, the effect of long-term institutional investors on labor investment should differ from that on capital investment. This effect could be more pronounced for labor investment if firms facing relatively higher CACs already maintain capital investment close to its optimal level and thus require relatively less monitoring for capital expenditure. However, when CACs are relatively higher than LACs, long-term investors may have a stronger incentive to monitor capital than labor investment because deviations from the optimal level of capital investment are relatively more costly to the firm. Our arguments are based on the premise that long-term institutional investors may have to carefully consider where to focus their monitoring effort, i.e., on labor or capital investments, since monitoring costs could be significant (Gaspar et al., 2005), and investors have finite monitoring resources. Overall, these arguments lead to alternative views and suggest that the effect of long-term institutional investors on corporate investment in employees is an open empirical question that warrants further research.  \n\nIn sum, it is important to examine whether and to what extent long-term investors reduce inefficient investments in labor. Our study fills this gap in the literature by providing the first evidence that the presence of long-term investors is associated with improvements in corporate decisions relating to investments in labor. Our robustness checks also suggest that this effect is incremental to the impacts of investor horizons on other non-labor investments that may be correlated with investments in employees. As mentioned above, we further find that this effect is more pronounced for firms with higher LACs relative to CACs. This latter finding highlights the differences between labor and non-labor investments in terms of their adjustment costs, thus showing the importance of investigating the former type of investment.  \n\nWe also contribute to a broader line of research that investigates the impact of investor horizons on corporate outcomes, including the cost of capital (Elyasiani et al., 2010; Attig et al., 2013, Huang and Petkevic, 2016), the potential for financial misreporting (Burns et al., 2010), the sensitivity of investment to internal cash flows (Attig et al., 2012), the tradeoff between dividends and share repurchases (Gaspar et al., 2013), seasoned equity offerings (Hao, 2014), and CEO turnover-performance sensitivity (Gao et al., 2017). In robustness checks, we show that our main finding holds after controlling for many of these factors.  \n\nOur study also relates to a growing body of literature on the interactions between labor and corporate policies in the presence of incentive problems and various governance mechanisms. As reviewed above, this literature has examined managers? downsizing decisions (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; Perry and Shivdasani, 2005), their incentives to collude with workers for mutual protection (Pagano and Volpin, 2005; Atanassov and Kim, 2009),their preference for maintaining strong ties with employees, increasing worker wages, and avoiding lay-offs (Cronqvist et al., 2009; Landier et al., 2009), as well as their incentives to under-invest in labor (Graham et al., 2005). We show that the existence of institutional investors with longer investment horizons in a firm's ownership structure can mitigate the incentive problems associated with the firm's employment decisions.  \n\nFinally, our paper is closely related to three recent studies by Jung et al. (2014), BenNasr and Alshwer (2016), and Khedmati et al. (2019) that also consider the implications of agency conflicts for labor investments. However, the focus of those studies is different from ours, as they examine financial reporting quality, stock price informativeness, and absence of CEO-director ties. Our results suggest that investor horizons, as an external governance mechanism, can also help to reduce these inefficiencies.  \n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and research design. Section 3 reports and discusses the main empirical results. Section 4 presents several robustness tests whereas Section 5 addresses endogeneity concerns. Section 6 examines the role of short-term investors, and Section 7 draws conclusions.  \n\n## 2. Data and research design  \n\n### 2.1 Sample and data sources  \n\nWe begin with all firms in Compustat between 1982 and 2015. We then exclude firms with missing data for the main variables used in our regressions. Consistent with the extant literature, we exclude financial firms and utilities (SIC codes between 6,000 and 6,999 or 4,900 and 4,999).6 We obtain data on the portfolio holdings of institutional investors from the Thomson-Reuters Institutional Holdings (13F) database, which provides institutional common stock holdings and transactions, as reported on Form 13F that is filed with the SEC. This data set contains ownership information on common stock positions (of more than 10,0o0 shares or $\\$200,000$ in value) by institutional managers with $\\$100$ million or more in equity securities under discretionary management. Information on firms? net hiring and financial characteristics is obtained from Compustat.? Data on stock returns come from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). To mitigate the effect of outliers, we winsorize all Compustat variables at the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ and $99^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentiles of their distributions. The final sample consists of 51,414 firmyear observations representing 6,313 unique firms over the period 1982 to 2015.  \n\n### 2.2 Investment horizon measures  \n\nTo measure the investment horizon of a firm's institutional investors based on the turnover rate, we proceed as follows. Using data on the portfolio holdings of institutional investors from the Thomson-Reuters Institutional Holdings (13F) database, and following the extant literature (Gaspar et al., 2005; Yan and Zhang, 2009; Cella et al., 2013; Huang and Petkevic, 2016, Hovakimian and Hu, 2016), we compute each institutional shareholder's investment horizon by looking at the quarterly turnover level of their portfolio; that is, the ratio of dollar share purchases and sales during a quarter to the total dollar value of the portfolio. The logic behind this measure is that investors will be classified as long term if they churn their overall portfolio less frequently. Derrien et al. (2013) demonstrate the validity of the portfolio turnover measure as a proxy for the investment horizon by showing that the measure is persistent over time; that is, that the investor horizon is a characteristic of investors, and that the measure is accurate in classifying investors known to be long term, such as Warren Buffett (Berkshire Hathaway), CalPERS, and the Vanguard Group, and those known to be short term, such as Gyorgy Soros (Soros Fund Management) and Stevie Cohen (SAC Capital Management). The turnover rate of institutional investor $i$ in quarter $q$ is calculated as follows:  \n\n$$\nT R_{i,q}=\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{Q_{q}}\\left|N_{k,i,q}P_{k,q}-N_{k,i,q-1}P_{k,q-1}-N_{k,i,q-1}\\Delta P_{k,q}\\right|}{\\sum_{k=1}^{Q_{q}}\\frac{N_{k,i,q}P_{k,q}+N_{k,i,q-1}P_{k,q-1}}{2}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $T R_{i,q}$ is the turnover rate of investor $i$ in quarter $q,Q_{q}$ is the set of companies held by investor $i$ in quarter $q,N_{k,i,q}$ is the number of shares of company $k$ held by investor $i$ in quarter $q$ , and $P_{k,q}$ is the share price of firm $k$ in quarter $q$ . By construction, the range of the turnover rate is the interval [o, 2]. To provide a more stable and accurate classification of an investor's horizon, we then calculate the average turnover level of his/her portfolio over the previous four quarters as follows:  \n\n$$\nA v g\\_T R_{i,q}={\\frac{1}{4}}\\sum_{r=1}^{4}T R_{i,q-r+1}\n$$  \n\nUsing the investor-level turnover rate $(A\\nu g\\_T R_{i,q})$ , we then calculate the firm-level turnover rate as the weighted average of the turnover rates of all institutional investors in a firm's ownership structure:  \n\n$$\nI n v\\_T u r n o v e r_{k,q}=\\sum_{i\\in S_{k,q}}w_{k,i,q}A v g\\_T R_{i,q}\n$$  \n\nwhere $w_{k,i,q}$ is the weight of investor $i$ in the total percentage held by institutional investors in company $k$ at quarter $q$ , and $S_{k,q}$ is the set of institutional investors in company $k$ at quarter $q$ Finally, to ensure that higher values of our horizon proxy correspond to a longer investment horizon and to simplify the interpretation of our results, we multiply the investor turnover measure by -1. We use this proxy, which we call Investor_Stability, to study how the investment horizon of a firm's institutional shareholders affects the efficiency of its labor investments. In addition to this main proxy (Investor_Stability), in Section 5.2 we use alternative measures of long-term investor horizons based on Bushee's (1998, 2001) institutional investor classifications.8  \n\n### 2.3 Measure of labor investment efficiency  \n\nFollowing Pinnuck and Lillis (2007), Ellul et al. (2018), and Benmelech et al. (2019), we use firms’ net hiring, measured as the percentage change in the number of employees between year t-1 and year $t$ , to proxy for investment in employees. We then employ the standard approach in the capital and labor investment literatures (e.g., Richardson, 2006; Biddle et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2013; Jung et al., 2014; Ben-Nasr and Alshwer, 2016; Garcia Lara et al., 2016; Stoughton et al.， 2016), and measure labor  investment inefficiencies (Abnormal_Net_Hiring) as the absolute deviation of actual net hiring from its expected level predicted by economic fundamentals:  \n\nAbnormal_Net_Hiring $=$ [Actual_Net_Hiring - Expected_Net_Hiringl  \n\nOur main approach to estimating a firm's expected level of net hiring is well-grounded in prior research in economics, accounting, and finance. In the labor economics literature, Hamermesh (1989) derives a simple model of long-run equilibrium labor demand, which maximizes firm value.? Subsequent studies then employ a reduced-form labor demand model, often augmented by including a number of firm characteristics. We follow this strand of research and use the labor demand model of Pinnuck and Lillis (2007), which also resembles the employment models estimated in recent studies (e.g., Chodorow-Reich, 2014; Falato and Liang, 2016; Giroud and Mueller, 2017; Ellul et al., 2018). However, while the latter models typically include a limited number of explanatory variables, the Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) model uses an extensive list of firm-specific variables to explain normal hiring practices. Formally, the model takes the following form:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{}}&{{=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}S a l e s\\_G r o w t h_{i,t}+\\beta_{2}S a l e s\\_G r o w t h_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{3}P r o f i t_{i,t}+\\beta_{4}\\Delta P r o f i t_{i,t}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\displaystyle+\\beta_{5}\\Delta P r o f i t_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{6}R e t u r n_{i,t}+\\beta_{7}S i z e_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{8}Q u i c k\\_R a t i o_{i,t-1}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\displaystyle+\\beta_{9}\\Delta Q u i c k\\_R a t i o_{i,t-1}+\\beta_{10}\\Delta Q u i c k\\_R a t i o_{i,t}+\\beta_{11}L e v e r a g e_{i,t-1}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\displaystyle+\\sum_{L=1}^{5}\\delta_{L}L o s s_{-}B i n s_{t}^{1t o5}+\\lambda_{j}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}}}&{{\\mathrm{(5)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the subscripts $i$ and $t$ refer to firm $i$ and year $t$ , respectively. Net_Hiring is the percentage change in the number of employees, Sales_Growth is the percentage change in sales revenue, Profit is net income scaled by beginning-of-year total assets, Profit represents the change in net income scaled by beginning-of-year total assets, Return is the total annual stock return, Size is measured as the natural logarithm of the firm's book value of assets, Quick_Ratio is the ratio of cash and short-term investments plus receivables to current liabilities, Leverage is measured as long-term debt plus debt in current liabilities, scaled by the book value of assets, and Loss_Bins are five dummy variables indicating each interval of profitability of length 0.005 from 0 to -0.025. For example, Loss_Binl takes the value of one if Profit is between -0.005 and O, and zero otherwise, and so on for the other Loss_Bins; see Appendix A for detailed variable definitions. The model also includes industry fixed effects $(\\lambda_{j})$ tocontrol for unobserved industry characteristics affecting net hiring.  \n\nIn Appendix B, we present the regression results for the labor demand model, Eq. (5). We find that sales growth, profitability, stock returns, size, and corporate liquidity have a positive and significant impact on net hiring. Leverage and the loss bins, on the other hand, are negatively associated with net hiring. These results are consistent with Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) and prior theoretical predictions, suggesting that the labor demand model is well estimated. We note that the fitted value from the model is the estimate of a firm's Expected_Net_Hiring, while the absolute value of the unexplained portion (or residual) becomes our estimate of a firm's Abnormal_Net_Hiring. To confirm the validity of our measure of sub-optimal net hiring, we show in our Internet Appendix (Section 1 and Table IA.1) that this measure has a significant and negative impact on future firm market value and operating performance, which is consistent with our conjectures.  \n\n### 2.4 Empirical specification and control variables  \n\nTo explore the interaction between institutional investment horizons and labor investment efficiency, we examine the effect of Investor_Stability on Abnormal_Net_Hiring. Specifically, we estimate the following baseline model:  \n\nAbnormal_Net_Hirin $\\begin{array}{r}{\\imath g_{i,t}=\\alpha+\\delta I n v e s t o r\\_S t a b i l i t y_{i,t-1}+\\beta^{\\prime}X_{i,t-1}+\\lambda_{j}+\\eta_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}}\\end{array}$ (6) where Investor_Stability and Abnormal_Net_Hiring are defined as in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively.The vector $X_{i,t-1}$ includes control variables that, based on previous literature (e.g..  \n\nJensen, 1986; Stulz, 1990; Richardson, 2006; Biddle et al., 2009), are likely to be associated with a firm's investment efficiency. In particular, as in Jung et al. (2014) and Ben-Nasr and Alshwer (2016) we control for investment opportunities, size, corporate liquidity, dividend payouts, cash flow and sales volatilities, tangibility, any incidence of losses, net hiring volatility, labor intensity, and institutional ownership. We also include a proxy for inefficiencies associated with non-labor investments (capital expenditure, R&D expenditure, and acquisitions) to control for any indirect effect on Abnormal_Net_Hiring from other investment decisions. We further account for time-invariant industry heterogeneity and time trends by including a vector of industry fixed effects and time dummies $(\\lambda_{j}$ and $\\eta_{t}$ 0.10 Note that in our robustness tests (Section 4.3), we also control for a number of other variables. Appendix A provides detailed variable definitions.  \n\n### 2.5 Summary statistics and univariate test  \n\nTable 1 reports summary statistics for the labor investment, ownership, and control variables used in our main analysis.l The average and median values of our dependent variable, Abnormal_Net_Hiring, are 0.123 and 0.070, respectively; this means that actual net hiring deviates on average from expected net hiring by 12.3 percentage points. These figures are in line with Jung et al. (2014), who report mean and median Abnormal_Net_Hiring values of 0.113 and 0.070, respectively. Institutional investors own, on average, $43.4\\%$ Offirms equity. There is a clear time trend, with institutional ownership increasing substantially over the last 20 years (untabulated result). The average investor turnover (Inv_Turnover) is 0.191, which means that institutional investors hold an average stock in their portfolio for around 31.4 months.1² Dedicated institutional investors hold, on average, $5.5\\%$ of their portfolio firms? shares, as compared to the $30.3\\%$ held by quasi-indexer investors.  \n\nWe next conduct a univariate analysis in which we compare Abnormal_Net_Hiring for firms with above- and below-median Investor_Stability (untabulated). Our comparison reveals that   firms  with  above-median Investor_ Stability   display significantly  lower Abnormal_Net_Hiring than firms with below-median Investor_Stability. Specifically, the average (median) value of Abnormal_Net_Hiring is $11.4\\%$ $(6.6\\%)$ for firms with above-median Investor_Stability, compared to a value of $13.2\\%$ $(7.4\\%)$ for  firms  with below-median Investor_Stability. The difference of 1.8 (0.8) percentage points is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level, and is economically significant as it amounts to around $15\\%$ $(11\\%)$ of the average (median) value of Abnormal_Net_Hiring. This preliminary finding suggests that more stable ownership by institutional investors is associated with fewer sub-optimal employment decisions, consistent with our main hypothesis.  \n\n## 3. Empirical results  \n\n### 3.1 Investment horizons and labor investment efficiency: Main findings  \n\nTable 2 presents the regression results on the relation between long-term investors and abnormal net hiring. We report $t\\cdot$ -statistics based on heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, clustered at the firm level. Models 1-3 include industry and year dummies. In Model 1, we exclude Investor_Stability and regress Abnormal_Net_Hiring on the control variables. Firms with higher institutional ownership stakes, of a bigger size, with less liquidity, lower debt, positive dividend payouts, more tangible assets, and higher labor intensity tend to exhibit lower inefficiencies in their investments in employees. At the same time, Abnormal_Net_Hiring is positively related to a higher incidence of losses, abnormal non-labor investments,13 and the volatilities of cash flow, sales, and past net hiring. These results are broadly consistent with previous evidence in the literature (e.g., Jung et al., 2014; Ben-Nasr and Alshwer, 2016).  \n\nModel 2 is identical to Model 1 except that Investor_Stability, our main variable of interest, is introduced as an additional explanatory variable. In line with our main hypothesis, we find that the coefficient estimate for Investor_Stability is negative and highly significant, suggesting that a more stable institutional ownership structure helps improve the efficiency of a firm's labor investments.14 The impact of investor portfolio stability on abnormal net hiring is also economically significant: a one standard deviation increase in Investor_Stability (O.059), which corresponds to an increase in the investment horizon of 6.6 months, is associated with a reduction in Abnormal_Net_Hiring of $8.9\\%$ relative to the median.15  \n\nIn the last two models, we evaluate the robustness of our results to controlling for other sources of unobserved heterogeneity. Model 3 repeats the analysis of Model 2 but also adds state-level fixed effects. Including state fixed effects allows us to account for persistent differences across states in characteristics that could affect the investment horizon and labor investment relation; for example, geographic differences, which affect the relocation decisions of highly educated populations (Moretti, 2011), or differences in labor laws such as WDLs that are time-invariant during our sample period and affect the labor demand function (e.g., Serfling, 2016). In Model 4, instead of controlling for industry, year, and state fixed effects separately like we do in Model 3, we include industry-year and state-year fixed effects to control for time-varying heterogeneity across industries and time-varying differences in local economic environments (Gormley and Matsa, 2014). The sign and magnitude of the coefficient on Investor_Stability in Models 3 and 4 is comparable to that of Model 2.  \n\nOverall, our findings are qualitatively similar across a variety of model specifications; that is, institutional ownership stability has a robust and negative impact on abnormal net hiring practices.16 This evidence is consistent with our main hypothesis that the investment horizon of a firm's institutional shareholders increases the efficiency of its labor investments.  \n\n### 3.2  Investment horizons and specific types of labor investment inefficiency  \n\nIn this section, we provide evidence on the interaction between institutional investment horizons and specific forms of labor investment inefficiencies. Specifically, we investigate whether long-term institutional ownership mitigates over- and/or under-investment in labor. There is no a priori reason to anticipate an asymmetric effect on those two forms of investment inefficiencies. Hence, we expect the presence of long-term investors to be associated with lower inefficiencies in both over- and under-investment. We define over-investing firms as those with positive abnormal net hiring (i.e., Actual_Net_Hiring greater than Expected_Net_Hiring) and under-investing firms as those with negative abnormal net hiring (i.e., Actual_Net_Hiring less than Expected_Net_Hiring). We estimate Eq. (6) for these subsamples of over- and under-investing firms and report the results in Table 3.  \n\nPanel A of Table 3 presents the results on the relation between investor stability and over-investment. As in our baseline regressions in Table 2, we include the controls, year, and industry fixed effects. In Models 2, 4, and 6, we further control for state fixed effects. In Models 1-2, we find that Investor_Stability reduces Abnormal_Net_Hiring for over-investing firms. In Models 3-6, we further decompose over-investment into over-hiring and under-firing based on whether a firm's labor force is expected to grow or diminish according to economic fundamentals. Specifically, a firm over-hires (under-fires) if it over-invests when its expected level of net hiring is positive (negative). We find that each form of over-investment is mitigated by the presence of long-term investors.  \n\nIn Panel B of Table 3, we report the results on the effect of investor stability on underinvestment. We use the same model specifications as in Panel A. In Models 1-2, we find that Investor_Stability reduces the deviation between actual and expected net hiring for underinvesting firms. In Models 3-6, we further break down under-investment into under-hiring and over-firing. A firm under-hires (over-fires) if it under-invests when its expected level of net hiring is positive (negative). We find that under-hiring is mitigated by the presence of longterm investors; however, in Models 5-6, the results for over-firing become insignificant. In summary, we find that most specific forms of labor investment inefficiency are mitigated by the presence of long-term investors.  \n\n### 3.3 The role of labor and labor adjustment costs  \n\n#### 3.3.1 Labor adjustment costs  \n\nTo better explain the investor incentives for the observed negative relation between investor horizons and labor investment inefficiencies, we examine whether the impact of Investor_Stability on Abnormal_Net_Hiring varies with the level of LACs. Earlier studies document the presence of economically significant costs associated with firms’ labor adjustments. These costs include the costs of firing (severance pay and lawsuits), searching (recruitment agency fees and advertising), selection and hiring (application screening and interviews), training, and costs due to productivity losses (peer and supervisor disruption).17  \n\nThere are two alternative views regarding the impact of LACs on the relationship between investor horizons and labor investment efficiencies. First, since firms cannot adjust their labor demand in a costless way, they should keep labor turnover stable and minimize deviations from the optimal labor demand policy implied by economic fundamentals (Dixit, 1997). This view implies that long-term investors have a stronger incentive to monitor the employment activities of the firm when it faces higher LACs, because deviations from the optimal labor demand policy are more costly to the firm. Hence, the impact of investor stability on abnormal net hiring should be stronger for firms with high LACs than those with low LACs. An alternative argument is that firms faced with high LACs already have an incentive to reduce abnormal net hiring, in which case they would require less monitoring by long-term investors. This argument predicts that the effect of investor stability on abnormal net hiring is less pronounced for firms with high LACs than those with low LACs. We note, however, that this argument is based on a restrictive assumption that there is no agency conflict between management and shareholders. Under the more realistic assumption that incentive problems exist, the presence of high LACs, by itself, does not necessarily deter self-interested, utilitymaximizing managers from making inefficient labor investments.  \n\nTo proxy for LACs, we use two recently proposed measures in the literature: (a) the state-level passage of WDLs and (b) firms? reliance on skilled labor. First, as in Serfling (2016) we exploit an exogenous variation in firing costs, a major component of LACs, following the state-level recognition of WDLs since the 1970s.18 We use WDL to measure the strength of WDLs in a state; WDL is constructed by summing three distinct dummy variables for each of the three WDLs exceptions. Second, since firms with a high share of skilled workers face higher LACs (Oi, 1962; Pfann and Palm, 1993; Mortensen and Pissarides, 1994; Hamermesh and Pfann, 1996; Dixit, 1997), we adopt labor skills as another measure of LACs. Specifically, we follow Belo et al. (2017) and Ghaly et al. (2017), and use Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Labor's O\\*NET program classification of occupations according to skill level, to construct an industry-specific index, Labor_Skill,that proxies for the LACs faced by the average firm in that industry.19  \n\nTable 4 shows how the impact of firms? Investor_Stability on Abnormal_Net_Hiring varies, conditional on WDL and Labor_Skill. In Panel A, we partition our sample firms into those headquartered in states that have recognized all three WDLs exceptions (i.e., firms with a WDL score of 3 and thus higher LACs) and those headquartered in states that have not adopted any of the exceptions (i.e., firms with a WDL score of O and thus lower LACs). Models 1 and 2 report the results for the whole sample, whereas Models 3-4 and 5-6 show the results for firms with over- and under-investment problems. The results indicate that the impact of Investor_Stability on Abnormal_Net_Hiring is significant only for firms with higher LACs. In particular, for the whole sample, the coefficient on Investor_Stability is approximately four times bigger for firms with high LACs (-0.248) than for firms with low LACs (-0.060); the difference is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. Models 3-4 and 5-6 reveal broadly similar patterns when we examine the impact of Investor_Stability on over- and under-investment problems separately. In Panel B, we define firms in the top (bottom) $30^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentileof Labor_Skill as high- (low-) skill firms, which face high (low) LACs.2° The results continue to show that the impact of Investor_Stability on Abnormal_Net_Hiring is significant only for high-LACs firms; the only exception is the result for under-investment in Models 5 and 6, where the coefficients are insignificant for both subsamples. In sum, our findings are broadly consistent with the view that long-term investors play a stronger monitoring role when the deviation from the optimal labor demand policy is more costly to the firm.  \n\n#### 3.3.2  Labor and capital adjustment costs  \n\nThe previous analysis provides evidence of cross-sectional variation in the relation between long-term investors and labor investment efficiency conditional on firms’ LACs. In this section, we further examine how this relation varies with the cost of adjusting labor investment relative to the cost of adjusting capital investment. A central objective of this analysis is to demonstrate that differences between labor and capital adjustment costs lead to differences in the magnitude of the impact of Investor_Stability on labor investment efficiency, thus showing that the findings of prior studies on non-labor investment do not readily apply to labor investments as well.  \n\nThe economics literature reports that one of the most important differences between labor and non-labor investments lies in their cost of adjustment (Matsa, 2018). While the cost of adjusting labor could be substantial, it frequently appears to be lower than the cost of adjusting non-labor investment. For example, CACs, which include installation costs, losses due to disruptions to production, and particularly the irreversibility of capital investment (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994), are also substantial, and are frequently larger in magnitude than LACs.21 We argue that the magnitude of adjustment costs directly affects how firms adjust their factor demand and reduce investment inefficiency. Since LACs are generally lower than CACs, the impact of long-term institutional investors on labor investment should differ from that on capital investment. The effect of investor horizons could be weaker for capital investment and more pronounced for labor investment if firms faced with relatively higher CACs already have stronger incentives to maintain capital investment close to what is optimal and thus require relatively less monitoring by long-term investors. However, when CACs are relatively higher than LACs, deviations from the optimal level of capital investment are relatively more costly to the firm, giving long-term investors a stronger incentive to monitor capital investment than labor investment; this would imply that the monitoring role of long-term investors is more pronounced for capital than labor investment. Overall, these arguments lead to two opposing predictions for the effect of investor horizons on labor investment efficiency.  \n\nThe evidence presented in Section 3.3.1 indicates that long-horizon investors play a stronger role in monitoring corporate employment decisions in the presence of higher LACs, measured using the (state-level) passage of the WDLs or a labor skill index. This finding is consistent with the argument that in the presence of higher LACs, long-term investors exercise more monitoring to ensure that firms follow their optimal labor demand policy, thus avoiding high costs due to deviations from this policy. Using this line of reasoning, we thus predict that long-term investors have more incentive to monitor firms? labor investment decisions for firms with higher LACs-to-CACs ratios. We note that when the ratio of LACs to CACs is high, adjusting labor becomes relatively more important to firms than adjusting capital.  \n\nTo test our prediction, in Table 5 we exploit the cross-sectional variation in LACs relative to CACs using proxies and estimates of those costs in recent research. In Panel A, we use firms′ reliance on skilled labor to proxy for LACs, as in Section 3.3.1. We then use firms? asset redeployability to measure their CACs; this measure reflects the extent to which assets have alternative uses within and across industries (Kim and Kung, 2017; Campello et al., 2018). In Panel B of Table 5, we proxy for LACs and CACs using the industry estimates from Hall (2004); these estimates are based on the Euler equations for factor demand. We then estimate our model for firms with above- (below-) median LACs-to-CACs ratios.22  \n\nPanel A of Table 5 shows that the impact of long-term investors on labor investment inefficiency, and its two specific forms, over-investment and under-investment, is significant and negative, consistent with our baseline finding. Importantly, the impact of long-term investors is economically more pronounced when the LACs-to-CACs ratio is high; the only exception is the under-investment model where the effect is larger in magnitude for firms with high LACs-to-CACs ratios relative to firms with low LACs-to-CACs ratios but the difference in the coefficients on Investor_Stability is not significant. In Panel B of Table 5, we find that long-term investors have a significant and negative effect on labor investment inefficiency only for firms with high LACs relative to CACs. Tests on subsamples of over- or under-investing firms further confirm that this effect is only significant for firms operating in high LACs-toCACs industries. Overall, the results in Table 5 are consistent with the prediction that the impact of investor horizons on labor investment inefficiency is more pronounced for firms with higher LACs relative to CACs.23 This finding once again underscores the role of factor adjustment costs and the differences between labor and capital, thus justifying the need for our empirical investigation of the effect of institutional investors? horizons on labor investment.  \n\n#### 3.3.3  The importance of human capital  \n\nOur analysis has underscored the importance of institutional investor monitoring for firms facing greater LACs. However, long-term institutions may also have strong incentives to monitor employment decisions when labor is important to the firm's business model, not necessarily when LACs are high. In order to examine this conjecture, we split our cross section based on the importance of human capital to a firm. Recent research suggests that firms relying more on human capital, particularly skilled workers, tend to have substantial R&D investments and intangible assets, including human and organizational capital (e.g., Falato et al. 2018; Klasa et al. 2018). Hence, we proxy for human capital importance using R&D and intangible capital intensity. R&D intensity is measured as the ratio of R&D expenditure to total assets. We consider firms with above- (below-) median R&D intensity as placing more (less) importance on human capital. To capture intangible capital intensity, we follow Peters and Taylor (2017) and define intangible capital as the sum of internally created and externally purchased intangible capital. Each year, we define firms with above- (below-) median intangible capital to total assets as high (low)-intangible capital-intensive and expect them to place greater (less) importance to human capital.  \n\nPanels A and B of Table 6 present the results using R&D intensity and intangible capital intensity as proxies for human capital importance, respectively. Throughout all models in both panels the relation between Investor Stability and Abnormal Net Hiring is greater in magnitude and more statistically significant for firms that place more importance on human capital than those that place less importance on human capital, with the differences in the Investor Stability coefficients between the two subsamples of firms being statistically significant. This finding is consistent with the prediction that long-term institutional investor monitoring is more stringent when human capital is more important to the firm.  \n\n### 3.4  Further cross-sectional analysis  \n\nTo shed more light on the types of firms that are prone to abnormal net hiring and thus require more monitoring by long-term institutional investors, we run additional cross-sectional tests. We argue that the monitoring role of long-term investors is most pertinent for firms that have stronger incentives and/or more opportunities to deviate from expected net hiring through earnings management and/or empire building. Hence, we examine how the relation between long-term institutional ownership and labor investment efficiency varies with firm complexity, corporate governance, financial reporting quality, debt maturity, CEO gender and age as well as managerial ownership. First, while complex firms, such as those operating in multiple business segments, may enjoy certain benefits of diversification (e.g., the internal capital market and co-insurance effect), they face greater agency conflicts and information asymmetries (e.g., Denis et al., 1997; Hoechle et al., 2012). As a result, diversified firms tend to take suboptimal investment decisions, for instance, via earnings management (Lim et al., 2008) and empire building (e.g., Jensen, 1986; Stulz, 1990). To alleviate those incentive problems, long-term institutional investors are likely to pay more attention to complex firms. In a similar vein, firms with weak governance and low financial reporting quality have greater agency problems, operate under greater information asymmetry, and hence provide more opportunities to deviate from optimal investment policy (Jung et al., 2014). Therefore, we also expect these firms to be monitored more closely by long-term investors. Based on these arguments, we expect the impact of Investor_Stability on under-investment and overinvestment in labor to be more pronounced for firms with a higher degree of firm complexity, lower quality of corporate governance, and lower quality of financial reporting.  \n\nOur predictions for the role of the other conditioning variables used in this analysis are more nuanced. Prior research shows that short-term debt acts as an effective external monitoring mechanism that helps discipline firm management (Myers, 1977; Gul and Goodwin, 2010) and alleviate incentive problems, including both underinvestment (Myers, 1977) and overinvestment (e.g., Huang et al., 2018). This view indicates that the impact of long-term investors on both over- and under-investment should be weaker (stronger) for firms with shorter (longer)-maturity debt. On the other hand, since short-term debt is associated with higher liquidity risk and greater lender enforcement, it may encourage borrowers to engage in earnings management (Fung and Goodwin, 2013), particularly to delay the arrival of bad news (Gupta et al., 2008). This view suggests that the impact of investor horizons on labor underinvestment may be more pronounced for firms with more short-term debt.  \n\nRecent research argues that because female directors/executives are more ethical and risk-averse, firms with female directors/executives follow conservative earnings management strategies (Sun et al., 2011) and exhibit high earnings quality (Srinidhi et al., 2011). There is also evidence that, as a result of overconfidence, male executives engage in more acquisitions, including negative NPV deals, than their female counterparts (Huang and Kisgen, 2013). Accordingly, we predict that the impact of long-term institutional investors on both under- and over-investment in labor is more (less) pronounced for firms with male (female) CEOs.  \n\nFurthermore, existing studies document mixed evidence on the role of CEO age in determining managerial incentives to manage earnings and empire build. Due to compensation incentives, young CEOs are likely to be associated with lower financial reporting quality (Huang et al., 2012) and greater bad-news-hoarding behavior (Andreou et al., 2017), while they also tend to pursue more acquisitions (Yim, 2013). However, old CEOs, especially those in the later stages of their careers, may have incentives to cut R&D expenses (Dechow and Sloan, 1991) and engage in more earnings management (Demers and Wang, 2010) to boost short-term performance and post-retirement market value. In addition, due to career concerns, young CEOs may avoid mergers and acquisitions as they are more likely to be fired for poor performance (Chevalier and Ellison, 1999), while, due to retirement preferences, old CEOs, especially those of target firms, are more likely to engage in merger activity (Jenter and Lewellen, 2015). Given the conflicting arguments and evidence, how CEO age affects the link between long-term investors and labor investment inefficiency is an empirical question.  \n\nFinally, managerial ownership is associated with different incentives for managers to deviate from optimal net hiring. The traditional view argues that greater managerial ownership mitigates agency conflicts between managers and shareholders and thus reduces earnings management (Warfield et al., 1995) and accounting conservatism (LaFond and Roychowhury, 2008). Managers with more equity stakes in the firm are also less likely to diversify (Denis et al., 1997) and overinvest (Cook and Luo, 2018) while, consistent with managerial risk aversion, they may be more likely to “play it safe” (Gormley and Matsa, 2016). However, the competing argument suggests that, due to incentives to sell shares in the future, managers with greater stock ownership are more likely to manage earnings (Cheng and Warfield, 2005). These managers are also more likely to become entrenched and thus have an incentive to pursue value-destroying decisions (Narayanan, 1996; Eisdorfer et al., 2013). Again, given the mixed evidence in the literature, the question of how managerial ownership influences the association between investor horizons and labor investment inefficiency is an empirical one.  \n\nTo test the above conjectures, we first run regressions for subsamples of firms with high and low firm complexity. We define a firm with a high (low) degree of complexity as one that has more (less) than two business segments (Ashbaugh-Skaife et al., 2008; Balakrishnan et al.,  \n\n2018; Abernethy et al., 2019). We then examine firms with high and low quality of governance; to measure corporate governance quality, we use the Cain et al. (2017) takeover index. We consider firms with above- (below-) median takeover index scores to be those with high (low) governance quality. Next, we study firms with high and low degrees of financial reporting quality. Using a measure of accounting quality based on discretionary accruals (e.g., Dechow and Dichev, 2002; McNichols, 2002), we define firms with above- (below-) median accounting quality as high (low) reporting quality firms. We then consider the impact of debt maturity by splitting our cross section into firms with below- and above-median short-term debt. We also partition our sample into firms run by male vs. female CEOs and old (above-median age) vs. young (below-median age) CEOs. Finally, we report the results separately for high (abovemedian) and low (below-median) managerial ownership firms. Managerial ownership is defined as the value of the CEO's stock and option portfolio based on Daniel et al. (2019).  \n\nPanels A and B of Table 7 report the results for under-investment and over-investment in labor, respectively. The results in Panel A show that the coefficient on Investor_Stability is only significant and negative in Models 1, 4, 6, 8, 11, and 14 that is, when firms have a higher degree of firm complexity, lower quality of corporate governance, lower quality of financial reporting, more short-term debt, older CEOs, and lower managerial ownership. The $F$ -test results further confirm that the effect of Investor_Stability on labor under-investment is economically stronger for those firms than for firms with the opposite characteristics. The results in Panel B on over-investment are qualitatively similar. The effect of Investor_Stability on over-investment in labor is more pronounced for more complex firms (Models 1 and 2), those with lower financial reporting quality (Models 5 and 6), those with male CEOs (Models 9 and 10), and those with higher managerial ownership (Models 13 and 14). In Models 3 and 4, the impact of long-term investors on labor over-investment is larger for weakly-governed firms than strongly-governed ones, although the difference is not significant. Similarly, in  \n\nModels 7 and 8 (11 and 12) we document a more pronounced impact for firms with more longmaturity debt (older CEOs) but the differences in coefficients are not significant. Overall, the results are broadly consistent with our conjecture that the effect of long-term investors on labor investment inefficiency is stronger among firms that have stronger incentives and/or more opportunities to deviate from expected net hiring.  \n\n## 4. Robustness tests  \n\n### 4.1 Alternative proxies and models for expected and abnormal net hiring  \n\nA central issue in our research design is how we estimate a firm's expected (optimal) level of investment in employees. To examine the robustness of our results, we next replicate our analysis using several alternative measures of expected net hiring. In Panel A of Table 8, we estimate augmented models of expected net hiring. Since the original Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) model includes only industry fixed effects, in Models 1-3, we include additional fixed effects. We control for industry and year fixed effects in Model 1, and then firm and year fixed effects in Model 2. In Model 3, we include firm, industry-year, and state-year fixed effects; the latter fixed effects capture time varying state characteristics (e.g. geographic location and local economic conditions) that could affect the supply of labor to the local labor market. In Model 4, we estimate an augmented Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) model controlling for year, firm, and state fixed effects, as well as eight additional controls that may affect firms? investment in labor and correlate with long-term institutional ownership, namely (a) capital expenditures; (b) R&D expenditures; (c) acquisitions; (d) total institutional ownership; (e) payout ratio; (f) corporate governance quality; (g) WDL, that is, the time-variant state-level recognition of wrongful discharge laws (Serfling, 2016); and (h) future industry sales growth, which captures the forward-looking prospects of the industry where a firm operates. To ensure that Model 4 is as comprehensive as possible, we include both lagged and contemporaneous values of the controls. In Model 5, we interact all the covariates in the original Pinnuck and Lillis (2007)  \n\nmodel with institutional ownership; this specification addresses the concern that the impact of the determinants of labor investment on expected net hiring is conditional on institutional ownership. In Model 6, we apply the methodology proposed by Chen et al. (2018) to deal with potential bias in the two-stage estimation procedure where the first-stage residual is used as the dependent variable in the second-stage regression. Specifically, we include all the covariates from the first-stage estimation of the Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) model in our second stage. The results across all models of Panel A are qualitatively similar to our baseline findings.  \n\nWe next address the possibility that the distribution of Abnormal Net Hiring may differ for firms with different (high vs. low) levels of LACs since these costs may make optimal net hiring respond to economic fundamentals in an asymmetric fashion. To account for this, we first run the Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) labor demand model separately for firms facing low and high LACs to allow for differences in the effects of the independent variables on Net hiring. As before, we proxy for LACs using the firms’ reliance on skilled labor (Labor_Skill), our preferred measure of LACs that captures both the costs of hiring and firing. For each year, we define firms in the top (bottom) 30th percentile of Labor_Skill as high (low) LACs firms. As expected, we document significant systematic differences in the coefficients on some economic fundamentals and the distribution of Abnormal Net Hiring for firms facing low and high LACs. Importantly, we next re-run our main analysis using the estimates for Abnormal Net Hiring calculated separately for low and high LACs firms. The results reported in Panel B of Table 8 suggest that the negative effect of Investor Stability on Abnormal Net Hiring remains significant for the whole sample as well as the over- and under-investment subsamples, although it is more pronounced when Abnormal Net Hiring is estimated separately for firms facing high LACs.  \n\nIn Panel C of Table 8, we consider alternative definitions of optimal net hiring that are not based on any labor demand regression model. In Model 1, we estimate expected net hiring using the median investment in the firm's industry (Harvey et al., 2004; Cella, 2014), defining industries using the Fama-French (1997) 48-industry classification. In Model 2, we estimate expected net hiring using the firm's average investment in the previous three years (Titman et al., 2004; Cella, 2014). In both models, the coefficient on Investor_Stability remains negative and highly significant, suggesting that our results are robust to alternative definitions of expected net hiring that do not depend on the Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) model or its variants.24  \n\n### 4.2 Controlling for other types of investments  \n\nInvestments in labor may be correlated with other forms of investments, such as capital expenditures, R&D expenses, and acquisitions. Thus, a concern with our finding regarding the relation between investor horizons and labor investment inefficiencies is that it could be primarily driven by contemporaneous non-labor investments. Although in our regressions we already include Abn_Non-labor_Invest to control for non-labor investment inefficiencies, we follow prior research (Jung et al., 2014) and perform two tests to mitigate the effects of those investments. First, we examine scenarios in which investments in employees (net hiring) are positively or negatively related to capital expenditures, R&D expenditures, and acquisition expenditures; that is, when an increase in net hiring is associated with an increase or decrease in the other forms of investment. For each type of non-labor investment, we also study subsamples of firms that make investments in labor but report zero or missing values for the type of non-labor investment in question. Second, to further control for capital-labor complementarity, we examine subsamples of industries in which the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is either above or below unity. The results, reported in our Internet  \n\nAppendix (Section 2 and Table IA.2), show that the coefficient on Investor_Stability is significant and negative not only for the subsamples of firms in which labor and non-labor investments move in the same direction and likely act as complements, but also for the other subsamples. This suggests that our main finding is not simply driven by the relation between long-term ownership and non-labor investments.  \n\n### 4.3  Controlling for alternative explanations  \n\nEven though we formally address endogeneity concerns in Section 5, in what follows we carry out a number of tests to control for potential omitted variables or alternative explanations that may drive our results. First, a concern with our analysis is that our findings could be driven by omitted governance variables rather than monitoring by long-term investors. This explanation is based on the view that long-term ownership is associated with good governance practices (e.g., Appel et al., 2016), which are correlated with firms' investment in employees. To address this concern, we follow recent studies (e.g., Bhagat and Bolton, 2013; Cain et al., 2017) and control for a firm's governance by including seven variables in our regressions: (a) the Gompers et al. (2003) corporate governance index (G-index); (b) the Bebchuck et al. (2009) entrenchment index ( $E$ -index); (c) the Cain et al. (2017) takeover index (Takeover index); (d) the natural logarithm of the dollar value of common stock owned by the median director sitting on the board $(D i r e c t\\_O w n)$ ; (e) the percentage of board members classified as independent (Ind_Direct); (f) Duality, which is an indicator variable that takes the value of one if the CEO of the sample firm is also the board chair, and zero otherwise; and (g) Blockholdings, defined as the number of investors that own at least $5\\%$ of a firm's shares,25 which helps alleviate the concern that our findings could be primarily driven by investors' ownership concentration rather than by investor horizons.  \n\nThe results reported in Models 1-7 of Panel A in Table 9 show that the impact of Investor_Stability on Abnormal_Net_Hiring is unaffected when we separately control for different measures of corporate governance.2°6 In Model 8 of Panel A, we find that our result also survives the inclusion of those additional controls all together. In all models the coefficient estimate for Investor_Stability remains negative and highly significant.27 Overall, these results mitigate the concern that our findings may be driven by the correlation between firms' longterm ownership and the quality of their governance practices.  \n\nAnother concern with our analysis is that institutional holdings are associated with several corporate outcomes that may be correlated with Abnormal_Net_Hiring. Since longterm investors can affect firms’ investment in capital (Cella, 2014), R&D (Bushee, 1998; Aghion et al., 2013; Harford et al., 2018), acquisitions (Gaspar et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2007), and stakeholder capital (Neubaum and Zahra, 2006; Rubio and Vazquez, 2016, Nguyen et al., 2020), which are potentially related to labor investments, our inferences could be affected by those non-labor investments. Our results could also be driven by financial reporting quality because high-quality financial reporting, which is associated with long-term ownership (Burns et al., 2010), helps reduce information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders, thus leading to more efficient investments (Biddle and Hilary, 2006; Biddle et al., 2009), including investments in labor (Jung et al., 2014). Meanwhile, our findings may be due to managerial ability as long-term shareholders may invest in companies that happen to have more efficient labor investments simply because they have more able managers. Additionally, since investment in labor is costly, it is affected by firms’ cost of capital, degree of financial constraints, and ability to access capital markets (Benmelech et al., 2015), which are also associated with long-term institutional ownership (e.g., Elyasiani et al., 2010; Attig et al., 2012; Attig et al., 2013, Hao, 2014; Huang and Petkevic, 2016). This argument implies that our results could be driven by those factors.  \n\nTo rule out all these alternative explanations, in Panel B of Table 9, we control for (a) non-labor investments, namely, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures, and acquisitions; (b) financial reporting quality (Dechow and Dichev, 2002; McNichols 2002); (c) managerial ability, proxied by managers’ efficiency, relative to their industry peers, in transforming corporate resources into revenues, including their ability to manage employees more efficiently (Demerjian et al., 2012);28 (d) the implied cost of capital (e.g., Lau et al., 2010); (e) the degree of financial constraints, measured using the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) index;29 (f) corporate social responsibility, measured using KLD data (Nguyen et al., 2020); and (g) equity issues.  \n\nModels 1-7 of Panel B, Table 9, show that controlling for the above additional variables does not affect the statistical and economic significance of the Investor_Stability coefficient. Since those models only include the controls separately, in the remainder of Panel B, Table 9, we consider two comprehensive models that include those variables all together (Model 8), as well as the governance measures used in Panel A (Model 9). We find that the coefficient on Investor_Stability remains significantly negative in both models (albeit at the $10\\%$ in Model 9 due to the small number of observations used). In sum, the results from Table 9 give us some confidence that our results are unlikely to be driven by alternative explanations.  \n\n## 5. Addressing endogeneity concerns  \n\nAlthough we have alleviated the omitted-variable bias by controlling for many timeinvariant and time varying effects, concerns remain over the causal interpretation of our empirical results because of the potential self-selection in long-term investors’ investment decisions and the role of reverse causality inferences. In this section, we present three additional analyses to further alleviate concerns about self-selection and endogeneity in general. First, we perform PSM to further reduce the impact of omitted (observable) variables on our results. Second, we split long-term ownership into indexer and non-indexer ownership, which helps us deal with the self-selection problem. Third, and most importantly, we run IV/2SLS regressions that take advantage of plausibly exogenous changes in ownership by quasi-indexer investors as a result of the annual Russell indexes reconstitutions.  \n\n### 5.1 Propensity score matching  \n\nSince the characteristics of firms with high Investor_Stability may differ from those with low Investor_Stability, we use PSM to control for observable differences in firm and industry attributes among the two groups of firms. We match firms with above-median Investor_Stability with those with below-median Investor_Stability on year, industry (FamaFrench 48-industry classification), and all the control variables from our baseline regression. By matching on industry, we also remove unobserved industry heterogeneity that may be correlated with Investor_Stability. The results, reported in our Internet Appendix (Section 3 and Table IA.3), show that the abnormal net hiring of firms with high investor portfolio stability is significantly lower than that of propensity score matched firms with low investor portfolio stability, consistent with our main finding.  \n\n### 5.2  Indexer versus non-indexer long-term investors  \n\nFollowing Derrien et al. (2013) and Nguyen et al. (2020), we use long-term indexers to mitigate the impact of self-selection. Using indexers is appropriate for our analysis for two main reasons. First, long-term indexers are passive investors that are widely diversified and do not trade much. They cannot choose their portfolio firms based on the firms? labor investment efficiency because they must replicate an index; their incentive is to minimize the tracking error relative to their benchmark index. Therefore, long-term indexers are plausibly exogenous; that is, they are not affected by self-selection. Second, index funds do not have the flexibility to sell their holdings of stocks. As a result of this inability to follow the “Wall Street Rule\", they are more likely to try to influence the firms in which they invest through “voice” or private negotiations (Carleton et al., 1998; Del Guercio and Hawkins, 1999; Becht et al., 2009; Fenn and Robinson, 2009). As Derrien et al. (2013) and Nguyen et al. (2020) argue, indexers cannot be active investors, but they can play an activist role.  \n\nTo examine the effect of long-term indexers on abnormal net hiring, we use Bushee's (1998) classifications of institutional investors: transient, dedicated, and quasi-indexer. We focus on the shareholdings by dedicated and quasi-indexer investors in each firm, who by definition are likely to be long-term investors. The results, reported in our Internet Appendix (Section 4 and Table IA.4), indicate that both types of long-term institutional ownership are negatively associated with abnormal net hiring. Overall, by showing that our results hold for reasonably exogenous long-term indexers, we can largely mitigate the concern that our inferences may be driven by self-selection.  \n\n### 5.3 Russell indexes'reconstitutions  \n\nIn this analysis, we follow recent studies (e.g., Appel et al., 2016, 2019; Crane et al., 2016; Schmidt and Fahlenbrach, 2017) and use the annual reconstitutions of the Russell 1000 and 2000 indexes as a source of exogenous variation to the ownership by long-term indexer investors to identify its impact on labor investment efficiency.30 The Russell 1000 (2000) index includes the 1000 (1001-3000) largest US listed firms by market capitalization. Both indexes are value weighted and exhibit highly significant differences in weights between firms at the top and bottom of each index (Appel et al., 2016). Indexer investors that track these indexes have strong incentives to apply similar weights to their index-mimicking portfolios since they wish to minimize their tracking error. Thus, indexers are expected to hold relatively large (small) equity positions in firms ranked at the top (bottom) of each index.  \n\nFTSE Russell reconstitutes the indexes on an annual cycle (every June) using firms' end-of-May market capitalizations. Following Schmidt and Fahlenbrach (2017), we focus on firms that switch from one index to the other as a result of these reconstitutions, since they are bound to experience significant changes in long-term indexer investment. This is particularly true for firms that are close to the Russell 1000/2000 threshold; that is, they were at the bottom of 1000 but moved to the top of 2000, or vice versa. These switches around the threshold should lead to exogenous changes in long-term indexer ownership since we can safely assume that index assignment around the threshold is random (Appel et al., 2016; Schmidt and Fahlenbrach, 2017). In other words, managers cannot take decisions that affect market capitalization in a way that will accurately predict index assignment so close to the threshold.  \n\nFollowing the arguments presented in Section 5.2, we expect a significant increase in long-term indexer holdings to lead to a reduction in labor investment inefficiency. To test this prediction, we follow recent research (e.g., Schmidt and Fahlenbrach, 2017) and run 2SLS estimations; see our Internet Appendix (Section 5) for additional evidence justifying our estimation approach and a detailed discussion of why it is inappropriate to adopt a regression discontinuity design. As in Schmidt and Fahlenbrach (2017), we use three instrumental variables: the first two are indicator variables equal to one if a stock switches from the Russell 1000 index to the Russell 2000 index $(R I O O O\\textsubscript{\\textit{t-l}}\\rightarrow R2O O O\\textsubscript{\\textit{t}})$ or the Russell 2000 index to the Russell 1000 index $(R2000\\ldots R I\\ldots000\\ldots)$ at the annual Russell index reconstitution. The third instrument tracks the change in index rank from one year to another $(R a n k\\mathbf{\\delta}_{t}-R a n k\\mathbf{\\delta}_{t-I})$ based on end-of-May market capitalization. The first-stage dependent variable is the annual change in quasi-indexer ownership (4Quasi-indexer Ownership) measured at the end of the first quarter following the reconstitution, whereas the annual change in abnormal net hiring (Abnormal_Net_Hiring) becomes the second-stage dependent variable.31 We note that all results are estimated using ranks implied by firms? end-of-May CRSP market capitalization.  \n\nTable 10 reports the results from these 2SLS regressions. We consider two model specifications. In Panel A, we include the same set of controls as in Schmidt and Fahlenbrach (2017). In Panel B, we further add the controls from our baseline specification (Eq. (6)) and the float adjusted market cap (Appel et al., 2016; Crane et al., 2016). In both panels, we focus on switches that are close to the threshold (i.e., those switches resulting from small changes in market capitalization). Specifically, we examine two subsamples of firms that switched by at most 200 and 100 ranks between the two Russell indexes. We do not study all switchers because switches far from the threshold may happen as a result of large changes in market capitalization, which could in turn be related to unobservable changes in firms’ characteristics. This means that the index switch may affect labor investment efficiency not only through its impact on long-term ownership, which could violate the exclusion restriction.  \n\nIn Panel A of Table 10, the first-stage regression results suggest that for both samples of switchers, the coefficients on the instruments are highly significant and with the anticipated sign. In particular, the coefficient on $R I O O O_{t-l}\\rightarrow R2O O O_{t}(R2O O O_{t-l}\\rightarrow R I O O O_{t})$ is positive (negative) and highly significant, consistent with the prediction that Quasi-indexer Ownership increases (decreases) as firms move from the bottom of the Russell 1oo0 index to the top of the Russell 2000 index (the top of the Russell 2000 index to the bottom of the Russell 1000 index). The coefficient on Rank t - Rank $t{-}I$ is negative and significant, which is expected given that as firms move to higher ranks (i.e., when the variable takes negative values), the index weights become larger, and therefore indexer investors increase their holdings. Diagnostic tests (i.e., the $F$ -and $J.$ -tests) both suggest that these instruments are valid. Importantly, the secondstage results show that the coefficient on the fitted Quasi-indexer Ownership is negative and highly significant, consistent with the prediction that increases in long-term ownership lead to reductions in labor investment inefficiency.  \n\nPanel B of Table 10 shows that the results are robust to including the original controls used in our baseline analysis and the float adjustment market cap. Specifically, in the first-stage regressions, the coefficients on the three instruments $R I O O O_{t-l}\\rightarrow R2O O O_{t},R2O O O_{t-l}\\rightarrow R I O O O$ $t,$ and Rank t- Rank $t{-}I$ remain significant with the expected signs. Diagnostic tests are also satisfactory. Moreover, in the second-stage regressions, 4Quasi-indexer Ownership continues to have a negative and significant impact on AAbnormal_Net_Hiring. The magnitude of the effect appears to be larger for firms around the threshold, which are expected to experience the largest change in Quasi-indexer Ownership.  \n\nOverall, our results are robust to controlling for sample selection and endogeneity concerns. Even though we cannot completely rule out these issues affecting our inferences, collectively our findings point to a causal effect of long-term institutional investors on labor investment efficiency. Still, since our tests do not directly capture monitoring by those investors (McCahery et al., 2016), our results should only be regarded as indirect inference about the role of long-term institutional investor monitoring in improving employment decisions.  \n\n## 6. Additional analysis: the role of short-term investors  \n\nWe have focused on the role of long-term institutional investors since we consider them to be the shareholders primarily engaging in monitoring within a firm. Still, we acknowledge that there are alternative views in the extant literature regarding the monitoring incentives of short-term investors. Hence, we now perform additional analysis to test two different views about the impact of short-term ownership on labor investment efficiency. The first view predicts that short-term investors do not play an effective monitoring role and thus should not reduce abnormal net hiring. This is because short-term investors may have weak incentives to monitor managers, as they have little time to learn about the firm during the short period in which they hold its shares, and hence face significant monitoring costs (e.g., Gaspar et al., 2005). Due to the lack of effective monitoring, firms with short-term ownership tend to do worse in takeovers (Gaspar et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2007). Additionally, short-term investors may lead to managerial myopia (e.g., Stein, 1989; Froot et al., 1992; Von Thadden, 1995) and short-term incentives (Bolton et al., 2006). Managers concerned with short-term results may therefore engage in earnings management (e.g., Bushee, 1998) while under-investing to temporarily boost the short-term stock price (Bolton et al., 2006), especially if their actions are not likely to be detected and/or do not lead to wealth extraction from shareholders. Empirically, Cremers et al. (2019) provide causal evidence that the presence of short-horizon investors has a positive impact on short-term earnings but a negative one on long-term investment.  \n\nHowever, the alternative view argues that short-term investors may improve firm governance and hence reduce labor investment inefficiency. This view is based on two arguments. First, activist hedge funds, typically classified as short-term, may propose strategic, operational, and financial improvements in firms, leading to increases in their long-term shareholder value (Brav et al., 2008; Brav et al., 2015; Boyson et al., 2017). Second, even when short-term investors are not activists, they may still play a monitoring role by incorporating relevant information about firms into their stock prices quickly through their trading (Edmans, 2009). However, for short-term investors to be effective monitors, they need to rely on the support of other types of investors, including investors with long horizons (Harford et al., 2018; Appel et al., 2019). Since short-term hedge funds tend to hold a small fraction of the firm's ownership, the success of their campaign may depend on the role of those investors with a vested interest in the firm, that is, investors with long horizons. Likewise, Harford et al. (2018) argue that even when short-term investors help provide value relevant information through stock price signals, it is the action by long-term investors that influences managers and ensures that these stock price signals are translated into appropriate corporate policies. Overall, these arguments suggest that, together with other investors, those investors with short investment horizons can help monitor firms and reduce labor investment inefficiency.  \n\nTo test those conflicting views, we regress Abnormal_Net_Hiring on short-term ownership while controlling for the role of long-term investors. The results in Model 1 of Table 11 show that long-term investors have a significant and negative effect on labor investment inefficiency, consistent with our baseline finding. However, after controlling for long-horizon investors, the impact of short-term ownership is significant and positive, consistent with the first view that rather than playing a monitoring role, short-term investors might have incentives to exacerbate labor investment inefficiency. In the next two models of Table 11, we study the type of labor inefficiency short-term investors are associated with. In Model 2, there is no evidence that short-term ownership is associated with over-investment. Model 3, however, shows that short-term ownership is positively correlated with under-investment in labor, although the effect is only significant at the $10\\%$ level. In Models 4 and 5, we attempt to better understand when short-term investors are associated with under-investment. Specifically, we rerun our regression for subsamples of firms with different probabilities of earnings manipulation, measured using the M-score (Beneish, 1999). The results show that short-term investors are associated with firms that engage in under-investment and earnings management only when the likelihood of earnings manipulation being detected is low. Again, this finding is consistent with the first view about the role of short-term investors. In sum, our results provide evidence consistent with a “dark side” of short-term institutional ownership.  \n\n# 7. Conclusion  \n\nThis paper examines the relationship between the investment horizon of institutional shareholders and the efficiency of their portfolio firms’ labor investments. We argue that monitoring, or the threat of monitoring, by long-term investors deters managers from deviating from the optimal level of investment in employees. Consistent with this argument, we find that abnormal net hiring, measured as the absolute deviation from net hiring predicted by economic fundamentals, decreases in the presence of long-term investors. Our evidence suggests that the presence of long-term investors mitigates both over-investment and under-investment in labor.  \n\nWe also show that the monitoring role of long-term investors is more pronounced for firms facing higher labor adjustment costs or higher costs of adjusting labor relative to capital, as well as those placing greater importance on their labor force. This finding supports the argument that long-term investors play a stronger monitoring role when deviation from the optimal labor demand policy would be more costly to the firm, or when human capital is more important to its business success. In further cross-sectional analysis, we find that the effect of long-term ownership on labor investment inefficiency is more pronounced for firms that are more complex, have weaker corporate governance, lower financial reporting quality, shortermaturity debt, male or older CEOs as well as different levels of managerial ownership, consistent with the idea that monitoring by long-term investors is more important for firms that have stronger incentives and/or greater opportunities to deviate from optimal net hiring.  \n\nTo mitigate sample selection and endogeneity concerns, we perform several additional tests. Specifically, we estimate model specifications that control for alternative explanations. We also show that our main results hold for both potentially endogenous long-term nonindexers and plausibly exogenous long-term indexers, which helps mitigate sample selection concerns. In addition, we run analyses using PSM. Importantly, we conduct IV regressions aimed at examining the impact of exogenous changes to long-term ownership on changes in labor investment inefficiency as a result of the annual reconstitution of the Russell 1ooo and 2000 indexes. The results from these analyses support our main findings and all point to a causal effect of long-term investment on labor investment efficiency.  \n\nHowever, caution should be taken in interpreting our results. Although our analyses consistently show that institutional investors play an important role in shaping firm-level employment decisions, they only provide indirect inference about the mechanism driving the result, namely, monitoring by long-term institutional investors. This is indeed a common drawback facing this line of research (Harford et al., 2018), since most of the monitoring by institutional owners involves private communication and “behind the scenes\"” intervention (McCahery et al., 2016), and hence is quite challenging to directly measure. Future research that can better capture the monitoring role of institutional investors is much warranted.  \n\nReferences   \nAbernethy, M. A., Kuang, Y. F., Qin, B., 2019.

The relation between investor horizons and abnormal net hiring  \n\nThis table reports the regression results on the impact of institutional investment horizons on abnormal net hiring. In Model 1, we regress Abnormal_Net_Hiring on the set of control variables, and industry and year fixed effects. In Model 2, we include Investor_Stability as an additional explanatory variable.

Investor horizon and specific types of labor investment inefficiency  \n\nThis table reports the regression results on the impact of institutional investment horizon on specific types of labor investment inefficiency. In Panel A, we examine the relation between investor horizon and over-investment in labor. Panel B reports the results on the relation between investor horizon and under-investment in labor. In Models 1 and 2 of Panel A, we estimate Eq. (6) for a subsample of over-investing firms where over-investment is defined as positive abnormal net hiring. In Models 3-6 of Panel A, we further decompose over-investment into over-hiring and under-firing. A firm over-hires (under-fires) if it over-invests when its expected level of net hiring is positive (negative). In Models 1 and 2 of Panel B, we estimate Eq. (6) for a subsample of under-investing firms, where under-investment is defined as negative abnormal net hiring. In Models 3-6 of Panel B, we further decompose under-investment into under-hiring and over-firing. A firm under-hires (over-fires) if it under-invests when its expected level of net hiring is positive (negative). All regressions include year and industry fixed effects, and all the covariates from our baseline specification. In Models 2, 4, and 6, we also control for state fixed effects.

The role of labor adjustment costs  \n\nThis table presents the impact of institutional investment horizon on abnormal net hiring for firms facing high labor adjustment costs (LACs) versus firms facing low LACs. In Panel A, we proxy for LACs using the strength of wrongful discharge laws $(W D L)$ in the state where a firm is headquartered. For each year, we define firms with a WDL score of 3 (i.e., firms in states that recognize all three exceptions) as high LACs firms and those with a WDL score of 0 (i.e., firms in states that recognize none of the exceptions) as low LACs firms. In Panel B, we proxy for LACs using firms? reliance on skilled labor (Labor_Skill). For each year, we define firms in the top (bottom) $30^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of Labor_Skill as high (low) LACs firms. The last row reports the p-values of the $F\\cdot$ -tests for differences in the coefficients on Investor_Stability for the two subsamples of high and low LACs firms.

The importance of human capital  \n\nThis table shows how the impact of institutional investment horizon on abnormal net hiring is affected by the importance that the firm attaches to its employees. In Panel A, we proxy for the importance of human capital to a firm using R&D intensity measured as the ratio of R&D expenditure to total assets. Each year, we define firms with above (below)-median R&D expenditure to total assets as high (low)-R&D-intensive. In Panel B, we proxy for the importance of human capital using intangible capital intensity. We follow Peters and Taylor (2017) and define Intangible capital as the sum of internally created and externally purchased intangible capital. We measure the stock of internally created intangible capital as the sum of Knowledge capital, which we estimate by accumulating past R&D spending using the perpetual inventory method, and Organizational capital, which we estimate by accumulating a fraction $(30\\%)$ of past selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses using the same method. Externally purchased intangible capital is the balance sheet item Intangible Assets (intan). We scale Intangible capital by the book value of total assets (at). Each year, we define firms with above (below)- median Intangible capital to total assets as high (low)-intangible capital-intensive.

Investor horizon and labor investment inefficiency: Cross-sectional variation  \n\nPanel A (B) examines the relation between investor horizon and under- (over-) investment in labor for subsamples of firms with different characteristics. Over-investing firms are defined as those with positive abnormal net hiring. Under-investing firms are defined as those with negative abnormal net hiring. In Models 1 and 2, we examine firms with a high degree of complexity versus firms with a low degree of complexity. Firm complexity is a dummy variable set equal to one if a firm has more than two business segments, and zero otherwise. In Models 3 and 4, we present the results for firms with varying degrees of corporate governance quality. We proxy for corporate governance quality using Cain et al.'s (2017) takeover index. Firms with above-median (below-median) takeover index are defined as high (low) governance quality firms. In Models 5 and 6, we present the results forfirmwithvarying dgreeoffinanciarporingqualityFm with aboveedianbelw-medianacountingqualityaedefined as highow)reporingquality firms. Accounting Quality is defined in Appendix A. In Models 7 and 8, we present the results for firms with below-median (above-median) short-term debt. Short-term debt is the ratio of debt due in the next three years to total debt ( $(\\mathrm{dlc}+\\mathrm{dd}2+\\mathrm{dd}3)/(\\mathrm{dltt}+\\mathrm{dlc}))$ . In Models 9 and 10, we present the results for firms with male versus female CEOs. In Models 11 and 12, we present the results for firms with old (above-median age) versus young (below-median age) CEOs. In Models 13 and 14, we report the results for high (above-median and low (below-median)managerial owership, defined as thevalue of theCEO's stock and option porfolio (based onDaniel et al, 2019). The last rowreports the p-values of the $F$ -tests for differences in the coefficients on Investor_Stability for the two subsamples being compared.

Expected net hiring: Robustness tests and alternative proxies  \n\nThis table presents the results of robustness tests in which we replicate our main analysis using several alternative estimations of the Pinnuck and Lillis (2007) (P&L) model (Panels A and B), and alternative measures of expected net hiring (Panel C). In all models, we regress Abnormal_Net_Hiring on Investor_Stability and the control variables. In Model 1 of Panel A, we estimate expected net hiring using the P&L model with industry and year fixed effects. In Model 2, we estimate expected net hiring using the P&L model after adding time effects and replacing the industry dummies with firm fixed effects. In Model 3, we estimate expected net hiring using the P&L model controlling for firm, industry-year, and state-year fixed effects. In Model 4, we estimate expected net hiring using the P&L model controlling for year, firm, and state fixed effects as well as eight additional controls. In particular, we control for (a) capital expenditures measured as the ratio of capital expenditures (capx) to total assets (at); (b) R&D expenditures measured as the ratio of R&D expenses (xrd) to net sales (sale), and is set equal to zero when R&D expenses (xrd) are missing; (c) Acquisitions measured as the ratio of acquisitions (aqc) to total assets (at); (d) Institutional ownership; (e) Payout ratio defined as the ratio of common dividends (dvc) to total assets (at); (f) corporate governance quality measured by Cain et al.'s (2017) takeover index; (g) WDL, which captures the time-variant state-level recognition of wrongful discharge laws (Serfling, 2016); and (h) future industry sales growth, which captures the forward-looking prospects of the industry where a firm operates. All the covariates in Model 4 are included in both lagged and contemporaneous forms. In Model 5, we interact all the covariates in the original P&L model with institutional ownership. In Model 6, we apply the methodology proposed by Chen et al. (2018) to deal with potential bias in the two-stage estimation. Specifically, we include all the covariates from the first-stage estimation of the P&L model in our second stage. In Panel B, we estimate expected net hiring using the P&L model separately for firms facing high labor adjustment costs (LACs) versus firms facing low LACs. We proxy for LACs using firms? reliance on skilled labor (Labor_Skill). For each year, we define firms in the top (bottom) $30^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of Labor_Skill as high (low) LACs firms. In Panel C, we use alternative measures of expected net hiring that do not rely on the P&L model. In Model 1, we estimate expected net hiring using the median investment in the firm's industry. Industries are defined using the Fama-French (1997) 48-industry classification. In Model 2, we measure expected net hiring using the firm's average investment in the previous three years. All regressions for the second stage include year and industry fixed effects. All the other variables are defined in Appendix A.

Controlling for alternative explanations  \n\nThis table reports the regression results on the impact of institutional investment horizons on abnormal net hiring, controlling for various firm-level corporate governance variables (Panel A) and variables that have been shown by previous papers to be related to investor horizon (Panel B). G-index is the Gompers et al. (2003) corporate governance index of 24 antitakeover provisions. $E\\cdot$ -index is the Bebchuck et al. (2009) managerial entrenchment index. Takeover Index is the Cain et al. (2017) takeover index. Direct_Own is the natural log of the dollar value of common stock owned by the median director. Ind_Director is the percentage of board members classified as independent. CEO Duality is an indicator variable that takes the value of one if the CEO of the sample firm is also the board chair, and zero otherwise. Blockholdings is the number of institutions whose ownership is at least $5\\%$ of the firm's outstanding shares. For non-labor investments, we control for capital expenditures, R&D expenditures, and acquisitions. Cost of capital is the implied cost of capital estimated following Lau et al. (2010). Financial constraints is proxied using the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) (KZ) index. CSR is corporate social responsibility, which is measured using KLD data following Nguyen et al. (2020). Equity issues is the ratio of equity issues (sstk) to total assets. In Panel A, Models 1-7 control separately for each governance variable. Model 8 controls for all the governance variables. In Panel B, Models 1-7 control separately for each variable. Model 8 controls for all the variables in Panels A and B with a comparable number of non-missing observations to the main sample; these include the takeover index, blockholdings, non-labor investments, financial reporting quality, managerial ability, equity issues, and financial constraints. Model 9 controls for all the variables in Panels A and B. All the other variables are defined in Appendix A.

Identification strategy: The reconstitution of Russell indexes  \n\nThis table reports the results from instrumental variable (IV) regressions using two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimations. The dependent variable in the first stage is the change in quasi-indexer ownership (Quasi-indexer Ownership), which is calculated as the annual change in the fraction of shares held by quasi-indexer institutional investors in a firm, measured at the end of the first quarter after the reconstitution. The first two instruments for Quasi-indexer Ownership are indicator variables equal to one if a stock switches from the Russell 1oo0 index to the Russell 2000 index $(R I O O O\\textsubscript{\\textit{t-l}}\\rightarrow R2O O O\\textsubscript{\\textit{t}})$ or the Russell 2000 index to the Russell 1000 index $(R2000\\mathbf{\\Omega}_{t-l}\\rightarrow$ $R l O O O_{t})$ at the annual Russell index reconstitution. The third instrument tracks the change in index rank from one year to another $(R a n k\\mathbf{\\nu}_{t}-R a n k\\mathbf{\\nu}_{t-I})$ . The regressions in the second stage include the fitted values of Quasi-indexer Ownership as well as all the control variables included in the first-stage regressions. The dependent variable in the second stage is the annual change in abnormal net hiring (4Abnormal_Net_Hiring). The IV regressions focus only on switchers around the threshold. The first regression includes firms that, in a given year, switched by at most 2o0 ranks between the two Russell indexes, whereas the second regression focuses only on firms that switched by at most 1o0 ranks. All regressions include year and industry fixed effects. In Panel A, we report the results using the same set of controls as in Schmidt and Fahlenbrach (2017). In Panel B, we also include the controls from our baseline specification (Eq. (6)) and the float adjusted market cap. End-of-May Market Cap is CRSP price (prc) multiplied by number of shares outstanding (shrout). Float Adjustment is the difference between the rank implied by the observed end-of-May CRSP market capitalization and the rank assigned by Russell in June (Crane et al., 2016). All the other variables are defined in Appendix A. $F\\cdot$ -statistic is the statistic from the Ftest of the joint significance of the instruments in the first-stage regressions. $J.$ statistic $\\mathrm{\\check{p}}$ -value) is the $\\mathsf{p}$ value from the Hansen (J) test of instrument overidentification. The $t$ -statistics in parentheses are based on robust standard errors clustered at the firm level. \\*\\*\\*, $^{**}$ , and \\* denote statistical significance at the $1\\%$ ， $5\\%$ , and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nPanel A.

The impact of short-term investors  \n\nThis table reports the results for the separate effects of short- and long-term ownership on abnormal net hiring. We present the results for the whole sample in Model 1. In Models 2 and 3, we present the results for the subsamples of over- and under-investing firms, respectively. In all models, we regress Abnormal_Net_Hiring on short-term ownership, long-term ownership, and the control variables. Short-term ownership is measured as the percentage of shares owned by transient institutional investors based on Bushee (1998). Long-term ownership is measured as the percentage of shares owned by dedicated and quasi-indexed institutional investors based on Bushee (1998). In Models 4 and 5, we examine the relation between short- and long-term ownership and underinvestment in labor for subsamples of firms with different probabilities of earnings manipulation.

    "reference_markdown": "# Venture Capital Distributions: Short-Run and Long-Run Reactions  \n\nPAUL GOMPERS and JOSH LERNER\\*  \n\n## ABSTRACT  \n\nVenture capital distributions, a legal form of insider trading, provides an ideal arena for examining the share price impact of transactions by informed parties. These sales, which occur after substantial run-ups in share value, generate a substantial price reaction immediately around the event. In the months after distribution, returns apparently continue to be negative. When the short- and long-run reactions are decomposed, they are consistent with the view that venture capitalists use inside information to time stock distributions: Distributions of firms brought public by lower quality underwriters and of less seasoned firms have more negativepricereactions.  \n\nAN ENDURING ISSUE IN THE CORPORATE finance literature has been the impact of trading by informed insiders on securities prices. Two cases initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the early $1960\\mathrm{s}^{1}$ Stimulated an interest in this relationship and its implications for social welfare (e.g., Manne (1966)) that continues to this day.  \n\nAn extensive body of research has examined the trading by corporate insiders. Most notably, Seyhun (e.g., 1986, 1988) has documented the shortand long-run price impacts of trading by officers, directors, and other insiders. But as Meulbroek (1992) notes:  \n\nSelf-reported corporate transactions data [are] less appropriate for addressing [the impact of informed traders on stock prices]. The corporate transactions are by definition not based on material, non-public information. Because corporate insiders cannot legally trade on such information, they would most likely refrain from reporting their violative transactions to the SEC. (pp. 1662-1663)  \n\nThis paper also attempts to address this problem by examining the stock price reaction to a set of transactions by informed parties that are not affected by these legal constraints. But rather than focusing on illegal trades, as Meulbroek does, we examine a class of legal transactions that are largely exempt from SEC oversight—the distribution of shares in public companies by venture capital funds to their limited partners. Venture capitalists raise money from investors and make equity investments in young, high-risk, highgrowth companies. Most successful venture-capital-backed companies eventually go public in an underwritten initial public offering (IPO). Venture capitalists can liquidate their position in the company by selling shares on the open market and then paying those proceeds to investors in cash. More frequently, however, venture capitalists make distributions of shares to investors in the venture capital fund.  \n\nThese distributions have several features that make them an interesting testing ground for an examination of the impact of transactions by informed insiders on securities prices. Because they are not considered to be “sales,\" the distributions are exempt from the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the securities laws. The legality of distributions provides an important advantage. Comprehensive records of these transactions are compiled by the institutional investors and intermediaries who invest in venture funds, addressing concerns about sample selection bias. Like trades by corporate insiders, transactions are not revealed at the time of the transaction. Venture capitalists can immediately declare a distribution, send investors their shares, and need not register with the SEC or file a report under Rule 16(a). The occurrence of such distributions can only be discovered from corporate filings with a lag, and even then the distribution date cannot be precisely identified. To identify the time of these transactions, one needs to rely (as we do) on the records of the partners in the fund. We can also characterize in detail the features of the venture funds making the distributions, the firms whose shares are being distributed, and the changes associated with the transactions in a way that can discriminate between the various alternative explanations for these patterns.  \n\nFrom the records of four institutions, we construct a representative set of more than 700 transactions by 135 funds over a decade-long period. The results are consistent with venture capitalists possessing inside information and with the (partial) adjustment of the market to that information. After significant increases in stock prices prior to distribution, abnormal returns around the distribution are a negative and significant $-2.0$ percent,comparable to the market reaction to publicly announced secondary stock sales. The sign and significance of the cumulative excess returns for the twelve months following the distribution are sensitive to the benchmark used. The market's ability to discern and react to the information content of distributions is consistent with Seyhun (1986) and Meulbroek (1992).  \n\nSignificant differences appear in the returns for some subsamples. Distributions that occur in settings where information asymmetries may be greatest—especially where the firm has been taken public by a lower-tier underwriter and the distribution is soon after the IPO—have larger immediate price declines. Postdistribution price performance is related to factors that predict event window returns.  \n\nAt the same time, we must acknowledge some important limitations to the analysis. Many of the recipients of these distributions (e.g., pension funds and endowments) will not desire to hold the distributed securities. Because distributions are not illegal, the limited partners have no reason to disguise their sales (aside from reasons of strategic trading). In this sense, the distributions resemble the legal insider transactions that have been extensively examined by Seyhun (1986) and others. Furthermore, at least two other factors may cause the share price to drop at the time of distribution: the ending of the venture capitalists' value-added monitoring (they often resign from the board at the time of the distributions) and the large increase in the public supply of shares after distribution (if demand for the company's stock is not perfectly elastic). To test these alternatives, we seek to explain the size of the short- and long-run reactions to these distributions. Variables that are consistent with these alternative hypotheses have little explanatory power.  \n\nIn addition to works on insider trading, this study is related to several strands in the corporate finance literature. First, we draw on the methodological studies of the measurement of long-run returns of securities. Recent works include Ball, Kothari, and Shanken (1995), Barber and Lyon (1997), Kothari and Warner (1997), and Barber, Lyon, and Tsai (1998). Second, an extensive literature (e.g., Mikkelson and Partch (1985) shows that announcements of firms' intentions to undertake secondary issues and sales of shares by corporate insiders lead to immediate negative market reactions. More recently, Kahle (1996) shows that firms issuing securities after insider sales experience significant negative excess returns, but other securities issuers do not. Another related strand is studies of the long-run performance of IPOs (e.g., Loughran and Ritter (1995)). The paper closest to this one is that of Brav and Gompers (1997), which contrasts the post-IPO stock returns of venture-backed and non-venture-backed firms. Though there certainly is overlap between the two analyses (most of the firms we examine had gone public relatively recently, on average one -and one-half years prior to the distribution), our focus here is different. Rather than studying the long-run returns of a particular class of securities, we are seeking to understand how rapidly transactions by informed insiders are incorporated into the stock price. At the same time, our finding of greater efficiency in the market for venturebacked securities (when contrasted with Kahle's results) is reminiscent of their conclusions.  \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section I provides an overview of venture capital distributions. The data are described in Section II. Section IHI analyzes stock price performance around distributions. Section IV concludes the paper.  \n\n## 1. Venture Capitalists and Distribution Policy  \n\nMore than 80 percent of all institutional venture capital in the United States is organized as limited partnerships (Gompers and Lerner (1996)). The venture capitalist serves as general partner and the investors are limited partners. Venture capital funds have contractually determined lifetimes of about one decade, but the typical venture organization raises a new fund every few years. Venture capitalists are active investors in the companies they finance (typically, small privately held entities). They sit on the boards of directors, provide advice, hire key managers, etc. They may possess information that is not publicly available—e.g., the firm only met its profitability projections by booking a key sale in advance. In return for their services, the venture capitalist receives contractually agreed-upon compensation. This compensation usually entails a fixed fee based on capital or assets under management and a percentage of the profits (often 20 percent).  \n\nVenture capitalists typically exit successful investments by taking them public (Gompers and Lerner (1998)). They usually do not sell shares at the time of the IPO, but rather undertake a “lock-up\" agreement with the investment banker underwriting the offering in which they promise to refrain from selling their shares for several months.2 Even after the lock-up expires, venture capitalists often continue to hold shares in the company for months or even years. Once they decide to liquidate their positions, they have two alternatives: They can sell the shares they hold on the open market and distribute cash to limited partners, or, as is more often the case, they can distribute shares to each limited partner and (frequently) themselves.  \n\nThere are a number of reasons for the preponderance of distributions in kind. First, SEC rules restrict sales by corporate insiders. Insiders, including the venture capitalist, are only allowed to sell shares each quarter up to the greater of 1 percent of the outstanding equity or the average weekly trading volume. The venture capital fund may hold a large fraction of the company's equity and selling the entire stake may take a long time. By distributing shares to limited partners, who are usually not considered insiders,3 the venture capitalist can dispose of a large block of shares more quickly.  \n\nSecond, tax motivations may also provide an incentive for the venture capitalist to distribute shares. If venture capitalists sell shares and distribute cash, taxable limited partners (e.g., individuals and corporations) and the venture capitalists themselves are subject to immediate capital gains taxes. These investors might prefer to postpone the taxes by receiving distributions in kind and selling the shares at a later date. (These considerations will be unimportant to tax-exempt limited partners such as pension funds and endowments.) By distributing stock, venture capitalists provide limited partners with the flexibility to make their own decisions about sellingthestock.  \n\nThird, if selling the shares has a large negative effect on prices, venture capitalists may want to distribute shares. The method of computing returns employed by limited partners and outside fund trackers (e.g., Venture Economics) uses the closing price of the distributed stock on the day the distribution is declared. The actual price received when the limited partners sell their shares may be lower. If prices decline after the distribution, actual returns to limited partners could be substantially less than calculated returns. Venture capitalists care about stated returns on their funds because they use this information when they raise new funds.  \n\nFinally, the venture capitalist's compensation can be affected by distribution policy. If the venture capital fund has not returned committed capital to its limited partners, most funds distribute shares of portfolio companies in proportion to the partners’ actual capital commitments (usually 99 percent to limited partners and 1 percent to general partners). By distributing overvalued shares prior to the return of committed capital, the venture capitalist moves closer to the point where general partners collect a larger share of the profits. Once committed capital has been returned, venture capitalists still have an incentive to distribute overvalued shares. They may be able to sell their portions at a high valuation before limited partners receive their shares and the market discerns that a distribution has occurred. This problem is exacerbated if the venture partnership agreement allows, as many do, the venture capitalist to receive distributions at his own discretion prior to the return of the investors’ committed capital. In these instances, the venture capitalist has even greater flexibility in choosing whether to include himself in the distribution.  \n\nA venture capitalist's reputational concerns may not overcome the incentive to distribute overvalued shares. First, many institutional investors and advisors also care about stated return. They may be compensated based on how well the venture funds they select do relative to a benchmark (calculated using the distribution price). This is particularly true if the shares are transferred immediately on receipt of the distribution to the investor public equity managers. Any price decline may be attributed to the public equity group. Second, certain investors may be unaware of the problem. Investors may not track stock price performance against an appropriate benchmark. Similarly, record keeping of the price at which the shares were sold is often incomplete.  \n\nFew SEC regulations cover distributions by private equity investors. Rule 16(a) states that individuals who are affiliates of a firm, such as directors, officers, and holders of 10 percent of the company's shares, must disclose any transactions in the firm's stock on a monthly basis. Provision 16(a)-7, however, explicitly exempts distributions of securities that (i) were originally obtained from issuers and (ii) are being distributed “in good faith,in the ordinary course of business.\" An interpretation widely accepted within the industry is that venture capitalists distribute investments in the normal course of business, and that they do not convey any information unless the venture capitalist makes an explicit recommendation to hold or sell the shares at the time. Venture capital lawyers have applied the same principles when considering the applicability of Rule 10(b)-5, the most general prohibition against fraudulent activity in the purchase or sale of any security.  \n\n### 11. The Data  \n\nWe collect data on the date, size, and sources of all distributions received by two institutional investors in venture funds and two investment advisers. We eliminate distributions from funds that primarily invest in leveraged buyouts and from publicly traded small business investment companies because the nature of these funds'investments and the incentives introduced by their compensation schemes and structures are quite different. In the relatively modest number of cases where contradictory information is recorded about the same distribution, we check with the organizations to reconcile the discrepancies. These deletions and corrections leave 731 distributions of shares in 259 firms by 135 venture capital limited partnerships.  \n\nThe first panel of Table I summarizes the IPOs and distributions in our sample. The increasing trend in distributions reflects two factors. First, the IPO market has hot and cold periods. The early 1990s saw a prolonged “hot issue” market with many IPOs. Second, venture capital under management grew substantially during this period: the venture pool being twelve times larger (in inflation-adjusted dollars) in 1993 than in 1980. The panel also shows how the aggregate number of venture-backed IPOs and distributions by venture capitalists increases over this period.  \n\nIn Panel B of Table I, we examine the representativeness of the venture funds for which we are able to collect distribution data. We compare the venture partnerships in our sample with all the partnerships identified by Venture Economics that closed prior to 1993 (for an overview of the database and our emendations to it, see Gompers and Lerner (1998)) on several dimensions: the age of the venture organization sponsoring the fund (the span between the date when the venture organization's first fund closed and the first closing of this fund), the size of the venture organization (the sum of funds in 1993 dollars that the venture organization has raised in the decade prior to the distribution), and the ordinal rank of the fund (the count of this fund among those raised by the venture organization). Though our sample is representative in terms of closing date, it is biased toward larger, older venture capital firms that have raised more previous funds.  \n\nMore information about the distributions is presented in Panel C. The typical distribution occurs nearly twenty months after the firm goes public. This distribution is skewed, with the median distribution occurring a little more than one year after the IPO. Only one percent of the distributions occur in the three months immediately after going public because the lock-up agreements that restrict insiders from selling shares after an IPO (typically for 40 to 180 trading days) preclude stock distributions as well.4  \n\nIn many cases, there are multiple distributions for each firm because of the presence of several venture investors in the firm rather than multiple distributions of shares in the company by the same venture capitalist. Venture capitalists tend to distribute the entirety of their holdings at once; Panel C of Table I reports that the average distribution involves 67 percent of shares that the venture capitalist holds. The table also provides summary data on two representative distributions: the first and fifth distributions of shares in a company. Not surprisingly, fifth distributions tend to occur later and involve a smaller percentage of the venture capitalist's original holdings. (If there are many distributions, it is more likely that the venture capitalists are distributing their shares in several installments.) We discuss the issues posed by multiple distributions below.  \n\nWe have already noted an important distinction between venture distributions and illegal insider trading: The limited partners may have few incentives to disguise the fact that a distribution has occurred. Additional  \n\n# Table I Sample Summary Statistics  \n\nIn Panel A, the venture capital stake of initial public offerings (IPOs) is the value of all shares held by venture capital (VC) limited partnerships in firms that went public in that year valued at the IPO price. The distribution series is the value of shares distributed by all venture capital limited partnerships to their investors, and is based on the records of Shott Capital Management (including distributions not in our sample). Panel A also presents the number of IPOs and distributions in each year of the sample. In Panel B, the first two columns compare the characteristics of the funds in our sample with those within the Venture Economics funds database whose first closing was in December 1992 or earlier but are not in our sample. We present both the mean and the median (in parentheses) of several measures. The third column presents the $p$ valuesof $t$ -tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (in parentheses) of the null hypotheses that these distributions are identical. Panel C presents some key characteristics of the distributions, as well as of some important independent variables.  \n\nPanel A: Summary of IPO and Distribution Activity   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">All Activity (billions of 1993 dollars)</td><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td>Venture Stake in IPOs</td><td>Venture Distributions</td><td>No. of IPOs in Sample</td><td>No. of Distributions in Sample</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1978 1979</td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0 0</td></tr><tr><td>1980</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.09</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1981</td><td>0.39</td><td>0.12</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1982</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.30</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1983</td><td>2.19</td><td>0.53</td><td>18</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1984</td><td>0.37</td><td>0.27</td><td>11</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1985</td><td>0.36</td><td>0.33</td><td>8</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>1986</td><td>1.43</td><td>0.35</td><td>27</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>1987</td><td>1.29</td><td>0.62</td><td>22</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>1988</td><td>0.74</td><td>0.26</td><td>16</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>1989</td><td>0.63</td><td>0.40</td><td>15</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>1990</td><td>1.17</td><td>0.69</td><td>20</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>1991</td><td>3.15</td><td>1.48</td><td>55</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>1992</td><td>3.19</td><td>1.42</td><td>44</td><td>195</td></tr><tr><td>1993</td><td>3.52</td><td>1.70</td><td>14</td><td>142</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>18.69</td><td>8.55</td><td>259</td><td>731</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Panel B: Comparison of Funds Included and Not Included in the Sample</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>Included in Sample</td><td>Not in Sample, but in Venture Economics Database</td><td>p-Value, Test of No Difference</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Number of observations Date offund's first closing</td><td>135 Mar.1984 (Jan.1984)</td><td>1139 Oct.1983 (Apr.1984)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Size of Fund (millions of</td><td>99.2 (69.3)</td><td>42.9 (28.9)</td><td>0.143 (0.908) 0.000 (0.000)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">1993 dollars) Size of venture firm (millions</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">of 1993 dollars)</td><td>206.4 (118.0)</td><td>109.1 (50.8)</td><td>0.000 (0.000)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Age of venture firm at time of fund's first closing</td><td>5.63 (4.17)</td><td>3.65 (1.17)</td><td>0.000 (0.000)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">(years) Ordinal rank of fund</td><td>3.20 (3)</td><td>2.65 (2)</td><td>0.000 (0.000)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable I—Continued   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel C:Characteristics ofDistributions</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>Median</td><td>Std.

First, venture capitalists hold large equity stakes and board seats even after the IPO. When the venture capitalist declares a distribution, an active, large-block shareholder is essentially dissolved. Theoretical and empirical work by Jensen and Meckling (1976), Shleifer and Vishny (1986), and others have shown that large-block shareholders, who are often willing to incur the costs of monitoring management, can play an important role in increasing firm value. The unanticipated dissolution of a large-block holding provides an alternative explanation for stock price declines at the time of the distribution.  \n\nA second explanation is driven by the increased number of publicly tradable shares associated with distributions. Though the findings are not uncontroversial, a number of studies (e.g., Harris and Gurel (1986) and Shleifer (1986)) have suggested that demand curves for shares may slope downward. If the demand for shares is not totally elastic, then increasing the supply of publicly tradable shares would decrease their price. The median lead venture capitalist controls 11.8 percent of the shares of the company subsequent to the IPO (Barry et al. (1990)). Because a typical venture-backed IPO has only about 30 percent of the shares in the initial public float, the distribution and subsequent sale of the venture capitalists’ securities represent a substantial increase in the number of publicly traded shares and may trigger a price decline.  \n\nLiquidity may play a role in price movements even if long-run demand curves for shares are not downward-sloping. Bid-ask spreads or temporary price movements may be related to abnormal volume in the market. For example, a large block of shares may trade at a lower price because the market for the company's equity is not very liquid. If liquidity is the primary reason for price movements, stock prices should decline around distributions but quickly recover thereafter.  \n\nOne way to address these alternative explanations is to examine how stock price reactions to distributions are associated with the characteristics of the venture capitalist and the firm. Though many of these individual items can be criticized for their imprecision, if the evidence is consistent with a considerable majority of one set of predictions, we will be more comfortable with that view. We first examine the impact of the age of the venture organization making the distribution. If the markets are reacting to insider trading by the venture capitalists, distributions by more experienced venture capitalists should produce more negative price reactions. The corporate control alternative also predicts a negative relationship, because older venture firms may be better monitors and the elimination of their oversight reduces firm value more. We determine venture firm age from the Venture Economics database.5  \n\nThe size of the equity stake held by the venture firm may be related to the incentive to monitor and the quality of information about the company. Both our central insider trading hypothesis and the corporate control alternative predict a negative relationship between the size of the equity stake and the price reaction to the distribution. The downward-sloping demand curve suggestion predicts that only the size of the equity stake actually distributed should affect prices. The stock price reaction should be independent from the total equity stake held (but not distributed) by the venture capital firm. (If the market can forecast future distributions at the time of the first distribution, stock price reaction to the first distribution may be related to the size of the equity stake held.) This information is obtained from the parties receiving the distributions.  \n\nUnderwriters may also play a role in limiting asymmetric information. The number and quality of analysts are often correlated with the reputation of the underwriter. If the market is reacting to insider trading by the venture capitalists, then companies going public with higher quality underwriters should have less-negative price reactions because there are fewer information asymmetries. The characteristics of the IPOs of the distributed companies are found in Securities Data Corporation's Corporate New Issues database. We denote the quality of the underwriters using their relative standing in the period from 1985 to 1991 (Carter, Dark, and Singh (1998)).  \n\nThe level of asymmetric information between the venture capitalists and the market may be considerably higher for companies that have been public for a short time because such firms are likely to have less analyst coverage as well as a shorter track record over which their management and prospects can be assessed. If venture capitalists have access to inside information suggesting that these firms are severely overvalued, they may quickly distribute recent IPOs. On average, the market should interpret distributions soon after the IPO as a sign of relatively greater overvaluation, and the length of time from the IPO to distribution should be positively related to abnormal returns. The corporate control and downward-sloping demand alternatives suggest that the price response should be independent from the length of time that the shares have been held. If the market is reacting to insider trading or if the corporate control alternative holds, then most of the negative information will be conveyed in the first distribution of a company's shares. Later distributions should have much smaller price responses because the first distribution reveals that the venture capitalist considers the firm overvalued or that he intends to exit the investment.  \n\nAvailability of information may also be related tothe size of the firm. Larger firms are likely to be tracked by more and better analysts and are more likely to be scrutinized in the media, thereby reducing the level of asymmetric information. The ability to trade on inside information should therefore be lower for larger firms and price declines at distribution should be smaller. The alternative views have no clear predictions about the relationship between the price reaction and firm size. We employ the valuation at the close of the first trading day for this analysis.  \n\nBoard representation may also be associated with greater access to inside information. Consequently, if the market is reacting to insider trades, there should be more negative price reactions to distributions by board members. The corporate control alternative would also predict that a company's stock price declines more when venture capitalists leave the board at distribution. Not only is a large block dissipated, but the venture capitalists no longer have the same control rights or information flows once they leave the board. Board membership and share ownership at and after the IPO date are obtained from prospectuses and annual proxy statements.  \n\nContracts governing venture partnerships can also specify whether venture capitalists must distribute or sell shares soon after the IPO. If distributions within a certain time are mandatory, the market should not infer any negative information from the distribution event. If the alternative corporate control view or the downward-sloping demand curves view explains price reactions, then distribution restrictions should not affect the magnitude of the price decline at distribution. Unfortunately for our empirical tests, the bulk of the distribution restrictions (which we collect from partnership agreements provided by the four institutions who contribute distribution data) are quite weak: The partnership agreements of funds with restrictions almost invariably allow distributions to be deferred with the approval of the majority (or supermajority) of the fund's advisory board. In practice, it appears that these distribution restrictions have a relatively limited effect on behavior: For the 20 venture-backed IPOs in the sample where distributions were made by funds both with and without distribution restrictions, the distribution dates were not significantly different from each other. In fact, the average distribution by a fund without such a restriction occurred two weeks before that by a fund with a restriction. (This result was not driven by a single outlier among the restricted distributions. There was actually a lower variance in the time from IPO to distribution among the restricted distributions, though the difference was not significant.） Thus, the extent to which this measure can help us distinguish between hypothesesseemslimited.  \n\n## II. Stock Price Reaction to Distributions  \n\n### A.Euent Window Returns  \n\nThe stock price response to distributions is estimated using a two-factor market model employing daily CRSP stock price data. The two-factor market model utilizes $R_{m,t}$ , the return on the CRSP Value-Weighted Nasdaq Index, and $R_{s,t}$ , the return on the Nasdaq smallest decile, to determine daily abnormal returns. Equation (1) is estimated for each firm using daily data.  \n\n$$\nR_{j,t}=\\alpha_{j}+\\beta_{j,m}R_{m,t}+\\beta_{j,s}R_{s,t}+\\epsilon_{t}.\n$$  \n\nThe regression coefficients (factor loadings) are calculated from trading day $-260$ to day $^{-61}$ and from trading day $+160$ to day $+360$ relative to the distribution (or for the available subsets of these periods). We designate as day O the day that the venture capitalist declared the distribution.6 The coefficients are then used to calculate predicted returns. The difference between the predicted and actual return is labeled an abnormal return (AR), as shown in Equation (2):  \n\n$$\nA R_{j,t}=R_{j,t}-(\\alpha_{j}+\\beta_{j,m}R_{m,t}+\\beta_{j,s}R_{s,t}).\n$$  \n\nTable II documents the large price appreciation before the distribution. The cumulated ARs (CARs) for the twenty days prior to distribution is $+3.7$ percent. The abnormal returns for the three trading days following the distribution are all negative and significant. From day O to day $+3$ ， the CAR is $-2.0$ percent. The next seventeen trading days show little price movement. Figure 1 plots the CARs for all distributions. After a major rise of $+7.4$ percent from day $-60$ today $^{-1}$ , the three days after the distribution date have negative CARs. Over the next three weeks the stock price reacts very little. From day $+20$ to $+100$ , the CAR is once again significantly negative, $-5.5$ percent. This overall pattern is only suggestive of long-run returns. Cumulating daily returns over long time horizons may introduce biases. Section IHl.B explores long-run returns using buy-andhold excess returns.  \n\nTableII Abnormal Returns, Cumulative Abnormal Returns, and Trading Volume around Distributions The sample is 731 distributions by 135 venture capital funds between January 1983 and December 1993. The abnormal returns (ARs) a1 derived from a market model using both the CRSP Value-Weighted Nasdaq Index and the Nasdaq smallest decile as factors. Cumulativ abnormal returns (CARs) are calculated by summing the ARs for the period specified. $t$ statistics calculated from the cross section of abnorm returns or cumulative abnormal returns are in parentheses.

Cumulative average abnormal returns for the entire sample of distributions. The abnormal returns are derived from a market model using both the CRSP ValueWeighted Nasdaq Index and the Nasdaq smallest decile as factors. Cumulative abnormal returns are calculated by summing the abnormal returns. The sample is 731 distributions by 135 venture capital funds between January 1983 and December 1993.  \n\nTable III, Panel A, summarizes the short-run reactions to distributions. CARs are calculated from day O to day $+3$ (the event window). This is somewhat different from many event studies that examine the CARs from the day before the event to the day after. Unlike many phenomena examined in event studies (e.g., takeover bids), it was unlikely that there would be any \"leakage\" of news prior to the event: The decision to distribute is usually made solely by the venture group without consultation with outside advisors or financial intermediaries. Thus, we feel it inappropriate to include the day prior to the distribution. (Indeed, as Table II indicates, the abnormal volume in the day before the offering was little different from the other days prior to the distribution.) Because distributions are not publicly announced, we think that the market would incorporate the information into the stock price more slowly. Many distributions also occur after the market closes. It might take several days for investors to receive their certificates. We consequently employ a four-day window. The table also presents $p$ -valuesfrom $t$ -testscomparing differences in the mean CARs for the various subsets of firms. The only significant differences are between the underwriter ranking: Issues brought public by more reputable underwriters experienced greater declines. As discussed above, the presence of a high-quality underwriter suggests reduced asymmetric information.7  \n\nPanel B of Table II presents regression analyses of these patterns. The dependent variable is the CAR from day O to day $+3$ .All regressions are weighted least squares, where the weight is the inverse of the variance of stock returns for the firm in the estimation period. Though the regressions are very noisy and the goodness-of-fit low, the significant coefficients are consistent with the insider trading hypothesis.8 First, companies going public with higher quality underwriters have less-negative price declines at distribution. Second, as predicted by the hypothesis that the market is reacting to insider trading, distributions that occur soon after the IPO lead to more negativeprice reactions.  \n\nThese variables are not only statistically significant but are also economically meaningful. Consider the leftmost regression in the second panel. At the mean of the independent variables, the predicted net-of-market return in the distribution window is $-1.8$ percent. A one-standard deviation reduction in the Carter-Manaster ranking of the book underwriter (i.e., by 1.1 rank) leads to a predicted event window return of $-2.8$ percent.A onestandard deviation increase in the time from IPO to distribution (that is, by  \n\n8 A natural question relates to the correlation of the independent variables. All correlation coefficients are less than 0.35. We explore the impact of deleting one of these pairs of variables with correlation coefficients that are statistically significant—for example, either the logarithm of firm market value or the market value of the stake held by the venture capitalist. These deletions have little impact on the results in this set of regressions or those reported below. Results are little changed when we use substitutes for several of independent variables such as ordinal rank of the venture fund for fund age, the market value of the company holdings by the venture capitalist for the percentage stake, and a dummy variable indicating whether the venture capitalist left the board for the board seat dummy.  \n\n# TableIII Returns around and after Distributions  \n\nThe sample is 731 distributions by 135 venture capital funds between January 1983 and December 1993. The distribution window abnormal returns (ARs) are derived from a market model using both the CRSP Value-Weighted Nasdaq Index and the Nasdaq smallest decile as factors. Cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are calculated by summing the ARs for the period from the day of distribution to three days after the distribution. The postdistribution excess returns (ERs) are for months $^{+1}$ to $+12$ relative to the distribution month. The ERs are the difference between the firms' returns and the buy-and-hold return on the CRSP Value-Weighted Nasdaq Index times the mean beta for the entire sample (in Panel A), and the buy-and-hold return from a portfolio matched by size and book-to-market ratio and the matching Fama-French industry portfolio (in Panel B). In Panel A, we report the sample means for observations where the variable is above the median or where the answer to the posed question is “yes\"; the sample means for observations where the variable is below the median or where the answer to the posed question is $^{\\mathrm{{6}}}\\mathrm{{no}}^{\\mathrm{{,}}\\mathrm{{7}}}$ ; and the $p$ values from $t$ -tests of the difference in means. Panel B presents four regressions: the distribution window regressions are weighted least squares where the weight is the inverse of the variance of stock returns for the firm in the estimation period, and the postdistribution ones are ordinary least squares. Net-of-market returns before the distribution are the CARs from day $-20$ to day 0 in the second regression; and ERs from month $^{-6}$ to month $^{-1}$ in the fourth regression.

Neither the corporate control nor the liquidity alternative receives much support from the regression results.  \n\n### B. Long-Run Excess Returns  \n\nFigure 1 provides some evidence of long-run price appreciation before distribution and price declines after distribution, but the pattern is only suggestive. The magnitude of the price movements may be biased by cumulating abnormal returns over long horizons. In order to compute long-run returns, we use monthly returns from CRSP. Figure 2 plots the nominal buy-andhold returns for the firms from twelve calendar months prior to twelve calendar months after distribution. For comparison, the return on the CRSP Value-Weighted Nasdaq Index is plotted as well. The graph shows that returns increase sharply starting four months prior to the distribution. From the month after the distribution to month $+8$ , nominal returns are quite modest. These are computed using calendar months. For a distribution occurring in January, we designate the firm's February stock return as that of month $^{+1}$ , whether the transfer occurred on January 2 or January 31. The predistribution run-up is not biased upward by first-day returns of IPOs. Venture-backed firms, like other IPOs, are typically underpriced, and gain on average 8.4 percent on their first day (Barry et al. (1990)). To avoid this bias, we exclude from this and subsequent analyses any firms completing an IPO in a given month; firms are included in the sample only in their second and later calendar months of trading.  \n\nWe employ three approaches to calculating excess returns. First, we estimate a standard market-adjusted return. The appropriate measure of expected returns for these companies must be calculated outside the sample period. Because many of the companies went public less than one year prior to distribution, some distributions have little out-of-sample data. To overcome this problem, we estimate the beta from monthly data for all firms that have fifteen trading months of returns outside of the window from six months before to twelve months after the distribution. (We use all available monthly observations on the CRSP tapes through December 1995.) The mean beta is 1.596, the median is 1.511, and the interquartile range is 1.26 to 1.94. Excess returns (ERs) are calculated by subtracting 1.596 times the buy-and-hold return of the CRSP Value-Weighted Nasdaq Index from the buy-and-hold return of the company,? as shown in equation (3).  \n\n$$\nE R_{i,(a,b)}=\\prod_{t=a}^{b}(1+R_{i,t})-1.596*\\prod_{t=a}^{b}(1+R_{N A S D A Q,t}).\n$$  \n\nA second approach is to calculate returns net of benchmark portfolios composed of firms matched by size and book-to-market equity values. Comparing performance to size and book-to-market portfolios seems reasonable given the work of Fama and French (1992), which shows that size and book-tomarket are important determinants of stock returns. We form the size and book-to-market portfolios as described in Brav, Géczy, and Gompers (1996). We use all NYSE stocks to create quintiles of firms based on market capitalization, with an equal number of NYSE firms in each quintile. We obtain our accounting measures from the COMPUSTAT quarterly and annual files and define book value as book common equity plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credits for the fiscal quarter ending two quarters before the sorting date, the same definition as in Fama and French (1992). Within each size quintile we form five book-to-market portfolios (with an equal number of NYSE firms in each book-to-market quintile) for a total of 25 $(5\\times5)$ size and book-to-market portfolios.1o Value-weighted returns are calculated for each portfolio for the next three months. We repeat the above procedure for April, July, and October of each year. In order to avoid comparing distributed firms to themselves, we eliminate firms undertaking initial or follow-on public offerings from the various portfolios for five years after their equity issue. Each issue is matched to its corresponding benchmark portfolio. Each quarter the matching is repeated, thus controlling for the time-varying firm risk characteristics of each distribution.  \n\nFinally, we calculate returns net of an industry benchmark. We match the firms to the forty-nine value-weighted industry portfolios developed by Fama and French (1997). For each distribution we compute the difference between the firm's returns and the return on the relevant industry benchmark. The sample sizes are somewhat smaller as certain firms cannot be matched to an industry portfolio due to the incompleteness of the Fama-French industry classification scheme.  \n\nIf prices fully react to the informational content of the distribution, longrun excess returns should be zero on average in the months after the distribution. If the market underreacts or it takes time to learn that the venture capitalist has distributed his shares, then long-run drifts in prices may occur. Table III explores the long-run excess returns for the twelve months after the distribution. The results are sensitive to the benchmark used. Using market-adjusted returns, the distributed shares lose 5.4 percent of their value in the next year. The use of portfolios matched by book-to-market and size or industry groupings as a benchmark, however, leads to positive excess returns.l Long-run excess returns are positively correlated with underwriter rank, just as in analysis of abnormal returns in the event window. Sorting firms based on valuation at the close of the first trading day reveals that smaller firms have lower returns than their larger counterparts.  \n\nMultivariate examinations of the long-run returns are presented in the second panel. The dependent variable is the excess return from month $^{+1}$ to month $+12$ . Independent variables are the same as the ones used in the short-run analysis. Once again, the regression results are noisy. Factors that predict the short-run reaction to distributions also seem to have at least some power to explain the long-run price response. In the left regression (and several unreported ones), underwriter ranking is positively related to performance in the months after the offering. The magnitude of the effect declines when firm size (also positively associated with returns) is used as an independent variable. Overall, the market appears to quickly incorporate into the stock price the information contained in the distribution.  \n\nA major concern relates to the independence of observations. Though the magnitude of the distribution run-up and run-down is similar throughout the sample period, correlations across the observations may lead to an understating of the standard errors. This problem has two dimensions. First, the data set includes distributions of shares of the same firm by different venture capital funds. Additionally, venture capitalists may distribute shares of different firms in particular industries, such as computers and biotechnology, at approximately the same time. Because the returns of these young firms may be quite correlated, the observations may not be truly independent.  \n\nWe address concerns about the nonindependence of the observations in two ways. First, we calculate all the long-run returns using only the first distribution for each firm. Results are qualitatively similar, although significance levels fall in the regressions reflecting the smaller sample sizes. We also address the correlation across different firms. Bernard (1987) discusses this problem and demonstrates that the primary source of bias in such settings is intraindustry cross-correlations as opposed to correlations across industries. One way to address this problem is to compute returns for firms net of the appropriate industry benchmark rather than a general market index. As discussed above, the results using this approach are broadly consistent with the other analysis. These concerns are also addressed by Barber et al. (1998), who find that forming excess returns using size and book-tomarket matched portfolios eliminates many of the biases in long horizon returns, including the skewness of the test statistics as well as much of the cross-sectional correlation induced by the clustering of observations in calendar time. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that there may still be significant cross-sectional correlations in the residuals, leading to understated standard errors and overstated $t$ -statistics.  \n\nIn a supplemental analysis, we examine trading volume, which an extensive literature (e.g., Easley and O'Hara (1987)) suggests is a key mechanism through which the market discovers trades by informed insiders. Table II shows that the distribution window is associated with considerably larger trading volumes than other times.12 We examine abnormal volume by estimating an ordinary least squares regression. Following earlier work, we use the logarithm of firm trading volume as the dependent variable and control for such variables as day of the week, news events, and Nasdaq market volume. Abnormal volume is significantly higher during the distribution window. In supplemental analyses, we show that the higher volume is associated with greater price movements, but the effect is not significantly stronger in the distribution window.  \n\n## IV. Conclusion  \n\nThis paper examines the distribution of venture capital investments to the investors in venture capital funds by the funds' general partners. This is a unique environment where transactions by informed insiders are exempt from antifraud provisions. The legality of these transactions allows us to build a systematic database. The evidence is consistent with the market reacting to the inside information of the venture capitalist; the 2 percent drop around the distribution is akin to the reaction to public announcements of secondary stock sales even though venture capital distributions are not publicly disclosed.  \n\nWhen we disaggregate the market reactions, the patterns appear to be consistent with the view that this is a reaction to insider trading rather than the two other explanations we offer. In particular, distributions for firms backed by higher quality underwriters also appear to lower asymmetric information and reduce the negative cumulative abnormal returns at distribution. Distributions of less seasoned firms, which may be associated with greater asymmetric information, also trigger larger immediate price declines. The long-run postdistribution returns are more ambiguous. Though the extent and significance of the market reaction appears to vary with the benchmark employed, at least some evidence suggests that the market does not fully incorporate information at the time of distribution.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nBall, Ray, S.
