By severely limiting the possibility of the rural population to work beyond their place of birth, the reintroduction of serfdom in 1733 aimed to increase monopsony power and secure cheaper labour in the countryside. Using a unique data source based on the archives of estates from the eighteenth century, we test whether serfdom affected the wages of farmhands more strongly than other groups in the labour market, and results based on a difference-in-differences approach reveal evidence consistent with a strong negative effect following its introduction. This is confirmed when we use a different control group from the Swedish province of Scania. We also investigate whether one mechanism was that boys with rural backgrounds were prevented from taking up apprenticeships in towns and find suggestive evidence that this was indeed the case.  \n\nHow do policies or institutions designed to reduce the mobility of workers affect monopsony power and thereby wages? This is a question of considerable importance both for the world today, as well as in the past, with authors such as Genicot (2002) and Acemoglu and Wolitzky (2011) noting that labour transactions throughout most of history, and a significant fraction of such transactions in developing countries today, are coercive and often attempt to limit mobility.1 Moreover, monopsony power in product and labour markets has been argued to be on the rise even in advanced economies (Council of Economic Advisors, 2016). Search and mobility costs create imperfections in the labour markets, where employees cannot exploit potential arbitrage opportunities offered by homogeneous job vacancies (Boeri and van Ours, 2021). In the twentyfirst century these costs might even have increased, since new waves of globalisation and of advanced technological change have facilitated the product market concentration of the most productive firms (Autor et al., 2017a; 2017b) and thus their monopsonistic power. In addition, collusion among employers and the intensive use of legal instruments such as no-poaching agreements limits the fexibility of labour markets (Krueger and Ashenfelter, 2018). While models of imperfect competition have been used to analyse a wide variety of labour market phenomena following seminal work by Robinson (1933), Burdett and Mortensen (1998) and Manning (2003), credible estimates of the effect of monopsony power on wages are in general lacking (Naidu et al., 2016). The present paper on the other hand provides new evidence on this effect by considering a large negative shock to labour mobility in the form of the reintroduction of serfdom in eighteenth-century Denmark, for which we have unique individual-level labour marketdata.  \n\nAlthough historical studies are largely in line with the view that the restrictions on labour mobility associated with serfdom were negative for economic development (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2005, p. 441),2 an unequivocal long-run relationship between labour market imperfections and wage dynamics has not so far been identified. Thus, Dennison (2006, p. 74) highlighted that ^a revisionist view has emerged, which portrays serfdom as having had little or no effect on peasants’ social and economic behaviour'. Ogilvie (2005, p. 93) similarly pointed out that revisionists have adduced $\\c[\\c]\\cdots\\emph{J}$ evidence that serfs sometimes migratedwithout apparent manorial hindrance′, and a similar debate has played out in the Danish historiography.3 This interpretation thus suggests that farmhands found ways of getting around the mobility restrictions associated with serfdom, and that its effects could very well be negligible.4 Resolving this debate requires, however, individual micro-level labour market data of the type we exploit here.  \n\nThus, in this paper, we provide new quantitative evidence on the effects of reducing mobility in the labour market by exploiting the introduction of ^the Danish equivalent of serfdom' (Ostergaard, 1995) known as adscription (in Danish stavnsband) in Denmark in 1733. Although in principle adscription was applied to the entire rural population, we leverage that it was mostly targeted at tying male farmhands to the estate in the area in which they were born (Olsen, 1933; Skrubbeltrang, 1961). These agricultural workers were largely unskilled, and since they became bound to a given estate, the monopsony power of the estate would increase in relation to this group, with the consequence that the wages of agricultural workers were likely to decrease compared to other groups in the labour market as, e.g., the mobility of craftsmen would be much less affected by serfdom. Moreover, adscription could also serve to prevent young men from the countryside from moving out of the rural sector via an apprenticeship in a town.  \n\nOur dataset contains information on the wages, occupation and geographical location, as well as other characteristics of individuals selling their labour to an estate. This allows us to divide the data into different groups and evaluate whether there was a differential impact on farmhands, as compared to other groups in the labour market in a difference-in-differences approach. This means that we exploit the reintroduction of serfdom as our source of variation across time combined with the fact that serfdom was targeted at farmhands, which provides us with variation across occupations. We therefore control for time and occupation in all our estimations. Given the micro-level nature of the data, we can also control for fixed effects for gender, geographical factors, seasonal work and other characteristics of the individuals we observe. We also control for region by year fixed effects that vary by geographical area in more extended specifications. Furthermore, we can control for agricultural prices, which according to the historical narrative may have driven the reintroduction of serfdom; see, e.g., Christensen et al. (1934), Feldbak (1982) and Dombernowsky (1988).  \n\nWe find a sizeable, negative impact on the wages of farmhands using the difference-indifferences approach. In our baseline result, we find that farmhands experienced wages that were around $30\\%$ lower than they otherwise would have been compared to those of other groups in the labour market after the introduction of serfdom.° Importantly, we can also provide evidence that there was no discernible differential trend between farmhand wages and those of other groups in the labour market prior to the reintroduction of serfdom. Yet, a concern with our identification strategy is that the wages of other occupations were also negatively affected by serfdom. To deal with this, we compare the evolution of farmhand wages with those of unskilled workers in Scania, a province in Sweden, which is geographically and institutionally close to Denmark, but was not subject to serfdom. Moreover, Scania had been under Danish rule until the midseventeenth century. We further complement this analysis with suggestive evidence on reduced opportunities for apprenticeships for young men from rural areas, after serfdom was introduced using individual-level data for apprentices in the Danish city of Odense.  \n\nThis paper thus makes at least two contributions. First, we provide new evidence on the effects of monopsony power on wages by exploiting the introduction of serfdom as our quasi-experiment. The study most closely resembling our paper in terms of method is that of Naidu et al. (2016), who considered a positive shock to labour mobility in the United Arab Emirates using monthly data over a four-year period, demonstrating that visa policies for immigrant workers can result in substantial monopsony power by restricting job-to-job transitions. In our case, we consider almost a century's worth of data over a period when similar restrictions were implemented on a national scale. We thus study the long-run impact of this negative shock to mobility on wages of domestic farmhands, and an example of increased rather than decreased monopsony power. We also note that this is a case in which the historical narrative strongly suggests that estate owners had more monopsony power in the serfdom period.7 Our case also clearly demonstrates the negative impact monopsony power can have on wages and the welfare of workers as caused by reduced mobility. This is in line with theory that suggests that monopsony power is negatively related to how mobile workers are across locations; see Mendez and Van Patten (forthcoming).8  \n\nSecond, we contribute to the literature on the effects of serfdom and the broader literature on institutions and policies that restrict labour mobility. While there are many historiographical analyses of serfdom (Domar, 1970; North and Thomas, 1971; Brenner, 1976), there is relatively little quantitative evidence on the effects of serfdom on labour market outcomes for Western Europe, where serfdom usually ended in the early sixteenth century and where data are largely unavailable. Some evidence exists for Eastern Europe (as discussed below) where the emancipation of the peasantry came much later; see, e.g., Persson and Sharp (2015, pp. 90-7). That Denmark was an exception is also confirmed by Rudé (1972, p. 31), who referred to Denmark as the ^only major exception to the sharp east-west antithesis'. Thus, studying the reintroduction of serfdom in Denmark offers a unique possibility to investigate the impact of serfdom on a Western European country.? Another interesting feature of Danish serfdom was that the rules were gradually changed to pertain to larger age groups. In 1733, serfdom implied that a farmhand in the age group 14-36 years could not leave the estate to which he belonged from birth. The age group was extended to 9-40 years in 1742, and to 4 40 in 1764. The reform of 1788 meant that the age group was yet again 14-36 years. This allows us not only to investigate the immediate effect of serfdom under the 1733 rules, but we can also dig into whether tightening the rules was effective. It should be emphasised, however, that by investigating the impact of the 1733 serfdom in Denmark, what we look at is only one element of what is regarded as serfdom by many scholars, namely restrictions on mobility. This is not because other features often regarded as part of this institution did not exist, as we discuss in more detail below. Yet, they were not a part of the reform we consider. Nevertheless, in the context of this study, we also note that it is an advantage in terms of identification that we can exploit variation in—and consider the consequences of—just one of the dimensions of an economy with serfdom, namely the mobility of farmhands. Moreover, mobility restrictions are included in most definitions of serfdom.  \n\nThus, we contribute to the quantitative literature on the effects of monopsony, the effects of serfdom, as well as to the broader literature on institutions and policies that restrict labour mobility.10 We discuss these studies in a literature review in Section 1. Following this, Section 2 gives a brief history of serfdom in Denmark. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy, Section 4 describes the data and Section 5 presents the analysis, and offers interpretations and discusses mechanisms, and Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 1. Literature Review  \n\nIn this section, we discuss how serfdom has been defined in the historiographical literature and how the Danish form relates to this. We then review existing empirical studies of monopsony, serfdom and labour coercion.  \n\n### 1.1.Definitions of Serfdom and the Danish Case  \n\nMuch work on serfdom includes the observation that there is no uniform definition. For example, Blum (1961, p. 6) argued that ‘Serfdom $\\textit{l...}\\textit{J}$ defies easy explanation', and that the word 'serf , or its equivalent, was applied to a wide range of European peasants, from people whose condition could scarcely be distinguished from that of chattel slaves to men who were nearly free. Moreover, he argued that ^often the serf is thought to have been a person who was bound to the soil' . Similarly, in the Oxford Encyclopedia of Economic History, Rigby (2003, p. 463) stated that ^the precise form taken by serfdom cannot be specified in advance but must be established empirically for each particular time and place', but did however emphasise that legal restrictions on the right of movement are typically part of the whole serfdom package.11 O'Rourke (2017, p. 423) similarly argued that ^there was no single system of serfdom'.  \n\nIt is perhaps, therefore, no surprise that definitions of serfdom also vary in the literature. In his typology of serfdom around the Baltic Sea, Schmidt (1997) concluded that the common denominator was a restriction on the mobility of the farming population in order to maintain them as labourers at the manorial demesnes or as payers of land rent. Persson (2014, p. 228) also viewed restrictions on mobility as the essence of serfdom, and stated that ^serfdom was essentially a way for a landowner to deny or restrict labour mobility'. Yet, others such as Blanning (1983, p. 20) viewed this as an attenuated form of serfdom. Ogilvie and Carus (2014, p. 474), drawing largely on the experience of Russia and Eastern European countries, described serfdom as follows:  \n\na serf was legally tied to the landlord in a variety of ways, typically by being prohibited from migrating, marrying, practicing certain occupations, selling certain goods, participating in factor and product markets, or engaging in particular types of consumption without obtaining permission from his landlord.  \n\nAs is readily seen, this definition means that serfdom includes more than just restrictions on mobility. Field (1994, p. 50) argued that the essence of Russian serfdom was the subjection of the serfs to the arbitrary power of their master or mistress. This included, e.g., the selling of serfs. Yet, he also mentioned that a second element of serfdom was ^ascription', which meant that a serf could only travel from his home with his master's permission. Markevich and Zhuravskaya (2018) noted that the Russian government limited the right of migration of Russian peasants from the fifteenth century, and by 1649 migration had become a criminal offence.  \n\nThe Danish policy of adscription clearly fits better with the definitions that emphasise mobility restrictions. Moreover, it is probably best thought of as a milder form of serfdom or attenuated serfdom as suggested by some authors. Still, all definitions above emphasise mobility restrictions, which underlines that this is an important element of any definition of serfdom. Yet, while it was not a part of adscription, tenant farmers had obligations in terms of in-kind rent and boon work for their landlord, and in this way, other elements of labour coercion were also present (Lampe and Sharp, 2018). Yet, there was no permanent changes to these elements in the period considered.12 This shares similarity with the obligations of the serfs in Russia (Markevich and Zhuravskaya, 2018), but does not of course change the fact that serfdom in Denmark was different from Eastern European and Russian serfdom.  \n\n1.2. Existing Empirical Studies of Monopsony, Serfdom and Labour Coercion  \n\nGood overviews of existing studies of monopsony power can be found in Manning (2011; 2021), and we therefore refer the reader to his comprehensive reviews. Many of these studies exploit wage regulations to estimate the effect of wages on employment.13 As mentioned in the introduction, our paper takes an approach similar to Naidu et al. (2016) in that we exploit a shock to mobility and perform difference-in-differences estimation. Yet, we focus on a reduction in mobility of domestic farmhands, and can study the effects of reduced mobility over a much longer period. By studying the effect of a reform for a longer period, we gain the opportunity to look at both adaptation of workers to the reform as well as additional changes to a reform. Moreover, the responses to reduced mobility in terms of adaptation to increased mobility restrictions could be quite different from those from the abolition of mobility restrictions. It is also important to note that most of the literature on monopsony does not focus on agriculture. Yet, theoretical work by Raimondos (1993) asserts that there is monopsony in agricultural markets in developing countries. Mendez and Van Patten (forthcoming) examined the case of the United Fruit Company as one large firm with monopsony power in an agricultural setting.  \n\nRegarding empirical studies on serfdom, Table A1 in the Online Appendix provides an overview of the most important studies. Domar and Machina (1984) provided a quantitative analysis of whether Russian serfdom was unprofitable, by investigating whether the prices of serfs were similar across regions and different from zero in the 1850s. They observed some differences across regions, but in most places, prices were positive. This indicates that serfdom was not unprofitable. Klein and Ogilvie (2016) linked the intensity of serfdom across Bohemian villages, and showed that there is a single peaked relationship to non-agricultural occupational activities. In relation to the empirical analysis, Klein and Ogilvie (2016, p. 509) used ^the presence of village holdings currently used or occupied by the landlord’ as a proxy for the intensity of serfdom. They argued that manorial presence on village holdings captures the intensity of landlord's interest, information and control over villager's economic choices.  \n\nAshraf et al. (2018) built a model to explain the abolition of serfdom based on the idea that skilled labour became more important for fostering the return to physical capital. This led elites to abolish labour coercion in favour of employing free skilled workers. They showed that Prussian regions with more water mills as their proxy for physical capital had fewer serfs. Their measurement of serfs is based on emancipation from servile duties. None of these works relate directly to restrictions on mobility.14  \n\nNafziger (2012) and Buggle and Nafziger (2021) studied whether serfdom had effects even after abolition in the Russian case. Nafziger (2012) found relatively modest negative effects on mobility out of agriculture, whereas Buggle and Nafziger (2021) found evidence of long-run persistent effects on well-being and economic development using Russian data. Our study speaks to the immediate effects of serfdom on labour mobility and not the long-run effects. Malinowski (2016) studied the case of Poland, and defined serfdom as being present in areas in which peasants did not enjoy legal protection from the state against their landlords. He found that serfdom defined in this way is associated with higher urban growth in the face of market disintegration. Finally, Markevich and Zhuraskaya (2018) used a difference-in-differences strategy, which exploits the variation produced by abolishing serfdom and the intensity of serfdom across Russian regions.15  \n\nThey found that agricultural productivity, industrial production and peasant nutrition all increased after serfdom was abolished.  \n\nUnlike the studies reviewed above, we provide an evaluation of the effect of the introduction of serfdom on wages. In addition, we use micro-level data rather than more aggregate provincialor regional-level data, and we focus on a case from Western Europe.  \n\nWhile our study is related to the literature on serfdom, we mentioned in the introduction that some contributions have considered other coercive labour market institutions. We provide an overview of the most relevant studies in Table A2 in the Online Appendix. The studies by Naidu (2010) and Naidu and Yuchtman (2013) are closest to the present work, in the sense that they also apply difference-in-differences estimations and consider restrictions on mobility in different settings. Naidu (2010) estimated the effect of anti-enticement laws on wages by using US state-level data. He also employed individual census data to estimate the effect on the return to experience. He found negative effects on wages of mobility restrictions. Naidu and Yuchtman (2013) employed county-level wages to estimate the effect of abolishing criminal sanctions on breach of contract. They found a positive effect on wages. The study by Bobonis and Morrow (2014) considered education as the outcome, and they found that education did not respond to changing coffee prices during the coercive regime, whereas increased coffee prices in the noncoercive regime decreased education. Dippel et al. (2020) considered data for British colonies in the West Indies, and found that higher sugar export shares are associated with lower wages of agricultural workers, and higher sugar prices associated with higher wages. Gupta and Swamy (2017) considered migration to the Assam plantations in India and the association to the price of tea. Higher tea prices are associated with higher migration, but if more coercive contracts are used in a district, this response is weakened. The latter two papers considered workers who are mobile. We emphasise that none of these studies employ micro-level wage data to investigate the effect of the introduction of a coercive policy.  \n\n## 2. Historical Background  \n\nThis section briefly details the history of serfdom in Denmark to inform our investigation of its labour market implications. We first discuss the early serfdom that applied to only part of the country (the eastern islands of Zealand, Lolland and Falster). Next, we discuss the introduction of serfdom over the whole country in 1733. Finally, we discuss the changes made to serfdom during the eighteenth century.  \n\n### 2.1. Early Serfdom—Vornedskab  \n\nAt the end of the fifteenth century, a form of serfdom termed ^vornedskab’ was established on the eastern islands of Denmark.16 As is also true for the 1733 serfdom, it was directed at male farmhands. Christensen et al. (1934, p. 40) noted that the sons of farmhands were tied to the same estates as their fathers, and were thus not at liberty to move, although they were not the property of the landlord. Thus, if the farmhand was able to raise enough money to pay a fee, he could be allowed to work elsewhere. Nevertheless, while farmhands under vornedskab were not slaves,  \n\nChristensen et al. (1934) mentioned that the buying and selling of farmhands by landlords did in fact take place. While there were earlier attempts at abolishing this form of serfdom, it was not until 1702 that this was finally enacted,17 and then only for children born after August 25, 1699. This led Munch (1974, p. 308) to conclude that the abolition did not have any effect until 1717, when the first free workers were able to enter the labour market. 18  \n\n### 2.2. Reintroduction of Serfdom  \n\nSerfdom was reintroduced in 1733 for all males in the age group 14-36 years old, and this time for the entire country.19 More precisely, serfdom was reintroduced on February 4, 1733, when a royal decree declared that any peasant of age 36 or younger was not allowed to leave the estate on which he was born if the landlord had work for him.20 From 1735, it was made clear that the intended group was 14-36 years of age, although the original decree might have signified that originally by using the word bondekarl (peasant), which indicates someone who is clearly not a young child (Holmgaard, 2003, p. 28).21 The reintroduction was mainly aimed at ensuring farmhands for the estates, but in principle every male peasant in the age group 14 to 36 years was now tied to an estate.22  \n\nAccording to Olsen (1933, p. 63), the main motivation was to ensure low wages in the agricultural sector as run by the estates. Prior to 1733, farmhands had become freer at least de jure (Olsen, 1933, p. 64) due to the abolition of the early serfdom, vornedskab, on the eastern islands. Yet, in the western part of the country, farmhands had not been limited in their mobility prior to 1733 to the same extent. The introduction of serfdom has also been associated with scarcity of labour as compared to land (Holmgaard, 2003), in line with earlier work by Domar (1970). Yet, serfdom was introduced by the political system, which Domar himself acknowledged is not in his model. Moreover, as pointed out by Simonsen (1988), Danish historians have in general been rather dismissive of the complaints by the landlords regarding labour scarcity, and have rather interpreted this as an attempt to repress wages. Nevertheless, if the agricultural crisis or the end of vornedskab were creating conditions of labour scarcity, this should have shown up in wages, for which reason we investigate below whether there were early impacts on the wages of farmhands prior to serfdom. Another theory put forward by Holmgaard (1990) suggests that the introduction of serfdom is related to the (temporary) abolition of the country militia in 1730. As young peasants were no longer required to serve, some seem to have decided to be drafted into the army rather than work on an estate (Holmgaard, 1990, pp. 248-50). On the other hand, the country militia is also believed to have caused young peasants to fee the country, so in principle its abolition could have increased the number of available farmhands.  \n\nWhatever the case, a process during which it was argued that the freedom of the peasants had to be constrained was set in motion, culminating in the introduction of serfdom in 1733, which was formally enacted by re-establishing the country militia.23 This came with the requirement to keep a register of all males of ages 14-36, which could be used to keep track of the farmhands in the relevant age group (Skrubbeltrang, 1978, p. 185).24 Since the landlord could choose to enrol anybody who was not a tenant farmer in the militia (which by all accounts was not an experience most people desired), it has been argued that this threat was an important means of control for the landlords, allowing them to pressure young farmers into taking over otherwise undesirable or poorly maintained vacant farms (Skrubbeltrang, 1978). In fact, even stronger forms of serfdom in which the peasants would become the actual property of the estate owners were also proposed to the king (Holmgaard, 1990, p. 259), giving some support to the idea that the introduction of serfdom was mostly driven by a desire on the side of the estate owners to reduce the mobility of its labour force and increase monopsony power, rather than actual labour scarcity.25 Figure 1 shows the data for farmhands and other occupations for the period from 1705 to 1799. We plot the (average) log of wages for both groups and the difference in log wages between the two groups. Figure 1 suggests that, although farmhands experienced average wage increases prior to serfdom, and after the abolition of the country militia, so too did those of other groups.26 However, with the reintroduction of serfdom in 1733 until the end of the 1740s, farmhands appear to have experienced substantial decreases in wages compared to other groups.27 While the raw data fail to control for composition effects within the groups, the visual impression suggests nevertheless that average wages among farmhands did fall. We test more formally for an effect below.  \n\nThe reintroduction of serfdom has also been associated with falling agricultural prices following the Great Northern War of 1709-20 (Christensen et al., 1934; Feldbak, 1982; Dombernowsky,  \n\n![](images/42a00546b121c4d5339e1fd728c067349c0cc7b561c5d14faeb5146f64635701.jpg)  \nFig. 1.Average (Log) Wages for Farmhands and Other Occupations, 1705-99. Notes: The y-axis variables are the average natural log of wages for farmhands and other occupations (the control group) as well as the difference between the two. The vertical lines respectively represent 1730 (the year when the land militia was abolished), 1733 (the year serfdom was introduced), 1742 (the first year serfdom was tightened), 1764 (the second year serfdom was tightened) and 1788 (the year the rules returned to those of 1733). The dashed horizontal line segments show the average difference in log wages for the periods before and after serfdom and the periods after which serfdom was tightened. The original wage data are nominal day wages measured in the Danish unit skilling.  \n\n1988), that turned into an agricultural crisis leading farmhands to leave the estates.28 When we plot our data for the (natural logarithm of the) barley price along with (the natural logarithm of) farmhand wages in Figure 2, we find that, in the aggregate, grain prices were falling in the years prior to the reintroduction of serfdom.29 Yet, we note that the barley price was starting to increase from the 1730s. Moreover, barley prices were increasing in the 1730s at the same time as farmhand wages were decreasing. We also note that barley prices seem to be slowly increasing in the 1740s. Olsen (1950) argued that the 1740s was a period in which demand for grain was increasing, and this may arguably also be the reason that farmhand wages experience a rebound in the 1740s, yet he also mentioned that the cattle plague in the mid-1740s and late 1750s may have exacerbated this increase. This suggests that it is unlikely that agricultural prices were driving the reintroduction of serfdom, yet they could have driven wages.30 Therefore, we control for the barley price in some estimations.  \n\n![](images/4df45e26a4c711238d98d9de8ee97bb31a93355cea03479eb10e92c15b1099aa.jpg)  \nFig.2.Average $(L o g)$ Barley Prices and Farmhand Wages. Notes: The y-axis variables are the average natural log of the wages for farmhands and the average natural log of the price of barley. The vertical lines respectively represent 1730 (the year when the land militia was abolished), 1733 (the year serfdom was introduced), 1742 (the first year serfdom was tightened), 1764 (the second year serfdom was tightened) and 1788 (the year the rules returned to those of 1733). The original wage data are nominal day wages measured in the Danish unit skilling.  \n\nIn Figure 1, we compare to other occupations than farmhands. Given that serfdom affected everyone in the labour market, this may raise the question as to whether this is a good control group. To address this, we plot the wages of farmhands and compare them to unskilled labourers from the province Scania in Southern Sweden in Figure 3. Scania was under Danish rule until 1658 and shared a long institutional history. Scania and Denmark also have similar climate and soil conditions; and language and culture were similar.31 Both countries were subject to absolutism in the eighteenth century, while serfdom obviously represents an institutional difference. Moreover, Scania's agrarian ownership and labour relations were quite like those in Denmark, with significant landed estates and demesne production (Olsson and Morell, 2010, p. 324). There were no major changes in the way the Scanian labour market functioned after the change of nationality. On the contrary, the similarities with Denmark to a certain extent were reinforced; some Scanian landlords even tried to practice Zealand-style serfdom at their estates during the 1690s, long after Swedish law had been implemented (Fabricius, 1958, pp. 112-3; Olsson, 2003). Sweden has been characterised as having a \\*mercantilist labour market regime’ during the period of study. The basic patterns prevailed during the whole eighteenth century; people without property or occupation were subject to laga forsvar, which meant compulsory year-long service, at the same time as the right to quit for a new employer was emphasised. Moreover, the wages of day labourers were not regulated, whereas this was the case for servant's wages (Lundh, 2002, pp. 48-59; Uppenberg, 2018, p. 113). Using the Scanian comparison group, we see that farmhands in Denmark suffered a reduction in (log) wages from the 1730s, whereas this does not seem to happen for unskilled labourers in Scania. We note that wages seem to increase in the serfdom period in Scania, and this could suggest that the differences in wages are driven by other factors. Yet, when we make a real wage comparison, the real wage in Scania seems fairly constant, whereas that for Denmark decreases; see Figure 4. Thus, while our main analysis will focus on data from Denmark, we show below that the results also hold when we use this comparison.  \n\n![](images/9002247618714b988d009945d9499598ca488eca2149f4b4a03167f5c46633d9.jpg)  \nFig. 3.

The vertical lines respectively represent 1730 (the year when the land militia was abolished), 1733 (the year serfdom was introduced), 1742 (the first year serfdom was tightened), 1764 (the second year serfdom was tightened) and 1788 (the year the rules returned to those of 1733). The original wage data are nominal day wages measured in the Danish and Swedish unit skilling.  \n\nAs noted above, vornedskab was gradually abolished on Zealand, and so, by February 1733, all farmhands of age 33 years or below were no longer subject to it (Skrubbeltrang, 1978). Moreover, farmhands whose parents had migrated from Jutland and Funen had been free of vornedskab (Skrubbeltrang, 1978, p. 178). This means that the effect of serfdom might plausibly have been smaller on Zealand as it would not affect all those aged between 33 and 36. We investigate this in our difference-in-differences analysis below and find that the effect is negative for both subsamples.32  \n\n### 2.3. Tightening and Abolition of Serfdom  \n\nFrom 1742, serfdom was tightened to the age group 9-40 years old. Further edicts from the 1740s link the reduced mobility to the presence of cattle plague (Christensen et al., 1934, p. 75). From 1764, serfdom was further tightened to the age group 4-40 years. As part of wider agrarian reforms, serfdom reverted to the 1733 version in 1788 and was finally abolished in 1800.33 Tightening the rules could have been an endogenous response to problems with, for example, runaways leaving the country. Yet, if we consider the 1742 changes, Holmgaard (2003, p. 31) noted that a main reason given by the estate owners for changing the rules was not that they were being broken, but rather that males younger than 14 years of age were leaving the estate in order to avoid serfdom. He also found, however, based on a review of primary evidence, that this was only happening to a very limited extent.34 Returning to Figure 1, we do not see a clear effect of the 1742 tightening, but note that the wage differential between farmhands and other occupations is at its lowest for the period 1742-64. Yet, we also note that the tightening was a smaller shock compared to the initial one. Similarly, the data for the period 1705-99 fails to reveal any visible effects of the 1764 tightening.35  \n\n![](images/d52bf02308472dcf9760d3f72c76f4262df54ae23caf527edcf7506e48b82f36.jpg)  \nFig.4.Comparison of Average Log Real Wages in Denmark and Scania,1705-99. Notes: The y-axis variables are the average natural log of the real wages for farmhands and the average natural log of the unskilled workers in Scania. The vertical lines respectively represent 1733 (the year serfdom was introduced), 1742 (the first year serfdom was tightened), 1764 (the second year serfdom was tightened) and 1788 (the year the rules returned to those of 1733). The original wage data are nominal day wages measured in the Danish and Swedish unit skilling.  \n\n## 3. Data  \n\nHere, we describe how we obtain our measure of individual wages as well as an indication of which individuals are unskilled farmhands. Fortunately, it turns out that, for the eighteenth century, a vast amount of data was collected by the Danish Price History Project, which was started at the University of Copenhagen in 1939 and terminated in 2004. The wage data are referenced and briefy summarised in volume II of the History of Prices and Wages in Denmark  \n\n![](images/0cf88d72b7f20e45ae4d748ee3426632134b9fd6583b243702f8ab63dfe77ee4.jpg)  \nFig.5. Map of Denmark and Scania with the Locations of Estates in Our Sample. Notes: The white dots identify the locations of estates and places in the Kingdom of Denmark and Scania in our dataset in a geographical information system map. The dark grey area identifies the Kingdom of Denmark. The light grey area identifies Scania. The white area to the south of Denmark identifies the region of Schleswig and Holstein. Source: Geographical coordinates collected by the authors.  \n\n1660-1800 (Friis and Glamann, 1958; Andersen and Pedersen, 2004). The data come from manorial accounts (Andersen and Pedersen, 2004, p. 16) and the period covered overlaps that when serfdom was reintroduced.36 They represent a unique dataset on labour and product markets during that time. Jensen et al. (2021) detailed how the wage data are harmonised at the individual level, and it should be noted that they have been corrected for in-kind payments (also documented in the data).37 The Scanian data are documented by Gary (2018).  \n\nGiven the extensive use of patronymic surnames, we are unfortunately not able to track individuals across time, but we have data for individuals working for a total of 16 estates38 across the regions of Funen, Jutland and Zealand in the full dataset covering 1705-99; see Figure 5 for a map of Denmark with the estates marked and Table A3 in the Online Appendix for a list of the estates. We restrict ourselves to these years since the data are very thin before and after. Thus, the dataset consists of repeated cross sections available at an annual level. For measuring whether a person is a farmhand, we use the fact that we have information on occupation, which we have coded according to the HIsCO system (van Leeuwen et al., 2002). We code as farmhands those who are designated as ‘farm labourers', ‘day labourers’ and “labourers'39 as our baseline, but also consider specifications in which we only use farm labourers', which arguably captures most closely those who worked the field.  \n\nTable A4 in the Online Appendix summarises the available data for the three regions of Jutland, Funen and Zealand. While we have observations for all three regions in the four periods, eight estates do not have any observations in the period that contains the reintroduction of serfdom (1705-41), and we therefore only have 731 observations for this period. The data become thicker over time and are thickest for the period 1764-87. The Danish price history does not provide detailed descriptions of who these labourers were, but it indicates that the day labourers working in the field were usually cotters renting a house, often with a small field. They had to work as farmhands with a contract for six or 12 months. The day labourers would receive money wages and, if they worked on medium sized farms, they would typically receive payment in kind (Andersen and Pedersen, 2004, pp. 19-20). Skrubbeltrang (1978, p. 143) mentioned that threshers would not be subject to the contract requirement and could be hired at any time. The data may also include farmhands who were allowed to work on other estates (Olsen, 1950) for wages on a temporary basis. However, we stress that, given that landlords had the right to make the local peasants stay to farm the land on their estates, the wages of those who could move even temporarily were also likely to have been affected. In Table A5 in the Online Appendix, we provide a list of the 30 occupations of which we have at least 100 observations in the dataset, to provide an impression of other occupational categories,40 which include craftsmen such as bricklayers and carpenters, as well as teachers for example.  \n\nBesides occupations and wages, the data also provide information on gender, the season of the year that the work was carried out, job title (master or ordinary craftsman), whether the individual was a child, and the location of the individual as given by region and estate.41  \n\n## 4. Empirical Strategy  \n\nWe employ a difference-in-differences estimation on a dataset covering the period 1705-99. We estimate a standard difference-in-differences model, which treats the reintroduction of serfdom as a single period (1733 to 1799). We proceed by estimating the following equation for the period 1705-99 for the natural logarithm of wages as denoted by $\\ln w_{i t}$  \n\n$$\n\\ln w_{i t}=F a r m h a n d_{i t}S e r f d o m_{1733}\\beta+\\alpha_{t}+X_{i t}^{\\prime}\\gamma+\\varepsilon_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nHere $i$ indicates individual and $t$ indicates year; Farmhand $\\mathbf{\\chi}_{i t}^{\\prime}$ is a dummy variable that indicates whether the individual observed is a farmhand; and $S e r f d o m_{1733}$ is a dummy that is equal to 1 from 1733-99 and which is equal to 0 otherwise. The parameter of interest is $\\beta$ , which measures the impact of serfdom on the farmhands and can be interpreted as a measure of monopsonistic power of the manor.42 The variable $\\alpha_{t}$ indicates year fixed effects; $X_{i t}$ is a vector of control variables that include fixed effects for occupations (as described above), region fixed effects, gender fixed effects, seasonal fixed effects and other control variables; and $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ is the error term. We include region fixed effects since the literature argues that the group of estate owners must have comprised a kind of employer organisation at the regional level, and they may have had some agreements on wages (Andersen and Pedersen, 2004, p. 46). Similarly, Skrubbeltrang (1940, p. 239) wrote that differences in wages were regional and that differences between estates in a region were minor. Andersen and Pedersen (2004) further argued that there must have been competition between estates to secure the most necessary and, especially, the best labourers even in the serfdom period. They noted that the son of a wealthy copyholder might secure a passport to leave if he had received a better offer from a neighbouring manor' (p. 47).43 Andersen and Pedersen (2004, p. 90) further argued that  \n\nTable 1.

Most other variables are taken from Boberg-Fazlic et al. (2020) except the last three variables, which were coded by the authors using data from the website of the Danish Research Centre for Manorial Studies (https:/herregaardsforskning.dk).  \n\n[ . .. ] a kind of bargaining did take place, where wages were determined in a process of negotiation between non-equals: a process which, all the same, even the most assertive landowner ignored at his peril, despite being backed by an absolutist government. Adscription or not, no manor was an island, and  \n\n42 The coeficient $\\beta$ can be interpreted a a negative meaure of the monopsonistie power, with the degree of this measure usually computed as a ratio of the wedge between the value of the marginal product of labour, and the wage effectively paid and the latter measure (see, e.g., Boeri and van Ours, 2021).  \n\n43 Unfortunaely, according to Logstrup (1987), litle systematic evidence on passports exs, as passports would allow farmhands to leave for better paid jobs at other estates. Yet, the available circumstantial examples of prices suggest that they could be quite high. Logstrup (1987) gave an example of a price of passport of 300 rigsdaler for someone who was acquiring a farm that cost 4o0 rigsdaler. If the presence of a passport would mean that more productive workers could move to a better paid job in the region, this would tend tolower the effect of the serfdom.  \n\nneither was it a forced labour camp where manorial authority could dictate wage levels. At the most basic level, labourers had to survive physically, particularly in periods of rising prices.  \n\nThus, we believe that there are good reasons to assume that labour markets would have strong regional components. Yet, we do explore specifications with estate fixed effects. As mentioned above, we control for fixed effects for years and occupation. This means that we exploit differences across time combined with differences across occupations. By controlling for year fixed effects, we capture any overall impact of introducing serfdom, and by controlling for occupation, we control for any time-invariant impact of being a farmhand. We then ultimately exploit the fact that there is a differential impact of serfdom on farmhands. The crucial identifying assumption is that log wages would be on parallel trends for farmhands and other occupations in the absence of serfdom. We therefore present event studies to evaluate the plausibility of the common trend assumption. The event studies show the estimated coefficients on the interaction between a dummy for being a farmhand and time dummies. We also assume that the introduction of serfdom is the only relevant shock for understanding the changes in relative wages. Clearly, apart from the aforementioned shock to grain prices, which we control for below, other shocks to institutions might therefore be a threat to identification, but we are not aware of any that would have differentially affected farmhands. Yet we note that year fixed effects capture common shocks.44  \n\nWe estimate our main equation on the data for Denmark only using variation across occupations and time. Yet, as an alternative difference-in-differences strategy, we compare the wages of farmhands to those of unskilled workers in Scania, i.e., we estimate the above equation with Danish farmhands as the treated group and unskilled, Scanian workers as the control group.  \n\n## 5. Results  \n\nThis section presents the results from the estimation of our equation of interest using our main dataset on Danish estates. All SEs are clustered at the level of the estate or alternatively at the occupational level.  \n\nWe begin by showing an event study in which we have divided the period 1705 to 1799 into 19 periods. The excluded period is 1705-9, and all periods contain five years except the periods 1725-32 and 1733-4. We note that the coefficients become systematically negative from the period 1735-9, and significantly so in periods 1740-4, 1745-9, 1780-4 and 1785-9. Importantly, for the design, there is no discernible trend prior to 1733-4. When we implement the same design using Scanian unskilled workers as the control group, we obtain more significant results, arguably because the Scanian control group was not negatively affected. For this reason, we interpret the results using Danish data only as conservative.  \n\nIn addition to the event study in Figure 6, we have also estimated the fexible model for males only (see Online Appendix Figure A4), and the fully fexible model in which the farmhand dummy is interacted with year dummies (see Online Appendix Figure A5). Both give similar results to those we find in Figure 6. While the specification in Online Appendix Figure A5 is more extended, the results indicate that there are no negative and statistically significant coefficients prior to the reintroduction of serfdom in 1733, and the pattern of coefficients is such that most coefficients after 1732 are negative and significantly so in some of the years; see Online Appendix  \n\n![](images/0e2c4a3f472b8b1d5dc69d2655bb2ce8f72e40004cdfb723b60f1840c75991b4.jpg)  \nFig. 6. Event Study for the Introduction of Serfdom, Coeffcient on Farmhands Multiplied by Time Dummies. Notes: Coefficients obtained from the fexible form with $95\\%$ confidence interval using the Danish dataset. The omitted period is 1705-9. The periods all include five years except 1725 (1725-32) and 1733 (1733-4).  \n\nFigure A5. As we do not have many observations per year, the lack of significance is perhaps not surprising. As another way of estimating a flexible model, we have divided the data into regular five-year periods. We find a similar result to that with the yearly periods. Again, it is only for the periods that included the years of serfdom that we find negative and statistically significant coefficients; see Online Appendix Table A6.45  \n\nWe next discuss the main results as reported in Table 2. Column 1 shows a negative and statistically significant estimate of the interaction Farmhandu;Serfdom1733, which is consistent with the view that serfdom did indeed affect farmhands more strongly compared to other groups in the labour market. The estimate in column 1 implies that farmhands experienced wages that were $29.6\\%$ lower than they otherwise would have been compared to those of other groups in the labour market after the introduction of serfdom. We have also calculated that a farmhand could have bought 5.5 pounds of rye bread before serfdom, but that this declined to 3.42 under serfdom, although this was in part due to increased prices. In columns 2 and 3, we show the effect of spliting the sample between those regions that did not have serfdom prior to 1733 (Funen and Jutland) and those that had the early serfdom, vornedskab (Zealand and surrounding islands). We find negative coefficients for both subsamples, though the effect is more precisely estimated for those regions that did not have serfdom prior to 1733. The effect is still negative for the Zealand sample, though precision is smaller.46 In column 4, we add region-by-year effects separately. The estimate remains negative, but significance is reduced to the $10\\%$ level. The sign of the coefficient is nonetheless still negative, and we cannot reject that it is of similar magnitude to that reported in column 1. Since the mobility restrictions only applied to male farmhands, we check that the results are not driven by including women and children in the control group, and we find that this is not the case; see column (5) in Table 2. We have also tried to control for whether the worker received in-kind payments and find that this does not matter either; see column (6) of Table 2.  \n\nTable 2.

In Table 3, we first divide the control group into unskilled and low skilled on the one hand, and medium and high skilled on the other hand. In columns (1) and (2), we find negative and significant effects for farmhands with both control groups. In columns (3) and (4), we use men only and obtain similar results. We also investigate whether including certain occupations in the control group drives the results. This would be the case if other groups were also affected by serfdom. We also consider removing occupations with a substantial number of observations in the data set. This is true for teachers who worked on the estates. As these may have been more mobile than other groups during serfdom, including them in the control group could affect the results. The result in column (5) suggests that this is only so to a limited extent, since the effect remains negative and significant, as well as numerically similar. Excluding carpenters, farm servants or masons also has little effect, and the same is true for farm servants; see columns (6)-(8). We further investigate effects on these groups below.  \n\nWe have also re-estimated the baseline model on samples running from 1705-41, 1705-63 and 1705-87; see Online Appendix Table A7. We note that the coefficient of interest is negative for the initial period before the first tightening, but it is statistically insignificant; see column 1 in Table A7. Once we extend the sample to 1763 as in column 2, the coefficient is very like the baseline estimate (see column 4) and is also significant at the $5\\%$ level. The same is true when we extend the sample further to 1787; see column 3. The fact that we do not observe any effects using only the period before the rules were initially tightened, could be related to the fact that the sample is reduced to fewer than 800 observations. Once we increase the sample, we get much stronger results. Below, we report results suggesting that the effects on farm labourers were stronger than for the other unskilled labourers we use in our measures. If we use the farm labourer category as the treated category and men only, we find that the coefficient is larger than for our main result and statistically significant for all subperiods; see Online Appendix Table A8. This suggests that the result for the initial period is driven by low power, since when we use those labourers treated more intensely, the effect seems to get stronger. This is also corroborated by the fact that we find a statistically significant effect for the first period when we estimate our model on the full sample, as shown in Table 2.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Farmservants excluded C Carpenters excluded</td><td>-0.316** [-2.258] 20,472</td><td>0.641</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"7\">Teachers excluded 5 Medium and high skilled,menonly Non-skilled& unskilled,men only Medium and high skilled</td><td>-0.345** [2.153]</td><td>19,738 0.649</td></tr><tr><td>-0.300** [-2.527]</td><td>20,492 0.657</td></tr><tr><td>-0.306* [-1.803] ?</td><td>12,160 0.496</td></tr><tr><td>-0.414*** [3.516] 3</td><td>12,591 0.461</td></tr><tr><td>-0.318* [1.792]</td><td>12,816 0.526</td></tr><tr><td>-0.337** [-2.661]</td><td>14,109 0.615</td></tr><tr><td>Farmhandxserfdom</td><td>Observations</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWe also investigate the effect of using the six estates that have observations for the period before and after serfdom; see columns 5 to 8 in Online Appendix Table A7. While the effects are similar, the size and precision of estimates change. Given that the sample size is reduced, we note the importance of including all 16 estates to obtain sufficient precision of estimates. Again, when we use men only and farm labourers, the results are stronger; see Online Appendix TableA8.  \n\nWe next include additional control variables in Table 4. First, we investigate whether the price of grain (specifically barley, the most widely grown variety) could be the underlying factor driving wages and serfdom; see the discussion above. In column (2), we have included the average annual barley price observed at the level of the estate. If lower grain prices were driving serfdom and lower wages for farmhands, we would expect the coefficient to be positive. We find that the coefficient on (the natural logarithm of) the price of barley is positive, but not statistically significant. Moreover, although the coefficient on the interaction between the farmhand and the serfdom dummy is reduced compared to the baseline, it remains significant.47 Additionally, when we use the sample for which we have barley prices, we see that the lower coefficient is similar; see column (1). When we replace our measure of grain prices by the price of rye, the coefficient on the price of rye is negative and marginally significant at the $10\\%$ level; see column (3). This result runs counter to expectation, but is possibly driven by the fact that we have less complete data for this variable. Yet, these results suggest that our main result is not driven by differential developments in grain prices across estates.  \n\nWe also investigated the extent to which our results are driven by other ways in which serfdom affected wage development. Our identification relies on serfdom being mainly targeted at male farmhands. Other males could be restricted from moving as well, and so we control for other aspects of the environment. First, being close to the border might have implied that it was easier to run away, as suggested by Holmgaard (2003). Being closer to a market town or the coast were associated with higher wages after serfdom; see columns (4) and (5). These results suggest that in areas in which it was easier to escape, wages did increase after serfdom. Yet, the effect on farmhands after serfdom remains negative and significant in all three columns. When we control for distance to Schleswig-Holstein (the region across the border in the south of the Jutland peninsula) interacted with the serfdom dummy in column (6), and contrary to what Holmgaard suggests, the coefficient is positive. Yet, this could be related to the fact that part of the region south of the border had a stronger version of serfdom than the kingdom of Denmark. In column (7), we control for all three distance variables, and find that our conclusions are largely unchanged, although the point estimate on the farmhand interaction is now smaller.

All estimations include the same control variables as in column (1) of Table 2; these control variables are fixed effects for region, occupation, year and season, as well as dummy variables for whether an individual is a master craftsman, a woman or a child. Coefficients are reported with the robust $t\\cdot$ statistics in parentheses $^{\\infty.64\\times2\\times}p<0.01$ $^{**}p<0.05$ $^{*}p<0.1;$ SEs are clustered at the estate level.  \n\nNone of our distance variables, however, relate directly to competition between estates. Data from Boberg-Fazlic et al. (2020) on the location of 782 estates allow us to compute the number of estates within 10, 20, 30 and $40\\mathrm{km}$ from the estates in our data set. We use these data to compute a simple Herfindahl index with each estate getting equal weight.49 The results are reported in Table 5. We note that the estimate of the main effect remains negative and mostly significant, except when we consider the local market to be in a circle within $20\\mathrm{km}$ from the estate. Yet, the effect is still negative and significantly so when we consider 10, 30 and $40\\mathrm{km}$ .The main effect of competition is as expected, as a lower value of the Herfindahl index indicates more competition.  \n\nThe interaction effects are positive. The interactions with the serfdom dummy suggest that less concentrated markets experienced larger reductions in farmhand wages. One interpretation of this result is that estates in more concentrated markets gained more monopsony power after serfdom by cooperating with other estates on keeping track of workers, and thereby reducing their bargaining power.  \n\nNext, we investigate the extent to which local innovation affects the results and the extent to which they affect the impact of serfdom. We consider five different variables here. The first variables relate to the adoption of a new field system known as koppelwirtschaft and a new crop, namely clover. Koppelwirtschaft was introduced into Denmark in the eighteenth century (Boberg-Fazlic et al., 2020). This system required that the cultivated area was divided into at least seven fields. With, for example, 11 fields, the fields would be used in the following way: (1) fallow, (2) wheat or rye, (3) barley, (4) rye, (5) barley, (6) oats with clover, (7) clover for hay, (8) clover for hay and grazing, and (9)-(11) grazing; see, e.g., Bjorn (1988, pp. 35-7). We have collected data on the estates that introduced this field system. One measure is simply whether the system was introduced by 1782, whereas another measure used available sources to date the year in which it was introduced. Clover is often argued to have been introduced along with koppelwirtschaft, though this was not always the case. As discussed in Dall Schmidt et al. (2018), clover increased both crop yields and dairy production, and it could have affected wages. We have data on which estates adopted clover in 1775. As these innovations may have affected farmhand wages as well, we include interactions with these variables with the farmhand dummy. We have also coded dummies for the years in which the owner of the estate changed, when new buildings were finished and when other improvements were made on the estate.  \n\nThe results are shown in Table 6. In column (1), we show the result for controlling for adoption in 1782 of koppelwirtschaft and the interaction with the farmhand dummy. We find that the interaction has a positive coefficient, which is also significant at the $10\\%$ level. When we use the time-varying measure in column (2), we obtain a similar result. This is in line with one view in the historical narrative that the introduction of koppelwirtschaft increased the wages of farmhands (Rasmussen, 2010). Others have argued that koppelwirtschaft relied on serfdom as establishing and maintaining an 11-field system was labour intensive, and therefore may have required more forced labour.50 In column (3), we control for similar variables for clover adoption, but here we do not find any significant effects. In column (4), we add the dummy variables for owner change, building construction and other improvements. Owner changes are associated with lower wages in the year of the new owner. In column (5), we estimate a full model using the time-varying measure for koppelwirtschaft adoption. Results are similar to those in the other columns, and we note that our main variable is always significant at least at the $10\\%$ level in these estimations. Still, these innovations could be endogenous, and this should be kept in mind when interpreting the results in Table 6.  \n\nAn important question that we only answer tentatively is whether the intensity of serfdom as measured by the share of farmhands affected koppelwirtschaft adoption at the regional level. To evaluate this, we use a pseudo-panel approach explained below, and find that the share of farmhands after serfdom either negatively affected the regional share of estates that adopted serfdom or had no discernible effect.  \n\nTable 6.

All estimations include the same control variables as in column (1) of Table 1; these control variables are fixed effects for region, occupation, year and season, as well as dummy variables for whether an individual is a master craftsman, a woman or a child; coefficients are reported with the robust $t$ statistics in parentheses $^{***}p<0.01$ $^{**}p<0.05$ $^{*}p<0.1;$ SEs are clustered at the estate level.  \n\nThe fact that serfdom was tightened and then relaxed subsequently might influence the result, and we therefore also estimate a model in which we take advantage of this:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\ln w_{i t}=F a r m h a n d_{i t}P e r i o d_{1}\\beta_{1}+F a r m h a n d_{i t}P e r i o d_{2}\\beta_{2}+F a r m h a n d_{i t}P e r i o d_{3}\\beta_{3}}}\\ {{\\qquad+F a r m h a n d_{i t}P e r i o d_{4}\\beta_{4}+\\alpha_{t}+X_{i t}^{\\prime}\\gamma+\\varepsilon_{i t}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHere Periodi is a dummy equal to one in the years from 1733 to 1741, Period2 is a dummy equal to one in the period 1742-63, Period3 is a dummy equal to one in the period 1764-87 and Period4 is a dummy equal to one for the period 1788-99.  \n\nIn column 1 of Online Appendix Table A9, we look at whether there were any differential effects across the periods in which the restrictions were either tightened or loosened. Overall, the effects for the four subperiods seem similar and it cannot be rejected that they are the same.51 This result may seem surprising, but one reason that we do not see changes to the effect (e.g., that it becomes larger when rules are tightened) is that farmhands are adapting to the rules. Moreover, we noted above that there might have been a positive shock to demand for farmhands caused by increased demand for grains in the second period. Yet, we note that, when we use estate fixed effects, the data are consistent with a stronger adaptation effect, although, as noted below, using estate fixed effects likely absorbs part of the effect of serfdom. In column 2 of Online Appendix  \n\nTable A9, we investigate whether there are pre-existing trends in the form of the abolition of the early serfdom. The event studies suggested there were none, but as this would start to matter from 1717, when the first farmhands who were free of early serfdom turned 18 (see above), we interact a dummy for 1717-32 with the farmhand dummy and obtain a positive yet statistically insignificant estimate on this variable.52  \n\nIn column 3 of Online Appendix Table A9, we show results when we let the sample begin in the seventeenth century and end in 1799 (i.e., including years for 1661-5). Again, the result for the period of serfdom is similar to our baseline estimate. In column 4, we ask whether it matters that children are in the sample and find that it does not. In columns 5 and 6, we cluster at the level of the occupation in column 5 and use two-way clustering (for estate and occupation) in column 6. In column 7, we investigate whether differential effects on the three groups included in the serfdom measure are present.3 It might be the case that using just those we know for sure worked on the field produces stronger results. We investigate this by allowing for different effects of the three types of labourer. When we do so, we find that the coefficient on the farm labourer interaction is $-0.41$ and significant at the $5\\%$ level. For day labourers, it is $-0.34$ , but only significant at the $10\\%$ level. Finally, for labourers, the coefficient is $-0.257$ and significant at the $5\\%$ level. These results are suggestive of some differences, though statistically speaking we cannot tell whether this is in fact the case; see column 7 of Online Appendix Table A9.  \n\nIn Table 7, we investigate the extent to which unobservable estate characteristics drive our results. In the main analysis, we use region fixed effects, which capture larger regions. This is warranted for several reasons. First, the historical narrative suggests that labour markets were to some extent regional; see above. Second, in terms of institutional legacy, the larger regions capture the divide between regions which had the early serfdom and those which did not. Finally, we can observe data for all the regions before and after serfdom, which is where we get our time variation for our difference-in-differences estimation. This is not true for estates, as we observe only six estates before and after as discussed above. This means that some of the before and after variation will be captured by the estate fixed effects. Bearing this in mind, we nevertheless run the estimations with estate level fixed effects. In column (1), we allow the effect to vary by periods. The coefficients are negative for all periods, but only significant for the first period. This could suggest that farmhands adapted to serfdom or that other effects are distorting the result. In column (1), we show our baseline model and we note the effect is still negative, though imprecisely estimated. Yet, we note that the (adjusted) $R^{2}$ hardly increases compared to the baseline model. In column (3), we allow the effect of serfdom to vary by type of farmhand, and see that that there are negative effects for farm labourers and day labourers, which are both significant at the $10\\%$ level. The effect is positive, but non-significant for labourers. In column (4), we investigate what happens when we compare farm labourers to all non-farmhand occupations. The coefficient on the serfdom variable is negative and significant at the $5\\%$ level. In column (5), we replace farm labourers by labourers and find a positive non-significant coeffcient on the serfdom variable, as in column (3). In column (6), we find a negative coefficient on the serfdom variable for day labourers that is significant at the $10\\%$ level. In columns (7) to (9), we run regressions similar to those in columns (4) to (6), but now we let the coefficient vary by the four periods outlined earlier. We note that the coefficients are negative for all periods for farm labourers and day labourers, and significant in periods 1 to 3 for farm labourers, and significant for periods 1 and 2 for day labourers. For labourers, the coefficients are mostly small and significant, but in period 2, the coefficient is positive and significant. As we argued, the fixed effects for estates likely capture some part of the negative serfdom effect, which would go some way in explaining insignificance. Yet, the positive effects in columns (5) and (8) could be explained by increased demand for grains in the 1740s. If we control for log barley prices, the coefficient on the serfdom variable for labourers becomes negative though not significant, and the positive coefficient for the second period becomes insignificant. Moreover, controlling for log barley prices in the specification used in column (2), the coefficient becomes $-0.124$ and significant at the $10\\%$ level.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"10\">Dependent variable: log day wages -0.158**</td><td rowspan=\"10\">8 6 4 3 2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.704***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-4.774] -0.429* 1.951] [1.841]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.314* 0.0411 [0.816]</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.361**</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[-2.137] -0.265* [-1.755] 0.0278</td><td>[0.498] -0.306* [-1.904]</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0445 [-0.717]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[-2.701] -0.0139</td><td>-0.0599 [-0.861]</td><td>-0.0226 [-0.207]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Farm labourer × period 3</td></tr><tr><td>[-0.172]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Farm labourer X serfdom</td><td></td><td></td><td>Farm labourer × period 1</td></tr><tr><td>Farmhand × period 2</td><td>d×period3</td><td>Farmhand × period 4</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Labourer X serfdom</td><td>Day labourer × serfdom</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Farmhand × period 1</td><td>Farmhand</td><td></td><td>Farmhand x serfdom</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td> Farm labourer × period 2</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"6\"></td><td></td><td>9 一</td><td></td><td>-0.364** [-2.265] -0.455** [2.803] -0.312 [-1.687]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>-0.0728 [1.302] 0.146** [2.455] 0.0226 [0.329] -0.136 [-0.405]</td><td>17,638</td></tr><tr><td>E</td><td>-0.271 [1.730]</td><td></td><td>15,797 0.743</td></tr><tr><td>6 5</td><td></td><td></td><td>17,350 0.745</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td></td><td></td><td>17,638 0.688</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>15,797 0.743 20,927</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.670</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>20,927 0.670</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Farm labourer × period 4</td><td>Labourer × period 1</td><td>Labourer × period 2 Labourer × period 3</td><td>Day labourer × period 1 Labourer × period 4</td><td>Day labourer × period 2 Day labourer × period 3</td><td>Day labourer × period 4 Observations</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nOverall, our reading of the evidence is that estate-level effects do not explain the results, but that controlling for them adds substantial noise, and the results become more dependent on which samples and treatment group is used. This is hardly surprising, as estate fixed effects will absorb a lot of the variation in our data since we only have six estates for which fixed effects for estates can be estimated based on before and after data. In sum, we conclude that the estimated effect of serfdom is not driven by unobserved estate-level characteristics. Yet, we also note that with estate fixed effects, the estimated effect becomes smaller with time, which is consistent with farmhands adapting to serfdom.  \n\n### 5.1.Additional Results  \n\nWe report additional robustness checks in Table A10 in the Online Appendix. We investigate what happens when we replace farmhands by either teachers, bricklayers or carpenters in the differencein-differences variable in columns 1-3 of Table A10. We find that teachers had increasing wages after 1733, and to investigate whether any of the other occupations explain our main results, we run models that augment our baseline model by the three variables added in columns 1 to 3. As is clear, effects on other occupations do not explain those found for farmhands; see columns 4 to 6 in Online Appendix Table A10. We have also tried to include linear trends for these three occupations, and find that results are unchanged (see column 7) and controlled for them individually by multiplying the occupation by year fixed effects; see Online Appendix Figures A6-A8. This is further evidence that results are not driven by other groups being affected byserfdom.  \n\nThe nature of our dataset does not allow us to follow the single individual's dynamics of wage and personal characteristics over time and, thus, traditional panel techniques cannot be implemented.54 We deal with this by following the pseudo-panel technique introduced by Browning et al. (1985) and Deaton (1985). We create a synthetic data panel aggregating different cross sections into cohorts having the same characteristics. Given the information available in our dataset, we create six different cohorts, $c$ , based on the common fixed individual characteristics, i.e., the three regions55 and gender, obtaining an average of 67 observations per group. Then, we estimate the linear model  \n\n$$\n\\ln\\bar{w}_{c t}=\\overline{{F a r m h a n d}}_{c t}S e r f d o m_{1733}\\beta+\\bar{\\alpha}_{c}+\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}+\\bar{X}_{c t}\\gamma+\\bar{u}_{c t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\ln{\\bar{w}_{c t}}$ and $\\Bar{X}_{c t}$ are the average in cohort $c$ in year $t$ of log wages and the control variables; $\\overline{{F a r m h a n d}}_{c t}$ is the share of farmhands; $\\Bar{\\alpha}_{c}$ represents cohort fixed effects and ${\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}$ represents year fixed effects.  \n\nOnline Appendix Table A11 displays the results of the estimation based on the pseudo-panel allowing for different fixed effects. Also, in this case, the $\\beta$ coefficient is negative and significant. Moreover, Online Appendix Table A12 displays the results for a model in which the share of estates adopting koppelwirtschaft at the regional level is used as the outcome. The results show that the effect of serfdom was either negative or close to zero.  \n\nOnline Appendix Table A13 corrects the SEs for spatial correlation, where log wages at an estate are allowed to correlate with the log wages of other estates placed within $40\\mathrm{km}$ .Ascan be seen from the table, this correction makes the results more significant.  \n\n5.2. Alternative Control Groups: Urban Unskilled Workers from Copenhagen and Unskilled WorkersfromScania  \n\nIt is possible that using other occupations than farmhands bias the results, as other groups in the labour market may have experienced a negative (or positive) effect on their wage because of serfdom. If the effect on the wages of non-farmhands was also negative, we would underestimate the effect on farmhands.  \n\nTo investigate this possibility, we first compare the evolution of the wages of farmhands to the wages of unskilled workers from the Danish capital Copenhagen. The capital was not subject to serfdom, and so this group of workers would only be indirectly affected by serfdom in the sense that flows of rural workers would be smaller. The comparison suggests that the wages of farmhands fell relative to those of unskilled workers in Copenhagen, as seen in Figure 7, which shows the comparison from 1731 to 1799. It should be noted that we see both a decrease in farmhand wages and an increase in wages of unskilled urban workers. The latter increase could be explained by a lower flow of workers from rural areas.  \n\nTo further investigate this, we have also estimated a version of our model in which we compare the wages of farmhands to the wages of unskilled labour in Scania in Southern Sweden. As we have seen above, Scania shared some important traits with Denmark, with the crucial difference being that it never experienced serfdom. Most of the Swedish data come from the city of Malm?, but they also include some rural areas. Figure 5 includes the Scanian locations used, and we have already given a preview of these data in Section 2. For a detailed description, see Gary (2018).  \n\nWe begin the analysis by showing the event study for log wages in Figure 8. This figure is like Figure 6, but we now compare to unskilled Scanian labourers defined by the same HISCO codes as those we use for farmhands. We note that a negative effect is visible in the period 1735-9 and significantly so from the period 1740-4. Moreover, the common pre-trend assumption appears plausibly satisfied. There are no significant differences prior to serfdom, and if anything, Danish wages were increasing in the period just prior to serfdom. This would tend to work against us.  \n\nIn Table 8, we show the simple difference-in-differences estimates using three different ways to compare log wages. In column (1), we base the comparison on Danish to Swedish skilling. In column (2), we have used an exchange rate correction using annual data from Abildgren (2018). Since the Swedish currency depreciated against the Danish, the effect is smaller, but still negative and significant. In column (3), we have deflated the wages by consumer price indices from Abildgren (2018) for Danish wages, and Edvinsson and Soderberg (2010) for the Scanian wages. We find the effect to be a little smaller, but still negative and significant. As shown in  \n\n![](images/de407243eca19fbcda3e6943057d02c19c40d77e340c41170280796e3cc71cb4.jpg)  \nFig. 7.

In columns (4) to (6), we estimate the same three models, but for a sample that included the areas that did not experience serfdom prior to 1733. The estimated coefficients are negative and significant at least at the $10\\%$ level. The same is true if we consider the regions that experienced vornedskab; see columns (7) to (8). The estimated coefficients imply reductions in wages from around $40\\%$ to $63\\%$ after serfdom in comparison to the control group.56 These results are all larger than our baseline results, which is in line with the idea that most occupations were affected by serfdom, suggesting again that the estimates based on using data for Denmark alone are conservative.  \n\n### 5.3. Discussion  \n\nAll the results presented above are consistent with the view that farmhands were negatively affected by the introduction of serfdom and, more generally, that monopsony power can reduce wages. In this section, we discuss interpretations as well as mechanisms. We noted that serfdom has in part been viewed as a response to an agricultural crisis with falling prices beginning after 1720. Yet, we note that wages of farmhands were not significantly statistically different from other groups in society in the period 1717-32, which marks the time that the abolition of vornedskab would have come into effect. We also note that there were no discernible pre-trends prior to1733.  \n\nOur results necessarily allow for several mechanisms as to why the wages of farmhands are relatively low. One mechanism is that farmhands could to a lesser extent exert their outside option by getting jobs at other estates, as compared to, e.g., craftsmen. The relatively stronger mobility of craftsmen may be attributed to the fact that they could more easily find jobs outside the village due to their education (Logstrup, 1988), or they might have had better options if they were to run away and migrate to another country (Olsen, 1933). Olsen (1933, p. 75) argued that the young craftsmen tied to an estate could easily find jobs abroad, and believed that they were relatively numerous among those that ran away. Another related mechanism is that the supply of apprentices coming to the cities from the rural areas would contract, as also suggested by Olsen (1933). If serfdom prevented young men from moving to other occupations, this would tend to weaken their outside options. This could also lead to a shortage of craftsmen in both cities and the rural sector, which would mean that the relative wages of farmhands would decrease. Finally, this also speaks to whether serfdom encouraged more able workers in the rural sector to select out of unskilled farm work, which could possibly explain the result on wages presented above.  \n\nTo obtain some suggestive evidence on this latter mechanism, we employ micro-level data for the city of Odense, for which information on the birthplaces of apprentices has been coded. These data include information on what type of guild the apprentice joined (e.g., for shoemakers and tailors), covering the years 1700 to 1790 and yielding a total of 516 observations.57 While we cannot employ a difference-in-differences approach in this setting, it is possible to test whether the probability the apprentice is recruited from the countryside declined from 1733. We do this by estimating the linear probability model  \n\n$$\nP(a p p r e n t i c e f r o m c o u n t r y s i d e=1\\mid x)=\\alpha_{g u i l d}+s e r f d o m_{1733}\\gamma+\\varepsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\nTable 9.

Here $\\alpha_{g u i l d}$ indicates guild fixed effects and $\\gamma$ indicates the effect of serfdom on the probability of recruiting from the country; serfdom $^{1733}$ is defined as above. Now $\\gamma<0$ would be consistent with this mechanism.  \n\nWe can also test whether the changes to serfdom mattered by allowing for separate coefficients for the four periods by estimating the model  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{P(a p p r e n t i c e f r o m c o u n t r y s i d e=1\\mid x)}\\ &{\\qquad=\\alpha_{g u i l d}+P e r i o d_{1}\\gamma_{1}+P e r i o d_{2}\\gamma_{2}+P e r i o d_{3}\\gamma_{3}+P e r i o d_{4}\\gamma_{4}+\\varepsilon_{i t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $P e r i o d_{1},\\ldots,P e r i o d_{4}$ are defined as above.  \n\nThe result of estimating these two equations is shown in Table 9. When we estimate the first model, we find that $\\hat{\\gamma}=-0.267$ , which is significant at the $1\\%$ level; see column (1) of Table 9. Although this could possibly indicate a general, negative trend for potential apprentices from the country unrelated to serfdom, we find that this is implausible, given our evidence on rural wages.  \n\nFor the second model, the coefficients are all negative and statistically significant; see column (2) of Table 9. Moreover, they are statistically different from each other. This suggests that changes to the affected age groups did matter for those who wanted to become apprentices. In particular, the tightening in 1742 seems to have made a difference, consistent with Holmgaard's (2003) argument that the reason for changing the age to nine years old was that the younger residents of the estate left before serfdom would apply to them. As a final test of this, we investigated whether we observe an effect when we only estimate on data from 1733, and then code the dummy as 1 from 1742. We find that there is a negative coefficient, which is statistically significant at the $10\\%$ level, suggesting that the observed pattern is associated with serfdom and not simply general trends. The tightening in 1764 does not seem to have changed much, however, and we find no detectable difference between the periods 1742-63 and 1764-90. This may (very plausibly) suggest that reducing the lower age from nine to four did not matter much for the supply of apprentices. This is in line with the available information from the 1787 census that we used to investigate the age distribution of apprentices. The average age of apprentices is 18.1 years in 1787. There is one apprentice of age seven and about $13\\%$ below 14. The census data, however, does not tell us the age at which the apprenticeship commenced. For the 1780s, we were able to combine the census data with the apprentice data from Odense, and found that the average age when the apprenticeship started was 15. Forty-six percent began before the age of 14, but again there was only one observation in which the apprentice started at age seven. These data are in line with the idea that the supply of apprentices was not strongly affected by reducing the lower age from nine to four.  \n\nIn contrast to what we typically find for the wage data, there are differential effects of tightening the rules. One reason we see effects with the apprentices could be that they are a small group, so any shock could be easier to discern.  \n\nIn sum, these results suggest that opportunities for becoming apprentices for young men from the countryside diminished after serfdom as well as the tightening of the rules. As mentioned, there are other plausible mechanisms, and while we do not know whether the effect on recruitment of apprentices from serfdom is more important than migration out of the country, its presence suggests that the mobility of farm labourers was, in fact, affected by serfdom.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nThis paper presents evidence that increased monopsony power can depress wages substantially through a case in which elites increased monopsony power by limiting the mobility of workers. We further address the tendency of revisionist historians to argue that serfdom had limited effects, due to the presence of runaways, as well as other ways of leaving estates. We thus offer new quantitative evidence on the impact of serfdom on labour markets by exploiting unique individuallevel data for eighteenth-century Denmark. We find a considerable negative effect on the wages of farmhands, consistent with the view that serfdom did matter for the mobility of workers and the labour market in general, and this is robust across a variety of specifications. This result is confirmed when we compare farmhand wages to the wages of unskilled Scanian workers. We also present evidence of a potential mechanism using data on apprenticeships, which suggests a decline in the number of apprentices coming from the countryside during periods of serfdom. This implies that restrictions on mobility can have considerable negative impacts on the labour market, might stymie human capital formation and thus ultimately have a deleterious effect on general development.  \n\nLundUniversity,Sweden   \nLinnaeusUniversity,Sweden   \nLundUniversity,Sweden   \nUniversity ofSouthernDenmark,Denmark   \nCopenhagenBusinessSchool,Denmark   \nUniversity of Southern Denmark, Denmark, CAGE, UK & CEPR, UK  \n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article:  \n\n## Online Appendix Replication Package  \n\n## References  \n\nAbildgren, K.

We investigate whether labor market power, as manifested by employer concentration and outside options, affect turnover rates. Utilizing online vacancy posting data, we find that moving from the 25th percentile to 75th percentile of employer concentration reduces the turnover rate by $5\\%$ driven by high-school workers in low-skill industries. The same exercise for outside options implies a $39\\%$ increase in the turnover rate, driven by workers in high-skill industries. JEL Classification: J63, J42, J23, E24 Keywords: labor market power, turnover rate, employer concentration, outside options  \n\n# 1 Introduction  \n\nOver the last two decades, the labor market has experienced a sustained decline in turnover rates, as documented by numerous studies (e.g., Hyatt and Spletzer, 2013; Molloy et al., 2016; Pries and Rogerson, 2022). Simultaneously, a noticeable rise in employer concentration has emerged, underscoring an augmentation of labor market power (e.g., Bahn, 2018; Shambaugn et al., 2018; Azar et al., 2020, 2022).  \n\nOur study delves into the potential contribution of labor market power to the observed downturn in labor market turnover. Drawing inspiration from the work of Lise and Postel-Vinay (2020) and Jarosch et al. (2021), we introduce a theoretical framework that uncovers a negative correlation between labor market power, quantified by employer concentration, and turnover rates. Meanwhile, we show that outside options, measured by the offer arival rate of other labor markets, act as catalysts for increasing turnover rates.  \n\nWe measure labor market turnover using the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) data, which aggregates hires, separations, and employment at the industry and commuting zone level. The turnover rate is defined as the sum of hires and separations divided by employment (Pries and Rogerson, 2022). We define local labor markets at the three-digitNAICS-industry-by-commuting-zone level. In alignment with our theoretical framework, we focus on empirically measuring two key aspects: employer concentration and outside options. Employer concentration is assessed using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of vacancy postings (Hershbein et al., 2022), while outside options are quantified by vacancy postings in \"nearby\" local labor markets, accounting for worker flows between industries. We leverage online vacancy postings data from the Burning Glass Technologies (BGT), which spans the years 2010 to 2019.1  \n\nTo address potential endogeneity issues stemming from common shocks affecting local labor markets, we adopt an instrumental variable approach, following the methodology outlined by Schubert et al. (2021). Specifically, we instrument employer concentration by interacting the nationwide leave-one-out vacancy growth rate of an employer with its predetermined share of vacancies in the local labor market. This instrumental variable predicts local vacancy postings and, consequently, employer concentration, while importantly remaining uncorrelated with local labor market shocks, under the assumption that employers leave-one-out nationwide vacancy postings are not influenced by local labor market turnover shocks. We instrument outside options using a shift-share instrumental variable, which interacts predetermined shares of vacancy postings with leave-one-out  \n\nvacancy postings by industry.  \n\nOur baseline results affirm our theoretical predictions: Employer concentration reduces turnover rates, while outside options increase them. Shifting from the 25th to the 75th percentile of employer concentration (outside options) decreases (increases) the turnover rateby $5\\%$ $(39\\%)$  \n\nWe further explore the data to uncover three results: First, employer concentration has a more significant impact on reducing the turnover rate among high-school-educated Workers, where the decline is a substantial $9\\%$ . Second, employer concentration decreases the turnover rate in low-skill industries, whereas outside options increase turnover rates in high-skill industries more, with industry skill requirements gauged using data from $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathrm{NET}$ (Guvenen et al., 2020; Lise and Postel-Vinay, 2020). Third, we observe no significant change in posted salaries.  \n\nThese findings align with the explanation that large employers in low-skill industries can exert greater labor market power, rather than a higher employer concentration leading to higher wages. As a result, we argue that increasing employer concentration could place high-school-educated workers in low-skill industries at a disadvantage.  \n\nOur study contributes to the understanding of the causal effects of employer concentration and outside options on turnover rates. While recent theoretical studies suggest a negative relationship between employer concentration and turnover rates (e.g., Bagga, 2023; Berger et al., 2022, in addition to the citations above), empirical estimates quantifying the extent of this relationship have been scarce.2 Our empirical results offer valuable insights for theoretical studies aiming to comprehend the aggregate impact of labor market power.  \n\nMoreover, this study contributes to the broader literature dedicated to understanding the decline in labor market dynamics (e.g., Decker et al., 2017; Pugsley and Sahin, 2019) in addition to the citations above). The empirical results of our study point to employer concentration as a key factor, while also highlighting the varied impacts that span across different levels of worker skills and industry-specific skillrequirements. These findings hold particular relevance for policymakers responsible for labor market regulation and oversight, suggesting that efforts to foster competition and curb excessive employer concentration in low-skill industries are vital for safeguarding the well-being of low-skill workers. By doing so, policymakers can mitigate the potential adverse consequences of concentrated labor market power and ensure fairer labor market outcomes for this vulnerable segment of the Workforce.  \n\nBy establishing a connection between employer concentration, turnover rates, and wages, this research aligns with a growing body of literature examining the impact of labor market power on wages (e.g., Lipsius, 2018; Marinescu et al., 2021; Lamadon et al., 2022; Rinz, 2022; Benmelech et al., 2022; Dodini et al., 2023, in addition to the citations above). We demonstrate that the decrease in turnover rates holds significance in understanding how labor market power influences wages, operating through the redistribution of match surplus rather than diminishing employment.  \n\nThe organization of the rest of the paper is as follows: Section 2 shows the theoretical framework. Section 3 describes the data and our empirical approach. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 discuss the effects on wages as well as the implication of minimum wages in the calibrated model. Section 6 concludes. Robustness analysis and model details are relegated to the Appendix.  \n\n# 2 Theoretical Framework  \n\nTo illustrate the link between labor market power, worker turnover, and wages, we propose a stylized theoretical framework. Our model is based on the framework by Lise and Postel-Vinay (2020), employing a granular search approach in which each sector features a finite number of firms. Time is continuous, and the model has a continuum of ex ante homogeneous workers. We initiate our analysis with a single sector with finite number of firms denoted by $j=1,...,M_{.}$ where firm boundaries are defined by their respective productivity levels, denoted as $z_{j}$ . Both firms and workers are assumed to be risk-neutral, with a subjective discount rate denoted by $\\rho$  \n\nUnemployed workers receive unemployment benefits $b$ , and they encounter firm $j$ With a probability of $\\lambda_{j}$ . Upon receiving an offer from a firm, the worker and the firm engage in sequential negotiations to determine the wage contract.  \n\nA distinctive feature of our model is that workers can renegotiate when presented with an outside offer. In this scenario, the current firm and the poaching firm engage in Bertrand competition to retain the worker. The arrival rate of offers from each firm is governed by $\\left\\{\\lambda_{j}\\right\\}_{j=1,\\dots,M}$ Notably, we assume that workers do not receive offers from their current employer, thus ensuring that a firm's vacancy share exerts a non-trivial influence on the offer arrival rate, especially in the presence of a finite number of firms.  \n\nIn addition to endogenous worker turnover through poaching and job-finding activities, the model incorporates exogenous turnover stemming from separations at a rate of 8.  \n\nThe match surplus at a firm with productivity $z$ is denoted as $S(z)$ . Bertrand competition dictates the allocation of surplus between the worker and the firm, with renegotiations occurring if the worker receives an outside offer. For instance, let's assume the initial wage contract is $W$ . If the worker is poached by another employer with productivity $z^{\\prime}$ , the worker will remain with the current employer if $S(z)\\geqslant S(z^{\\prime})$ and move to the poaching firm otherwise. In both cases, the worker receives a new wage contract denoted as $W^{\\prime}=\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{S(z),\\operatorname*{max}\\left\\{S(z^{\\prime}),W\\right\\}\\right\\}$ . Namely, the worker's new wage contract assumes a value equal to the joint surplus at the poaching firm if the worker chooses to stay or the joint surplus at the previous employer if the worker opts to leave.  \n\nWe denote the worker's share of surplus as $\\eta,$ given by:  \n\n$$\n\\eta=\\frac{S(z^{\\prime})-U}{S(z)-U}\n$$  \n\nHere, $U=b/\\rho$ represents the value of unemployment. Our model, in line with Lise and Postel-Vinay (2020), assumes that this share remains constant when the worker does not receive outside offers.  \n\nWhen a single sector is considered, the joint surplus satisfies the equation:  \n\n$$\n(\\rho+\\delta)S(z)=y(z)+\\delta U\n$$  \n\nThe surplus is discounted by the discount factor $\\rho$ and the probability of separation $\\delta$ when the left-over value becomes $\\delta U$ . The joint surplus is increasing in the flow output $y(z).$ , which, in turn, is increasing in firm-specific productivity $z$ . This implies that worker turnover occurs only when the productivity of a potential employer surpasses that of the current one.3  \n\nEmployer Concentration  We illustrate how employer concentration affects worker turnovers and wages in the model. To simplify analysis, we assume there are two firms With $z_{1}<z_{2}$  \n\nLet $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ denote the measure of employed workers at firms 1 and 2, respectively, where $g_{1}+g_{2}=1-u$ and $u$ represents the measure of unemployed workers. The offer arrival rates for firm 1 and firm 2 are denoted as $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2},$ respectively, with $\\sigma_{2}\\equiv\\lambda_{2}/(\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2})$ representing the vacancy share of firm 2. We define the overall offer-arrival rate as $\\lambda\\equiv\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2},$ which we assume to be fixed. The measure of labor market power is quantified through the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of offer arrival rates, as given by:  \n\n$$\nE C=\\sigma_{1}^{2}+\\sigma_{2}^{2}=(1-\\sigma_{2})^{2}+\\sigma_{2}^{2}\n$$  \n\nWe refer to Equation (3) as employer concentration, which measures the dispersion of offers while keeping the total offer arrival rate fixed. In this simple example, employer concentration is minimized when $\\sigma_{2}=0.5\\$ indicating an equal probability of workers encountering each firm and resulting in an employer concentration of 0.5.  \n\nThe turnover rate in the model is:  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{{m}}}=\\lambda u+\\delta(1-u)+\\lambda\\sigma_{2}g_{1}\n$$  \n\nThis equation accounts for job-finding among unemployed workers, exogenous separations among employed workers, and on-the-job switching from firm 1 to firm 2. In the steady state, the first two terms on the right-hand add to a constant because we assume the job-finding rate $\\lambda$ is constant. Therefore, we concentrate on the third term and rewrite the turnover rate as:  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{m}}=\\lambda\\sigma_{2}g_{1}\n$$  \n\nThis simplified expression underscores the dependence of the turnover rate on the vacancy share of firm 2 and the measure of workers in firm 1. While a higher vacancy share of firm 2 tends to increase the turnover rate by allowing workers in firm 1 to switch to firm 2, it's essential to recognize that this effect may be counteracted by a reduction in the measure of workers in firm 1. The rationale is that when a substantial portion of workers is employed in firm 2, and they do not receive offers from their current firm, the turnover rate can decline due to the lack of on-the-job switching.  \n\nAppendix Section B provides the full expression for the turnover rate as:  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{{m}}}=\\frac{(\\sigma_{2}-\\sigma_{2}^{2})\\delta}{(1+\\delta/\\lambda)(\\sigma_{2}+\\delta/\\lambda)}\n$$  \n\nWeset $\\delta=0.028$ and $\\lambda=0.4$ to align with the separation rate and job-finding rate in the data. We then vary $\\sigma_{2}$ from 0.5 to 1, tracing out the turnover rate and employer concentration. This exercise aims to elucidate the relationship between employer concentration and the turnover rate, commencing from a uniformly distributed labor market.  \n\nFigure 1 (a) demonstrates a negative correlation between turnover rates and employer concentration. An increase in the proportion of vacancies from firm 2 raises the offer arrival rate, but this is balanced by a decrease in firm 1's workforce. As a result, a rise in employer concentration is associated with a reduction in turnover rates. In the extreme case where firm 2 provides all job offers, there is a complete absence of on-the-job search, leading to minimal turnover.  \n\nConcerning average wages, the relationship is less straightforward. Figure 1 (b) indicates a non-linear relationship between employer concentration and average wages.4 This suggests that a rise in employment at more productive firms does not uniformly translate to increased wages. With higher employer concentration, more workers are employed by the more productive firm 2, allowing more room for possible wage increases. However, this is offset by a decline in competing job offers from firm 1, which limits workers' ability to negotiate higher wages. In the extreme, when firm 2 is the sole job provider, workers are confined to unemployment benefits, as firm 2 has no willingness to share the match surplus with them.  \n\nThis analysis highlights a complex interplay between employer concentration and wages. Although larger firms typically offer higher wages (e.g., Song et al., 2019), studies show that in contexts of high employer concentration, wages are often lower (e.g., Schubert et al., 2021; Azar et al., 2020). In such markets, large firms, akin to the high-productivity firm 2, pay more on average when concentration is moderate. Yet, extremely high concentration can lead to reduced wages due to larger surplus extraction by firms.  \n\nThe influence of employer concentration is also dependent on the model parameters, namely the job-finding and separation rates. Lower rates in either reduce the impact of employer concentration. This is because workers with fewer job offers or lower separation rates are more likely to remain with their current employer, diminishing the relevance of the distribution of external job offers.5  \n\nOutside Option  We extend the example to have two sectors to study the impact of outside options on the turnover rate. For simplicity, we assume that the new sector has one firm, and workers in sector 1 accepts offers from the new sector (sector 2) with probability $\\pi$ The offer arrival rate from sector 2 is $\\gamma$ , which we interpret as an outside option.  \n\nIn this setup, the turnover rate in sector 1 is expressed as:  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{{m}}}=(\\lambda+\\pi\\gamma)u+\\delta(1-u)+(\\lambda+\\pi\\gamma)\\sigma_{2}g_{1}+\\pi\\gamma g_{2}\n$$  \n\nEquation (6) reveals an unambiguous relationship between the outside option and the turnover rate. Specifically, an increase in the offer arrival rate implies that more workers in sector 1 would opt to switch to sector 2, all else being equal. In our empirical analysis, we normalize the turnover rate by employment, thereby taking into account potential employment declines resulting from reallocations across sectors.  \n\nIt's important to note that the distinction between employer concentration and outside options hinges on the definition of a \"local\" labor market. In our model, a local labor market corresponds to a sector, and employer concentration measures the dispersion of job offers within sectors. Conversely, outside options pertain to turnover across local markets. Our choice of a local labor market is elaborated upon in Section 3.  \n\n# 3  Data and Empirical Methods  \n\nMotivated by the theoretical framework, we examine the effects of employer concentration and outside options on the turnover rate. We elaborate on our measurement and empirical methodologies in this section.  \n\n## 3.1  Local Labor Markets  \n\nOur first task is to define the empirical counterpart of a local labor market. We choose a local labor market to be a three-digit-NAICS-industry-by-commuting-zone cell, which reflects several considerations.  \n\nThe discussion of labor market power often explicitly or implicit separates labor market at the industry or occupation level (e.g., Hershbein et al., 2022; Rossi-Hansberg et al. 2020). Our choice to focus on the industry level arises primarily from data constraints, as our dataset exclusively records turnover across industries. At this juncture, we focus on three-digit NAICS industries, striking a balance between capturing the effects of employer concentration and the relevance of outside options. Broader categorizations, such as two-digit NAICS industries, encompass many firms within a local labor market, potentially diminishing the impact of outside options, because turnover rates across such broad categories tend to be lower.  \n\nOn the other hand, adopting a more granular level, such as four-digit NAICS industries, could artificially amplify the influence of outside options while constraining the effects of employer concentration. This limitation stems from the fact that there are fewer firms at this level, resulting in reduced variation in employer concentration within these narrowly defined industries. Moreover, certain four-digit NAICS industries may exhibit substantial overlap in the pool of desired workers, challenging the notion of distinct \"local\" labor markets (e.g., 3362 Motor vehicle body and trailer manufacturing and 3363 Motor vehicle parts manufacturing). Therefore, we use three-digit-NAICS industry as the baseline definition of local labor markets, while also conducting robustness checks with different aggregation levels.6  \n\nGeographically, commuting-zone-level analysis integrates the concept that job seekers primarily explore employment opportunities within reasonable commuting distances. This notion aligns with empirical observations suggesting that individuals tend to search for job openings within approximately 10 miles of their residences (e.g., Manning and Petrongolo) 2017; Marinescu and Rathelot, 2018). We include robustness analysis with county and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level results in Section 4.3.  \n\nThe definition of local labor markets, as described, implies that employer concentration pertains to the distribution of job offers within each three-digit-NAICS-industry-bycommuting-zone cell, while outside would correspond to job offers in other local markets, namely another industry in the same commuting zone, the same industry in another commuting zone, or both. This definition effectively captures the idea that workers primarily focus their job searches within their local markets, e.g., a three-digit-NAICS-industry-bycommuting-zone cell, with transitions across these markets incurring substantial costs. Throughout the subsequent sections, we will use terms such as \"industry-by-CZ local markets\" or simply \"local markets\" interchangeably to denote these units, unless confusion arises.  \n\n## 3.2 Labor Market Turnover  \n\nWe construct the turnover rate using Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) sourced from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) database. The LEHD uses quarterly state unemployment insurance (UI) records to identify worker-firm employment spells, which implies that our measure applies only to formal employment.  \n\nOur dataset encompasses all US states and spans from 2010 to 2019, aligning with the timeframe of our vacancy postings data and covering workers aged 19 to 54.7  \n\nThe QWI is quarterly data which identifies new hires as worker-firm pairs that show earnings to state UI agencies in one quarter, but do not show such earnings in the preceding quarter. Similarly, separations are worker-firm pairs that show earnings in one quarter, but show no such earnings in the next quarter. Therefore, new hires include job seekers who leave unemployment, as well as reallocation across firms. Similarly, separations could mean that workers join another firm, or enter unemployment.  \n\nWe define the turnover rate as the sum of new hires $H_{t}$ and separations $S_{t}$ over total  \n\nemployment $E_{t}$  \n\n$$\nm_{t}=\\frac{H_{t}+S_{t}}{E_{t}}\n$$  \n\nThis definition is the empirical counterpart of the turnover rate in Section 2, which has also been used in other studies on the turnover rate, e.g., Engbom (2018) and Pries and Rogerson (2022). We calculate annual averages of the turnover rate to ensure consistency With our measure of employer concentration.  \n\nThe turnover rate for a given local labor market is denoted as $m_{i,c,t},$ With $i$ and $c$ indexing industry and commuting zone, respectively. As in our theoretical framework, this turnover rate encapsulates worker flows both within local labor markets and across them.  \n\n## 3.3 Employer Concentration  \n\nWe follow a strand of literature and use online vacancy postings data to measure employer concentration (Hershbein and Kahn, 2018; Azar et al., 2022). Our theoretical framework establishes the link between vacancy concentration and the turnover rate, because the former indicates the extent to which job opportunities come from the same employers.  \n\nSpecifically, we use the Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) data which contains the near-universe of online vacancy postings in the US. Let $v_{j,i,c,t}$ be the total number of vacancy postings for employer $j$ in industry $i$ and commuting zone $c$ at time $t$ .For each three-digit-NAICS-industry-by-commuting-zone local market, we construct a HHI of vacancy concentration following the theoretical exercise (Equation 3):  \n\n$$\nH H I_{i,c,t}=\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j,i,c,t}^{2}\n$$  \n\nwhere the share of vacancy postings by employer $j,\\sigma_{j,i,c,t},$ is defined as  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{j,i,c,t}=\\frac{v_{j,i,c,t}}{\\sum_{j}v_{j,i,c,t}}\n$$  \n\nWe set the frequency of data to be annual for reasons that we explain in detail later in the section.  \n\n## 3.4 Outside Options  \n\nOur calculation of workers' outside options involves vacancy postings from other local labor markets, akin to the offer arrival rate within our theoretical framework. We represent this outside option as the weighted sum of vacancy postings in other local markets, with  \n\nthe weights determined by the rate of worker flows between industries:  \n\n$$\nO O_{i,c,t}=\\sum_{k\\neq i}\\pi_{i k}v_{k,c,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\pi_{i k}$ is the rate of worker flows between industry $i$ and $k$ . The worker flows embed the notion of \"distance\" between local markets, which is the empirical equivalence of the switching probability in our theoretical framework (Equation 6).  \n\nWe constructed worker flows between industries using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) covering the years 2010 to 2019. The CPS categorizes industries using fourdigit Census industry codes. We employed a crosswalk provided by the US Census Bureau to convert these codes into corresponding three-digit NAICS industries, achieving a match for $86\\%$ (84/98) of these industries.8 A switch from industry $i$ to $k$ is identified when a Worker changes from one three-digit NAICS industry to another between two consecutive months. Worker flows were aggregated using the CPS final weight, and the outflows from each industry were normalized to sum to one, yielding a set of switching probabilities $\\{\\pi_{i k}\\}$ 9。  \n\nTable 1 shows that defining local markets by industry or occupation gives similar HHIs, which is consistent with the evidence in Dodini et al. (2023). Approximately half of the markets exhibit HHIs exceeding 2500, a threshold designating \"highly concentrated\" markets according to the DOJ /FTC guidelines. However, outside options demonstrate significant variation among local markets, with the median market possessing 84 weighted vacancies from other local markets annually, and the 99th percentile reaching 8722. This pronounced skewness underscores the inequality in switching opportunities across local labormarkets.  \n\n## 3.5 Empirical Methods  \n\nFollowing Equation (6), our empirical framework is  \n\n$$\ny_{i,c,t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1}\\log{(H H I_{i,c,t})}+\\beta_{2}\\log{(O O_{i,c,t})}+\\gamma_{i t}+\\eta_{c t}+\\lambda_{i c}+\\Omega X_{i,c,t}+\\epsilon_{i,c,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\gamma_{i t}$ are industry-by-year fixed effects, $\\eta_{k t}$ are commuting-zone-by-year fixed effects, $\\lambda_{i c}$ are industry-by-commuting-zone fixed effects, and $X_{i,c,t}$ are time-varying controls at the industry-by-CZ level, to be discussed below.  \n\nThe presence of common shocks to both the turnover rate and employer concentration could introduce bias to the estimates. For example, if a new restaurant enters a local labor market, there will be an increase in hiring, and, therefore, turnovers, but a decrease in employer concentration.  \n\nThe outside option index is also subject to the bias of common shocks. Suppose there is a negative shock to industry $i$ which leads to worker outflows to other industries. If such outflows induce firms in nearby industries to post more vacancies, the negative shock would be correlated with both the turnover rate and outside option index.  \n\nTo mitigate potential biases originating from common shocks, we employ instrumental variables. These instruments utilize leave-one-out nationwide changes in firms' vacancy postings. Additionally, we adopt shift-share instrumental variables to account for the influence of common shocks on outside options.  \n\n### 3.6  The Employer Concentration Instrumental Variable  \n\nOur instrumental variable for employer concentration follows Schubert et al. (2021). Specifically, we write changes in the HHI as:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\Delta H H I_{i,c,t}=\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j,i,c,t}^{2}-\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j,i,c,t-1}^{2}}\\ {\\displaystyle=\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j,i,c,t-1}^{2}\\left(\\frac{(1+g_{j,i,c,t})^{2}}{(1+g_{i,c,t})^{2}}-1\\right)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNamely, the increase in local employer concentration depends on the initial vacancy share $\\sigma_{j,i,c,t-1}$ and the growth rate of vacancies of one employer $g_{j,i,c,t}$ relative to the average vacancy growth rate of the local labor market $g_{i,c,t}$  \n\nWe create an instrument for $g_{j,i,c,t}$ by leveraging nationwide changes in vacancies while excluding vacancies in the local market of origin. Specifically, we utilize the growth rate of leave-one-out nationwide vacancies, denoted as $\\tilde{g}_{j,i,c,t},$ to predict the employer's vacancy postings in the local labor market when the employer operates in multiple markets.10 For example, if Walmart has a large share of vacancies in Retail Trade industry in a commuting zone in Arkansas, and if it increases vacancy postings in Retail Trade industry in other parts of the US, it is likely that Walmart's vacancies in Retail Trade industry in the Arkansas commuting zone would also increase, leading to an increase in employer concentration. The instrumental variable $\\tilde{g}_{j,i,c,t}$ satisfies the exclusion restriction, assuming that firms decisions regarding vacancy postings in other markets are not influenced by shocks specific to the originating labor market. In other words, we would like a nationwide shock to Walmart to trigger changes in employer concentration in Retail Trade industry in a commuting zone in Arkansas, instead of a shock to the local market to affect the nationwide operation of Walmart.  \n\nConcretely, the instrumental variable for employer concentration is  \n\n$$\nH H I_{i,c,t}^{I V}=\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j,i,c,t-1}^{2}\\left(\\frac{(1+\\tilde{g}_{j,i,c,t})^{2}}{(1+\\tilde{g}_{i,c,t})^{2}}-1\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{r}{\\tilde{g}_{i,c,t}=\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j,i,c,t-1}\\tilde{g}_{j,i,c,t}}\\end{array}$ is the predicted local vacancy growth rate. Equation (13) uses plausibly exogenous \"shocks\" to local vacancy growth and endogenous \"shares\" of previous-period local labor market vacancies of each employer. As Borusyak et al. (2022) suggests, we account for potential bias in cases where exposure \"shares\" do not sum to one by using $\\begin{array}{r}{\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j,i,c,t}^{2}\\mathbb{I}\\big[\\tilde{g}_{j,i,c,t}\\neq0\\big]}\\end{array}$  \n\nIn adherence to our theoretical framework, which assumes a constant job-finding rate, we control for the predicted growth rate of total vacancy postings, denoted as $\\tilde{g}_{i,c,t},$ in each local labor market in our empirical analysis. This measure additionally accounts for labor demand shocks in local markets. Consequently, our coefficient $\\beta_{1}$ is designed to isolate the effects of employer concentration, rather than conflating these with the impact of total vacancy postings.11 We note that time-varying labor demand shocks at the commuting zone or industry level are effectively absorbed by the fixed effects.  \n\nA potential concern relates to the influence of time-varying worker \"quality\" in each local market, which could bias our estimates. For instance, college-educated workers typically exhibit lower turnover rates, as shown in Table A.10. If the increase in vacancies aligns with a growing demand for college-educated workers, our estimates might reflect these workers' lower turnover rates rather than the direct impact of employer concentration.  \n\nTo address possible omitted variable bias, we employ two sets of variables: local market time trends and local controls, which include lagged proportions of college-educated Workers and vacancies requiring a college degree. The two sets of variables are sequentially incorporated in our robustness analysis.12  \n\nThe choice of the length of a period becomes relevant because we need two periods of data to construct the instrumental variable. The decision to use annual data frequency is justified for two reasons: firstly, the substantial quarterly volatility in vacancies for most employers, often due to seasonal hiring patterns, may not accurately reflect changes in employer concentration; secondly, our instrumental variable approach focuses on vacancy growth rates for large employers. Annual data helps to exclude smaller employers with inconsistent vacancy posting patterns, thus concentrating on firms with more stable hiring activities.13  \n\nFurthermore, the annual data frequency aligns more closely with our theoretical framework, which is set in a steady-state context. It is plausible that initial vacancy increases at large firms might temporarily boost worker turnover before eventually displacing smaller firms′ vacancies.14 Annual frequency allows for a longer adjustment period in local markets compared to quarterly data.  \n\n### 3.7  The Outside Option Instrumental Variable  \n\nWe instrument for the outside option index by utilizing the interaction between predetermined vacancy shares and leave-one-out nationwide vacancies at the industry level. The instrumental variable is represented as:  \n\n$$\nO O_{i,c,t}^{I V}=\\sum_{k\\neq i}\\pi_{i k}\\frac{v_{k,c,2007}}{v_{k,2007}}v_{k,\\&,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $v_{k,c,2007}/v_{k,2007}$ is the vacancy share for commuting zone $c$ in 2007, which is the first year with available BGT data. $v_{k,\\updelta,t}$ is the total vacancy postings in industry $k$ at time $t_{.}$ leaving out commuting zone $c$  \n\nEquation (14) is a standard shift-share instrumental variable. For example, Beaudry et al. (2012) employ an instrumental variable similar to ours. The instrumental variable satisfies the exclusion restriction if initial vacancy shares and leave-one-out industry averages of the outcome variable are not subject to shocks to the origination market. This only needs to hold after controlling for fixed effects. For example, industry-by-year fixed effects would capture nationwide shocks to the turnover rate in industry $i,$ and, therefore, the instrumental variable remains valid if it is not correlated with shocks specific to the origination market. We employ the initial vacancy shares from 2007, as the validity of shift-share instruments hinges on the exogeneity of these shares (Goldsmith-Pinkham et al., 2020). We evaluate the extent to which the instrumental variable for outside options is exogenous in Appendix Section A.1.  \n\n### 3.8 Validating the Instrumental Variables  \n\n#### 3.8.1  Summary Statistics  \n\nTable 2 shows the summary statistics of the instrumental variables, which normalize the employer concentration IV to be from 0 to 10000.15 Notably, the instrumental variable for employer concentration exhibits a distribution that is less skewed compared to employer concentration itself. Conversely, the instrumental variable for the outside option index displays a distribution similar to its original counterpart.  \n\nWe also compare geographic distributions of the HHI and its IV, which sheds light on whether employer concentration display some patterns geographically, because such patterns imply that employer concentration could be correlated with area-specific confounds. Figure 2 shows that the Midwest and Southwest regions tend to have high employer concentrations. On the other hand, the HHI IV is more evenly distributed, except for a few markets with very high values. This implies that the variation relies on the changes in the HHI IV, rather than its differences across space, which lends strength to our empirical strategy.  \n\n#### 3.8.2  Measurement and Endogeneity  \n\nThe literature that tries to identify the causal effects of employer concentration either uses firm mergers to study special cases (Arnold, 2020; Prager and Schmitt, 2019), or adopts instrumental variable strategies which we base our analysis on.  \n\nWe prefer the latter approach for two reasons: First, it is more suitable for the purpose of the current study, which tries to understand the heterogeneous effects of employer concentration and outside options on the turnover rate. Restricting the attention to specific mergers would not allow us to compare the effects on, e.g., high-skill versus low-skill industries. Second, we argue that our instrumental variables are less subject to the main drawback of using online vacancy postings, namely that it is not representative of small firms' labor demand, because it mainly uses variations from large employers.  \n\nAppendix Section A.1 discusses the identification assumptions in more detail, which suggests that the main concern is the potential link between firms' nationwide vacancy growth and local shocks. If a local shock drives firms' leave-one-out nationwide vacancy postings, the instrumental variable for employer concentration would not satisfy the exclusion restriction. This is particularly likely for moderately sized employers. For example, an employer who operates in only two commuting zones is very likely to increase its leave-one-out vacancy postings if either commuting zone receives a positive demand shock. In this case, a local shock to one commuting zone would spill over to affect the vacancy postings in another one, which would invalidate the instrumental variable.  \n\nOn the other hand, the concern is alleviated if local shocks are unlikely to drive firms' leave-one-out nationwide vacancy growth. In other words, our instrumental variable Would be valid if a shock to, e.g., Walmart drives local employer concentration, but would be otherwise invalid if a local shock drives the leave-one-out nationwide vacancy postings of Walmart. The former scenario is arguably the case for large employers who operate in multiple markets. And then, the instrumental variable for employer concentration resembles a standard shift-share instrumental variable of, e.g., state-level endogenous variables. A shock to one state is arguably unlikely to spill over to all other states. Similarly, a local shock to, e.g., General Merchandise Stores industry in a commuting zone in Arkansas is arguably unlikely to affect vacancy postings in all other local markets of Walmart, which post over 40,000 vacancies annually.  \n\nWe show in Appendix Section A.6 that the variation in the instrumental variables relies heavily on firms whose total vacancy postings are above the 99th percentile, and we argue that this is ideal for our purpose because: 1) these large employers are more likely to use online platforms for recruiting extensively; and 2) large employer's nationwide vacancies are less likely to be affected by shocks to a single three-digit-NAICS-industry-bycommuting-zone market.  \n\nWe follow Borusyak et al. (2022) to show further evidence that the instrumental variable for employer concentration might not be correlated with local shocks by examining the correlation between the instrumental variable and various local economic variables, which include the lag of employment-to-population ratio, lag of log posted salary, and lag of fraction of college workers. Appendix Section A.1 shows little evidence of significant correlation.16 In addition, we note that local shocks at the commuting zone level are absorbed by commuting-zone-by-time fixed effects, such as log GDP, income taxes, minimum wages, etc. Therefore, our instrumental variable for employer concentration could arguably satisfy the exclusion restriction in our context.  \n\nSection 4.1 provides three alternative instrument variables. First, we focus only on large employers who operate in at least three local markets and use online vacancy postings extensively. Second, for each employer, we exclude its local market with the most vacancy postings. Third, we split the sample of local markets evenly into two sub-samples and define two instrument variables for the HHI, which allows us to conduct tests of over-identifying restrictions. A unifying aspect of these alternative instrumental variables is establishing robustness when firms' nation-wide vacancy postings are less likely to be affected by single markets.  \n\nOn the other hand, this means that our identification strategy is unlikely to capture the effects of small changes in employer concentration in unconcentrated markets. However, to the extent that the instrumental variables allow us to estimate the heterogeneous effects of employer concentration, we argue that the analysis offers new insight to the literature.  \n\n# 4 Empirical Results  \n\nWe discuss the effects on the turnover rate. And then, we show how the effects change with education and the skill content of industries. We leave details of the robustness analysis to Appendix Section A.  \n\n## 4.1 The Effects on the Turnover Rate  \n\nTable 3 Column (1) shows the results from the OLS regression. It suggests a negative correlation between employer concentration and the turnover rate. Column (1) also demonstrates a positive cross-sectional correlation between outside options and the turnover rate. However, the estimates may capture the effects of common shocks.  \n\nColumn (2) presents the results of the two-stage-least-square (2SLS) regression utilizing instrumental variables. It indicates that the effect of employer concentration is larger in magnitude than that in the OLS regression. Moving from the 25th percentile (corresponding to an unconcentrated local market) to the 75th percentile of employer concentration (corresponding to a highly concentrated local market) results in a $5\\%$ decrease in the turnover rate.17 The point estimate for outside options is larger and positive, aligning with our theoretical expectations. A transition from the 25th to the 75th percentile of outside options corresponds to a substantial $39\\%$ increase in the turnover rate.18  \n\nThe negative response of the turnover rate to employer concentration could be linked to reduced job-switching opportunities. Specifically, increased employer concentration might restrict workers to remain with their employers, leading to lower wages since job-switchers typically experience wage gains (e.g., Bartel and Borjas, 1981; Altonji and Williams, 1992; Topel and Ward, 1992; Kambourov and Manovski, 2009).  \n\nThe magnitude of the positive effect of outside options is notably larger, signifying that workers respond to opportunities outside their local labor markets despite potential switching costs. This heightened effect could be because an increase in vacancy postings in nearby local markets impacts the job-switching prospects of all workers in the focal market. Conversely, the effects of employer concentration are more nuanced, contingent on whether the local market is already concentrated.  \n\nIncorporating local market time trends or local controls does not significantly alter the estimates, as evidenced by the similarity in results between Columns (3) and (4) compared to those in Column (2). Consequently, it is unlikely that changes in worker composition are driving the results.  \n\nAlternative Instrumental Variables As discussed in Section 3.8.2, the validity of the instrumental variable for employer concentration is predicated on the assumption that nationwide vacancy growths of firms drive local vacancy postings, rather than the reverse. To bolster the credibility of our findings, we explore three alternative methods for constructing the instrumental variable for the HHI.  \n\nFirst, we narrow our focus to employers operating in at least three local markets and posting a minimum of 100 vacancies from 2010 to 2019. This criterion serves to exclude smaller employers who may not extensively use online platforms for recruitment, thereby aligning with the premise that large employers are less influenced by individual local markets. We then utilize these larger employers to construct our instrumental variable (Equation 13).  \n\nSecondly, we build on the first condition by excluding the most important local market for each employer when constructing the instrumental variable. This is achieved by aggregating vacancy postings at the employer-industry-commuting-zone level over our entire sample period and identifying each employer's core local market-defined as the market with the highest number of postings.19 In calculating the nationwide vacancy growth for firms, we disregard postings from these core markets and exclude each firm's data in its core market when constructing the instrumental variable.2o This approach, while not completely eliminating \"spillover\" from core markets, ensures that the instrumental variable is less influenced by firms' most pivotal local markets. Essentially, it leverages firms' smaller markets, which are less likely to impact their postings in other markets.  \n\nThird, we divide the local markets into two equal sub-samples and create two separate instrumental variables for the HHI, each based on one half of the markets. We then employ the Hansen J statistic for over-identifying restrictions to test if the instrumental variables are appropriately independent of the error process, indicative of large employers not being overly influenced by individual localities.  \n\nSpecifically, our instrumental variables for employer concentration are:  \n\n$$\n\\protect\\begin{array}{c c}{\\displaystyle{V,1}}\\ {\\displaystyle{c,t}}\\end{array}=\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j,i,c,t-1}^{2}\\left(\\frac{(1+\\tilde{g}_{j,i,c,t}^{1})^{2}}{(1+\\tilde{g}_{i,c,t}^{1})^{2}}-1\\right),\\quad,H H I_{i,c,t}^{I V,2}=\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{j,i,c,t-1}^{2}\\left(\\frac{(1+\\tilde{g}_{j,i,c,t}^{2})^{2}}{(1+\\tilde{g}_{i,c,t}^{2})^{2}}-1\\right).\n$$  \n\nwheregj,i,c,t is the leave-one-out sub-sample-wide vacancy growth for firm $j$ in the first half of the local markets.2 The alculation fo g,.e. f follows a similar process.22 We incorporate both intrumental variables in our 2SLS regression and repeat the analysis 100 times with randomly divided samples, and we present the distribution of the Hansen J statistics.  \n\nTable 4 shows these results, with Column (3) showing the median estimates for the HHI and outside options when the sample is split. These alternative instrumental variables yield coefficients similar to those in the baseline results (Table 3 Column 2). Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of Hansen J statistics, with $93\\%$ of the instances not rejecting the hypothesis that the instrumental variables are independent of the error process. This robustness analysis lends further credibility to our identification strategy.  \n\nHeterogeneity  We estimate the effects separately for college-educated and high-schooleducated workers. The regression include workers of all ages because the QWI does not aggregate by age and education. Therefore, the estimates are not comparable to that in Table 3 Column (2) which applies to younger workers whose turnover rates are more sensitive (e.g., Liu, 2022a).  \n\nWe separately calculate the HHI and outside options for college-educated and highschool-educated workers.23 Table A.10 shows the distribution of HHI, outside options, and turnover rates segmented by educational level. We observe that the HHIs for both high-school and college-educated workers are comparably similar. The summary statistics indicate a decrease in the turnover rate with the inclusion of older workers in the sample.  \n\nColumns (5) and (6) show the results for high-school workers and college workers, respectively, which suggests that the effects of employer concentration are approximately $98\\%$ stronger for high-school-educated workers than for college-educated workers. These estimates imply that transitioning from the 25th to the 75th percentile of employer concentration decreases the turnover rate of high-school-educated workers by $9\\%$ .24This suggests that heterogeneous responses by workers' educational attainment could be important for understanding the negative effects on the turnover rate.  \n\nNext, we compare the effects based on the skill content of industries, shedding further light on which sectors see the most negative effects of employer concentration on the turnover rate.  We construct a skill index for each industry using $\\mathrm{O^{*}N E T}$ data (e.g.; Guvenen et al., 2020), where we calculate the skill requirements of each occupation along three dimensions: cognitive, manual, and inter-personal skills. We aggregate the skill requirements of each occupation to the industry level by calculating the occupation vacancy shares of each industry and then weighting each skill by its productivity in Lise and Postel-Vinay (2020).25  \n\nIndustries with the highest skill indices include Space Research, Lessors of Nonfinancial Intangible Assets, and Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing, while those with the lowest skill indices comprise Personal and Laundry Services, Couriers and Messengers, and Accommodation.26  \n\nWe divide industries evenly into three groups based on their skill index: high-skill, medium-skill, and low-skill industries. For each group, we estimate the effects of employer concentration and outside options on the turnover rate of workers aged 19 to 54. We use the HHI, outside options, and turnover rate by industry skills in Table A.11 when interpreting the coefficients.  \n\nColumns (7) to (9) of Table 3 present the results, revealing two key patterns. First, the negative effect of employer concentration is more pronounced in low-skill industries, indicating that transitioning from the 25th to the 75th percentile of employer concentration leads to a $7\\%$ reduction in the turnover rate.27 On the other hand, the turnover rate in high-skill industries does not respond to changes in employer concentration, as the point estimate is small and statistically insignificant. The comparison is consistent with the employers exercising greater labor market power in low-skill industries by reducing competing vacancies and turnover opportunities. However, large employers in low-skill industries may retain workers by offering higher wages, which we examine in Section 4.2.  \n\nSecond, the effect of outside options is more substantial in high-skill industries. The large point estimate in Column (7) suggests that a transition from the 25th to the 75th percentile of outside options results in a $69\\%$ increase in the turnover rate in high-skill industries.28 This could be attributed to the fact that firms in high-skill industries share similar skill requirements, as evidenced by the data. For example, the top three high-skill industries have similar skill intensity in cognitive skills. Moreover, the occupational composition of high-skill industries may overlap. For example, a software engineer who switches from Google (tech service) to Amazon (retail trade) would contribute to an increase in turnover induced by outside options.  \n\nIn contrast, the response of the turnover rate to increased outside options is notably smaller in low-skill industries. Specifically, a shift from the 25th to the 75th percentile of outside options results in only a $27\\%$ increase in the turnover rate, a figure that is less than half the impact observed in high-skill industries.29 An explanation is that workers in low-skill industries may switch markets for reasons not directly related to outside options, suggesting that their market-switching decisions could be less influenced by demand factors.30  \n\nAnother factor to consider is the potential bias of BGT vacancies towards high-skill jobs. Consequently, an increase in outside options reflected in online vacancies may not be as relevant for some workers in low-skill industries.31  \n\nIn medium-skill industries, there is no significant response to changes in either employer concentration or outside options, although the direction of the point estimates aligns with those observed in the baseline analysis. Similar to low-skill industries, this lack of significant response in medium-skill industries may be partly attributed to the less precise measurement of outside options for these industries. Additionally, it is plausible that workers in medium-skill sectors tend to transition either to higher or lower-skilled industries, a phenomenon consistent with the findings in Groes et al. (2015).  \n\nWhen examining the combined effects of employer concentration and outside options, our analysis indicates that high-school-educated workers and those in low-skill industries may be more vulnerable to the rising power of employers in the labor market. Because of the importance of low-skill and high-skill industries for understanding the effects of employer concentration and outside options, we focus on the two industry groups to further interpret the results.  \n\n## 4.2  Analysis on the Low- and High-Skill Industry Groups  \n\n### 4.2.1  Low-Skill Industries  \n\nIn low-skill industries, we observe a substantial decrease in the turnover rate due to employer concentration. This effect is particularly pronounced and could be attributed to the prevalence of high-school-educated workers in these sectors. These workers exhibit greater sensitivity to employer concentration, thereby resulting in a more substantial impact on turnover rates. To further dissect these findings, we stratify the turnover rates in low-skill industries based on the education level of workers, as this is the only available  \n\nmeasure of skills in the QWI data.  \n\nConcretely, we estimate the effects of employer concentration on both high-school and college-educated workers within low-skill industries.32 The results, presented in Panel A of Table 5, highlight the substantial effects of employer concentration within these industries. Columns (1) and (2) reveal that the effects of employer concentration in low-skill industries are more significant than those in all industries (Table 3 Columns 5 and 6). College-educated workers in low-skill industries experience a $48\\%$ more reduction in turnover rates compared to their counterparts in other industries. High-school-educated workers in these sectors still exhibit a more substantial decline in turnover rates than college-educated workers.  \n\nFurthermore, the impact of outside options in low-skill industries is only significant for college-educated workers. For high-school workers, while the point estimate remain similar to that in Table 3 Column (9), the decline in precision, possibly because of the smaller sample size, renders the efect insignificant. These findings highlight the importance of interacting education with industry skill contents. Specifically, high-school-educated workers in low-skill industries could suffer the most from an increase in employer concentration, while they receive limited benefits from more outside options, possibly due to factors such as switching costs, limited wage differentials, or mismatch with online job openings.  \n\nGiven the theoretical framework linking labor market power to wages, we explore the effects of employer concentration and outside options on posted salaries in low-skill industries. The BGT data contains salary information for a subset of vacancy postings, which measures firms' willingness to share match surplus with workers before any bargaining takes place. Panel A, Columns (3) and (4) of Table 5, demonstrate that neither employer concentration nor outside options have a significant impact on posted salaries in these industries. These results suggest that increased employer concentration is not associated With higher wages in low-skill industries.33  \n\n### 4.2.2 High-Skill Industries  \n\nTurning our attention to high-skill industries, our analysis yields contrasting results, as summarized in Panel B of Table 5. In these sectors, employer concentration does not appear to exert a notable influence on the turnover rate. Instead, the pivotal factor driving turnover rates in high-skill industries is outside options, which significantly elevate them. This effect holds true for both high-school and college-educated workers. Interestingly, the impact of outside options on turnover rates is more pronounced among high-school-educated workers. This suggests that while high-school workers do not significantly respond to outside options in low-skill industries, they do so for outside options in high-skill industries, which could reflect the quality of outside option or better measurement of job opportunities.  \n\nFurthermore, when examining posted salaries in high-skill industries (Table 5 Panel B, Column 4), we find that outside options have a positive and significant effect on the salaries of college-educated workers. This outcome suggests that increased outside options could enable workers to renegotiate higher wages with firms, potentially motivating firms to offer more attractive compensation packages to retain talent. This phenomenon may also be driven by firms' proactive efforts to counter external job offers and secure valuable human capital.  \n\nIn summary, our analysis confirms that employer concentration plays a more dominant role in reducing turnover rates within low-skill industries, while outside options emerge as a crucial driver of turnover dynamics in high-skill sectors. Furthermore, the level of education appears to have nuanced effects, with outside options contributing more significantly to the turnover rate of high-school-educated workers in high-skill industries. Additionally, while employer concentration does not significantly impact posted salaries, increased outside options can lead to higher salaries, especially for college-educated workers in high-skill industries.  \n\n## 4.3 Robustness  \n\nWe conduct robustness analysis with respect to workers age, the area of local labor markets, and the aggregation level of industries, respectively. We consider seven age groups (19-21, 19-24, 19-34, 19-44, 19-54, 19-64, 19-99), three areas (county, commuting zone, MSA), and two industry code levels (NAICS2, NAICS3).34  \n\nWe summarize the results on the turnover rate. When we vary, e.g., the age groups, we keep the other specifications the same as in Section 4.1. The effects of both employer concentration and outside options are robust across age groups. As expected, the effects are the most significant for younger workers.  \n\nWe turn to the robustness analysis with respect to the area of local markets. The effects are similar when we define local labor markets at the three-digit-NAICS-industry-by-MSA level, with the estimates equal to -0.0067 (0.0016) and 0.0367 (0.0066) for the HHI and outside options, respectively.  \n\nWhen we define local markets at three-digit-NAICS-industry-by-county level, the estimates are -0.0071 (0.0014) and 0.0361 (0.0046) for the HHI and outside options, respectively. Both estimates are slightly larger in magnitude, which is consistent with employers exercising more labor market power locally and lower costs of switching jobs within county than within commuting zones.  \n\nFinally, utilizing local markets defined at the two-digit-NAICS-industry-by-commutingzone level, we find that estimates for the HHI and outside options are -0.0067 (0.0015) and 0.0290 (0.0055), respectively. These figures are somewhat lower in magnitude compared to our baseline results. This difference might stem from increased switching costs across two-digit NAICS industries, leading to a less pronounced response in workers' turnover rates to vacancies in other industries within this classification. Nonetheless, it is important to note that as long as the HHI and outside options are consistently measured at the corresponding level, their effects do not exhibit significant variation.35  \n\n# 5 Discussion  \n\nThe empirical analysis reveals three results: 1) Employer concentration decreases the turnover rate while outside option increases them; 2) The negative effects of employer concentration are stronger in low-skill industries; 3) The positive effects of outside option are stronger in high-skill industries.  \n\nOur heterogeneity analysis leads us to conclude that these findings are indicative of the presence of fewer switching opportunities and slower labor market dynamism. In this section, we forge a link between the influence of employer concentration and outside options on turnover rates and their consequent effects on realized wages. To achieve this, we extend the model presented in Section 2 to incorporate multiple sectors and bilateral switching, subsequently calibrating the model to the U.S. economy for the purpose of conducting counterfactual analyses. We relegate the details of the model to Appendix Section B.  \n\nOur calibration process effectively matches worker flows between two-digit NAICS industries, vacancy posting shares within these industries, and average wages across industries. In our counterfactual exercise, we observe that a $5\\%$ reduction in the turnover rate due to increased employer concentration results in a $1.1\\%$ decline in the average wage.  \n\nThis outcome signifies that changes in the turnover rate can explain approximately $40\\%$ of the overall wage-reducing effect stemming from increased employer concentration.36 Therefore, the effect on the turnover rate could present an important mechanism through which employer concentration decreases wages.37  \n\nOur calibrated model also suggests that the effects are more pronounced in sectors characterized by higher concentration and lower productivity. This arises from the fact that less productive sectors experience fewer flows of workers toward more productive sectors, thereby receiving fewer job offers from those domains. Meanwhile, greater concentration restricts the number of offers from other firms within the same sector, further accentuating the decline in wages. These findings resonate with our empirical observations, where we ascertain that high-school-educated workers in low-skill industries are notably affected by employer concentration shocks.  \n\n## 5.1 Sector-Specific Minimum Wages  \n\nGiven the large effects of employer concentration on turnover rates and wages, we explore the potential policy intervention of sector-specific minimum wages. In Appendix Section B.6, we demonstrate that such sector-specific minimum wages can serve as a lower bound on workers' share of surplus, without dissuading labor market mobility, as shown by Liu (2022b). This is attributed to the fact that more productive sectors tend to exhibit higher minimum wages, and these sector-specific minimum wages do not compress wages by industry  \n\nIn the event that we establish sector-specific minimum wages to mirror the value of working at the least productive firms within each sector, we find that a $5\\%$ reduction in the turnover rate would result in a mere $0.2\\%$ decline in the average wage. While higher minimum wages would lead to enhanced wage gains, they could also contribute to decreased employment levels. Thus, our analysis suggests that sector- or occupationspecific minimum wages hold the potential to address the varying impacts of employer concentration on different segments of the labor market. It's important to note that comprehensive research on the consequences of such minimum wage policies on wages and employment is a subject worthy of exploration, although it falls beyond the scope of this study.  \n\n# 6 Conclusion  \n\nWe estimate the effects of employer concentration and outside options on the turnover rate. Using instrumental variables that utilize plausibly exogenous firm-level nationwide growth in vacancies, we find that employer concentration decreases the turnover rate while outside options increase it. Moving from the 25th to 75th percentile of employer concentration implies a $5\\%$ decline in the turnover rate, while the same exercise for outside options increases the turnover rate by $39\\%$ . The effects of employer concentration are stronger for low-skill industries and high-school workers.  \n\nFurthermore, our quantitative analysis uncovers a relationship between turnover rates and wages. Specifically, we observe that the decline in the turnover rate contributes significantly to wage reductions following an increase in employer concentration, accounting for $40\\%$ of the overall wage decline. In light of these findings, we posit that the implementation of sector-specific minimum wages could offer a viable avenue for mitigating the adverse wage effects induced by employer concentration. Moreover, such sector-specific minimum wages have the potential to address the heterogeneous effects of employer concentration across sectors and worker skill levels.  \n\n# References  \n\nAcemoglu, Daron and Jorn-Steffen Pischke, \"The Structure of Wages and Investment in General Training,\" Journal of Political Economy, 1999, 107 (3), 539-572.   \nAltonji, Joseph G. and Nicolas Williams, \"The Effects of Labor Market Experience, Job Seniority, and Job Mobility on Wage Growth,\" NBER Working Paper, 1992.   \nArnold, David, \"Mergers and Acquisitions, Local Labor Market Concentration, and Worker Outcomes,\" Working Paper, 2020.   \nAzar, José, Ioana Marinescu, and Marshall Steinbaum, \"Labor Market Concentration,\" Journal of Human Resources, 2020, pp. 1218-9914R1.   \n- - , Marshall I Steinbaum, and Bledi Taska, \"Concentration in US Labor Markets: Evidence from Online Vacancy Data,\" Labour Economics, 2022, 66.   \nBagga, Sadhika, \"Firm Market Power, Worker Mobility, and Wages in the US Labor Market,\" Journal of Labor Economics, 2023.   \nBahn, Kate,\"Understanding the Importance of Monopsony Power in the US Labor Market,\" Technical Report, Washington Center for Equitable Growth, 2018.   \nBartel, Ann P. and George J.

In other words, a local shock from a commuting-zone-by-industry submarket cannot cause a nationwide expansion or contraction of the firm. We show in Appendix Section A.6 that the variation in the instrumental variable uses almost exclusively changes in large employers^ vacancies, which are arguably less likely to be affected by shocks to a single commuting-zone-by-industry local market.  \n\nSecond, there needs to be sufficient firm-level shocks to the instrumental variable, and we note that the large F-statistics of the 2SLS results provides support for this assumption.  \n\n### A.1.2 Outside Options Instrumental Variable  \n\nThe exclusion restriction for the instrumental variable on outside options is  \n\n$$\nC o v\\Big[O O_{i,c,t}^{I V},\\epsilon_{i,c,t}\\big|\\gamma_{i t},\\eta_{c t}\\Big]=\\mathbb{E}\\Bigg[\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\sum_{i\\in N^{i n d}}\\pi_{i k}\\frac{v_{k,c,2007}}{v_{k,2007}}v_{k,\\mathrm{k},t}\\epsilon_{i,c,t}\\big|\\gamma_{i t},\\eta_{c t}\\Bigg]\\to0\n$$  \n\nEquation (A.2) requires two assumptions to hold: First, the national wide leave-one-out vacancy postings $v_{k,\\updelta,t}$ is not affected by local vacancy postings in industry $i$ and commuting zone $c$ through a direct channel other than increasing the quality of local outside options $O O_{i,c,t}^{I V},$ i, conditional on controlling for fixed effects. One case that would violate the assumption is that a positive shock to the turnover rate in, e.g., Retail Trade industry in a commuting zone in Arkansas triggers changes in the average turnover rate in, e.g., Food industry in other commuting zones of the US. We note that our results are robust to varying local markets to be at the MSA or NAICS two-digit industry level, whose leave-one-out average turnover rates are arguably unlikely to be affected by local shocks.  \n\nSecond, the nationwide leave-one-out mean turnover rates need to be correlated with local turnover rates of industry $i$ in commuting zone $c$ , and our large F-statistics shows that this is likely the case.  \n\n### A.1.3 Correlation between the Instrumental Variables and Local Shocks  \n\nTo support our identification argument, we follow Borusyak et al. (2022) and examine the cross-sectional correlation between the instrumental variables and measures of local shocks. Because the commuting-zone-by-time and industry-by-time fixed effects absorb many available variables that approximate local shocks, we rely on our data, namely QWI and BGT data, to construct local shocks. For example, we would like to use log GDP at the NAICS-three-digit-industry-by-commuting-zone level, which is not publicly available to the best of our knowledge. Commuting-zone level GDP would be absorbed by the fixed effects.  \n\nWe use three variables to proxy local shocks: the lag of employment-to-population ratio, lag of log posted salary, and lag of the fraction of college workers. These variables could capture low frequency changes in local market conditions, while they should not correlate with our instrumental variables if these shocks are indeed local after controlling for fixed effects. The empirical specification is Equation (11) with the instrumental variables Equation (13) and Equation (14).  \n\nTable A.1 shows that there is no significant correlation except for the outside option IV on lag of employment-to-population ratio. Therefore, we do not find evidence of confounding factors that could violate the exclusion restriction.  \n\nTable A.1: Correlation of HHI IV and Outside Option IV with Local Shocks   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td rowspan=\"2\">(1) Emp-Pop. Ratio</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(2) College Frac.</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(3) Salary</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>log(HHIIV)</td><td>0.0000 (0.0001)</td><td>0.0019 (0.0019)</td><td>0.0013</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">log(O0V)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0008)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.0031</td><td>-0.0061</td><td>0.0101</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0010)</td><td>(0.0147)</td><td>(0.0134)</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>136,531</td><td>128,654</td><td>92,170</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nIn addition, Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020) suggest examining the correlation between the initial vacancy shares and initial local controls to validate the exogeneity of the instrumental variable for outside options. Table A.2 shows that local markets vacancy shares do not significantly correlate with fraction of college workers or log salary in 2007. We note that other local shocks at the industry-by-time or commuting-zone-by-time level should be absorbed by fixed effects in the 2SLS regression. The exercise should further assuage concerns regarding the shift-share instrumental variable for outside options.  \n\nTable A.2: Correlation of Initial Vacancy Share and Initial Local Controls   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>(1)</td></tr><tr><td>Fraction College 0.0024</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0016)</td></tr><tr><td>Log Salary 0.0006</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0004) 13,614</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### A.2Using Occupation Flow Public Dataset to Construct Outside Options  \n\nIn this section, we use the Occupation Flow Public Dataset by Schubert et al. (2021) to construct industry flows. Specifically, the flow probability between any two industry is defined as:  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{i k}=\\sum_{o\\in i}\\sum_{p\\in k}\\delta_{o}^{i}\\delta_{p}^{k}\\lambda_{o p}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\lambda_{o p}$ is the worker flow between two occupations at 6-digit SOC level and $\\delta_{o}^{i}$ is the share of occupation $o$ vacancy postings in industry $i$ . By construction, the outflows from an industry sum to one, so we can compare the results with those using CPS worker flows.  \n\nBefore moving to the results, we discuss the advantage and disadvantage of using the public dataset. The advantage is that Equation (A.3) allows characterizing flow probability between any two three-digit NAICS industries, whereas we can only match a subset of three-digit NAICS industries using four-digit Census industry code in CPS.  \n\nThe biggest disadvantage is that the public dataset, which is based on resume data, might not be representative of the flow probability in low-skill industries. For example, workers in low-skill industries might not use resumes as often as workers in high-skill industries. In the extreme case that the resume data misses all switches between jobs in low-skill industries, Equation (A.3) would assign zero probability to flows between low-skill industries. For example, suppose the vacancy postings increase in retail trade industry. For workers in, e.g. transportation industry, it would appear that the change in outside options is minimal. However, the turnover rate, measured using QWI data, is likely to respond in retail trade industry, leading to a small or imprecisely measured effect of outside options.  \n\nOn the other hand, because the resume data likely over-samples switches between high-skill industries, the effects of outside options in those industries could be exaggerated.  \n\nIn addition, Equation (A.3) aggregates from occupation flows to industry flows using online vacancy postings, which could further disproportionately represent high-skill jobs, leading to even larger measurement errors.  \n\nTable A.3 shows that the results indeed reflect the potential issues with using resume data to measure flow probabilities. The table replicates Table 3, but flow probabilities, and therefore, outside options, are constructed using Equation (A.3).  \n\nTable A.3: The Effects of Labor Market Power on the Turnover Rate: Using Resume Data to Construct Flow Probability   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(8)</td><td>(9)</td></tr><tr><td>log(HHI)</td><td>-0.0050 (0.0005)</td><td>-0.0054 (0.0015)</td><td>-0.0052 (0.0016)</td><td>-0.0047 (0.0016)</td><td>-0.0106 (0.0023)</td><td>-0.0045 (0.0015)</td><td>0.0041 (0.0032)</td><td>-0.0018 (0.0031)</td><td>-0.0134 (0.0034)</td></tr><tr><td>log(00)</td><td>-0.0128 (0.0083)</td><td>0.0634 (0.0219) Y</td><td>0.0662 (0.0230)</td><td>0.0694 (0.0238)</td><td>0.0017 (0.0296)</td><td>0.0354 (0.0159)</td><td>0.4640 (0.0450)</td><td>-0.0209 (0.0309)</td><td>0.0319 (0.0466)</td></tr><tr><td>Time Trend Local Control</td><td></td><td></td><td>Y Y Y</td><td>Y</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>High-School College</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>High-Skill Ind.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Med-Skill Ind.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Low-Skill Ind.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td></td><td>139,549</td><td>139,549</td><td>139,549</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>288,381</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>77,875</td><td>139,568</td><td>39,014</td><td>42,959</td><td>55,748</td></tr><tr><td>F-Stat</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>1596</td><td>1470</td><td>1498</td><td>1116</td><td>1603</td><td>577</td><td>446</td><td>441</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThere are two main discrepancies between the results in Table A.3 and Table 3. First, the baseline 2SLS regression (Table A.3 Column 2) yields an estimate of outside options to be 0.0634 (0.0219), a number that is almost twice as large as that in Table 3 Column (2). A further examination suggests that the large estimate is driven by that for high-skill industries, shown as 0.4640 (0.0159) in Column (7), whereas the effect is only 0.0458 (0.0112) in Table 3 Column (7). The current estimate suggests that moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile of outside options would increase the turnover rate by $303\\%$ in high-skill industries, a number that is likely too large, given that the median turnover rate is $23\\%$ The issue is consistent with the concern that the resume data over-estimates the effects of  \n\noutside options in high-skill industries.  \n\nThe second discrepancy is that the standard errors for outside options are larger. For example, the point estimate of outside options in low-skill industries (Table A.3 Column 9) is similar to that using CPS worker flows (Table 3 Column 9), but the former is imprecise and insignificant.  \n\nExcept for the two discrepancies, most results are consistent using either way of constructing outside options: employer concentration decreases the turnover rate of highschool-educated workers and workers in low-skill industries more, while outside options increase the turnover rate of college-educated workers and workers in high-skill industries more.  \n\nThis comparison should act as a cautionary note of the limitations inherent in using resume data to estimate flow probabilities between occupations or industries. Such caution is particularly relevant when the outcome variable pertains to the broader labor market dynamics, rather than being narrowly focused on high-skill occupations or industries. This distinction is crucial for ensuring accurate and representative labor market analyses.  \n\n### A.3 Vacancy Postings Growth and Worker Quality  \n\nThis section shows the correlation between vacancy postings growth and measures of worker quality in three-digit-NAICS-industry-by-commuting-zone local markets.  \n\nOur measures of worker quality include lags of fraction of college workers, fraction vacancies requiring a college degree, and log wage. We note that variation at the commutingZone-by-time and industry-by-time levels are absorbed by fixed effects. Table A.4 shows no correlation between vacancy growth or its instrumental variable $(\\tilde{g}_{i,c,t})$ in a local market and measures of worker quality. Combined with our robustness analysis by controlling for local worker quality, the evidence should assuage concerns that the effects of employer concentration and outside options are driven by changing worker composition.  \n\nTable A.4: Correlation Between Vacancy Growth and Worker Quality   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Vacancy Growth</td><td>Vacancy Growth IV</td></tr><tr><td>Log Wage</td><td>-0.0244 (0.0175)</td><td>-0.0343</td></tr><tr><td>Fraction College</td><td>-0.0339</td><td>(0.0296) -0.0272</td></tr><tr><td>Vacancy College</td><td>(0.0650) 0.0142 (0.0265)</td><td>(0.0941) -0.0362 (0.0222)</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>384,316</td><td>384,316</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### A.4  Comparing BGT and JOLTS Vacancy by Industry  \n\nBecause the BGT data includes only online vacancy postings, it might not be representative of the full labor market, upon which the QWI turnover rates are based. Specifically, vacancies in BGT could over-represent job openings for high-skill workers.  \n\nWe note that we are not aware of dataset that characterize the average skill content of job openings in an industry for the entire labor market. The data that has the number of job openings by industry is Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which we use to compare with the BGT data in the number of vacancies by industry.  \n\nFigure A.1 shows that the two dataset do not differ drastically in the fraction of vacancies by industry. Construction, Finance and Insurance, Professional Services, and Educational Services see the largest difference. However, the differences are not systematic, because JOLTS has more openings in Construction and Professional Services while the BGT data has more openings in the other two industries.  \n\n![](images/d7b382436aef623b8a25a6e8bfb1bda38b0d48a3fe60a611cd7dcf4c1dfb66ba.jpg)  \nFigure A.1: Comparison of BGT and JOLTS Job Openings by Industry  \n\nWe note again that the similar does not rule out the possibility that the skill contents of the openings in these two dataset are different. However, to the extent that the BGT data include many openings in low-skill sectors, e.g., Accommodation and Food Services, we argue that the BGT data partially measures the job openings in the whole labor market, which resonates with the conclusion in Hershbein and Kahn (2018).  \n\n### A.5 Details of the Robustness Analysis  \n\n#### A.5.1 Robustness with Respect to Age  \n\nSection 4.3 suggests that we define seven age groups: 19-21, 19-24, 19-34, 19-44, 19-54, 19-64, 19-99. For each age group, we construct the turnover rate at the three-digit-NAICSindustry-by-commuting-zone level, and the HHI is the same as in the baseline. We use turnover rates of the corresponding age group for outside options. Table A.5 shows the point estimates, which use heteroskedasticity-robust commuting-zone-clustered standard errors. The reported F-stat is the Kleibergen-Paap Wald F-statistic.  \n\nTable A.5: Robustness with Respect to Age   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"7\">Panel A: Turnover Rate</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td></tr><tr><td>log(HHI)</td><td>-0.0072 (0.0035)</td><td>-0.0069 (0.0028)</td><td>-0.0059 (0.0020)</td><td>-0.0064 (0.0018)</td><td>-0.0069 (0.0016)</td><td>-0.0069 (0.0015)</td><td>-0.0069 (0.0015)</td></tr><tr><td>log(00)</td><td>0.1158 (0.0162)</td><td>0.0890 (0.0116)</td><td>0.0464 (0.0077)</td><td>0.0371 (0.0070)</td><td>0.0335 (0.0064)</td><td>0.0312 (0.0060)</td><td>0.0319 (0.0059)</td></tr><tr><td>2SLS N</td><td>Y 97,409</td><td>Y 101,297</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y 128,459</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>F-Stat</td><td>1443</td><td>1475</td><td>104,970 1488</td><td>126,851 1491</td><td>1479</td><td>128,459 1482</td><td>128,459 1483</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### A.5.2 Robustness with respect to Area  \n\nWe define two areas of local labor markets: County and MSA. For each one, we restrict the QWI sample to workers between age 19 and 54. And then, we construct the turnover rate, short-duration employment rate, ${\\mathrm{HH}},$ and outside options as in Equations (7), (8) and (10). Equations (13) and (14) specify the instrumental variables. Table A.6 shows the point estimates, which cluster standard errors at the corresponding aggregation level.  \n\n#### A.5.3 Robustness with respect to NAICS Code  \n\nWe define one aggregation levels of NAICS industry code: NAICS2. We restrict the QWI sample to workers between age 19 and 54. And then, we construct the turnover rate, short-duration employment rate, HHI, and outside options as in Equations (7), (8) and (10). Equations (13) and (14) specify the instrumental variables. Table A.7 shows the point estimates, which use heteroskedasticity-robust commuting-zone-clustered standard errors.  \n\nTable A.6: Robustness with Respect to Area   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Turnover Rate</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td></tr><tr><td>log(HHI)</td><td>-0.0071 (0.0014)</td><td>-0.0067 (0.0016)</td></tr><tr><td>log(00)</td><td>0.0361 (0.0046)</td><td>0.0367 (0.0066)</td></tr><tr><td>2SLS</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>County MSA</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>N F-Stat</td><td>247,899</td><td>157,267</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable A.7: Robustness with Respect to Industry Level of Aggregation   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>TurnoverRate (1)</td></tr><tr><td>log(HHI) -0.0067</td></tr><tr><td>(0.0015) 0.0290</td></tr><tr><td>log(00) (0.0055)</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>N 86,381</td></tr><tr><td>F-Stat 561</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### A.6 Vacancy Postings by Firms From 2010 to 2019  \n\nWe aggregate the total vacancy postings by employer from 2010 to 2019. Table A.8 shows the distribution. The total vacancy postings are skewed towards the right, because the median firm posted 2 vacancies while firms in the 99th percentile posted 438 vacancies. Over $25\\%$ of employers only posted one vacancy in 10 years, which suggests the importance of large employers in driving employer concentration.  \n\nTable A.8: Distribution of Total Vacancy Postings by Employer   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Percentile</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>25</td><td>50</td><td>75</td><td>90</td><td>95</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>Total Vacancies</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>17</td><td>47</td><td>438</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWe define large employers to be those whose vacancy postings are above the 99th percentile of vacancy postings distribution. We calculate the fraction of local markets with large and small employers, respectively, to understand the variation in our instrumental variable. Similarly, we decompose the HHI instrumental variable by large and small employers to see which firms contribute to the variation of the HHI instrumental variable.  \n\nTable A.9: Fractions of Markets with Large and Small Employers   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>HHI Large i,c,t</td><td>HHISmall i,c,t</td><td>IVLarge IHH i,c,t</td><td>usAiIHH i,c,t</td></tr><tr><td>Fraction</td><td>92.4%</td><td>42.7%</td><td>37.2%</td><td>7.4%</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable A.9 shows that less than half of the markets have small employers, namely those whose total vacancies are below the 99th percentile. This suggests that the BGT data could under-represent the small employers. Meanwhile, the instrumental variable is primarily driven by vacancy postings of large employers, whose presence is five times larger than that of small employers, which makes our instrumental variable more likely to satisfy the exclusion restriction.  \n\n### A.7  Construction of HHI and Outside Options by Education and Summary Statistics  \n\nWhen constructing the HHI and outside options by education, we utilize the education requirement in the BGT data. For high-school workers, we exclude vacancy postings that require a college degree, and calculate the HHI with the remaining vacancies. We separately aggregate worker flows in CPS based their education attainment, so that the Worker flows are specific to high-school- or college-educated workers. After obtaining the worker flows, we calculate the outside options using Equation (10). Table A.10 shows the resulting HHI and outside options, as well as the turnover rate in the QWI data.  \n\nTable A.10: Summary Statistics by Education   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Percentile</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>25</td><td>50</td><td>75</td><td>90</td><td>95</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>HHI: High-School</td><td>41</td><td>160</td><td>337</td><td>1007</td><td>2431</td><td>4634</td><td>6439</td><td>7661</td><td>10000</td></tr><tr><td>HHI: College</td><td>44</td><td>172</td><td>350</td><td>1013</td><td>2428</td><td>4664</td><td>6544</td><td>7812</td><td>10000</td></tr><tr><td>Outside Option: High-School</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>19</td><td>65</td><td>233</td><td>804</td><td>1739</td><td>5824</td></tr><tr><td>Outside Option: College</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>25</td><td>28</td><td>350</td><td>1358</td><td>3210</td><td>12022</td></tr><tr><td>Turnover Rate: High-School</td><td>1.7</td><td>4.1</td><td>6.5</td><td>12.1</td><td>19.8</td><td>29.2</td><td>41.7</td><td>51.9</td><td>80.3</td></tr><tr><td>Turnover Rate: College</td><td>1.5</td><td>3.7</td><td>6.0</td><td>11.0</td><td>18.3</td><td>27.3</td><td>39.5</td><td>49.3</td><td>76.2</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### A.8 Summary Statistics by Education and by Industry Skills  \n\nTable A.11 presents the summary statistics of the HHI, outside options, and turnover rate by industry skills.  \n\nTable A.11: Summary Statistics by Industry Skills   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Percentile</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>25</td><td>50</td><td>75</td><td>90</td><td>95</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>HHI: High Skill Industries</td><td>63</td><td>201</td><td>369</td><td>979</td><td>2487</td><td>4876</td><td>6735</td><td>7951</td><td>10000</td></tr><tr><td>HHI: Mid Skill Industries</td><td>69</td><td>234</td><td>430</td><td>1043</td><td>2222</td><td>4129</td><td>6143</td><td>7396</td><td>10000</td></tr><tr><td>HHI: Low Skill Industries</td><td>29</td><td>113</td><td>255</td><td>1007</td><td>2543</td><td>5000</td><td>6800</td><td>7944</td><td>10000</td></tr><tr><td>Outside Option: High Skill Industries</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>24</td><td>84</td><td>333</td><td>1310</td><td>3090</td><td>11975</td></tr><tr><td>Outside Option: Mid Skill Industries</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>25</td><td>86</td><td>339</td><td>1289</td><td>3007</td><td>9206</td></tr><tr><td>Outside Option: Low Skill Industries</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>23</td><td>81</td><td>308</td><td>1138</td><td>2614</td><td>7368</td></tr><tr><td>Turnover Rate: High Skill Industries</td><td>1.1</td><td>2.7</td><td>4.6</td><td>9.6</td><td>17.5</td><td>29.2</td><td>40.5</td><td>52.0</td><td>95.0</td></tr><tr><td>Turnover Rate: Mid Skill Industries</td><td>1.5</td><td>4.1</td><td>6.9</td><td>12.6</td><td>19.9</td><td>29.2</td><td>42.0</td><td>55.3</td><td>88.3</td></tr><tr><td>Turnover Rate: Low Skill Industries</td><td>2.6</td><td>6.7</td><td>10.9</td><td>19.8</td><td>27.0</td><td>39.8</td><td>51.0</td><td>58.6</td><td>76.9</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### A.9 Heterogeneity Analysis Using County-Level Local Markets  \n\nThe heterogeneity analysis in Section 4.1 reveals a smaller effect of outside options in lowskill industries. One possibility is that workers in low-skill industries search more locally, so that the attractiveness of job openings quickly diminishes as the distance increases. For example, these workers might not search for jobs that are more than 5 miles away, even if these jobs are in the same commuting zone.  \n\nWe conduct heterogeneity analysis with county-by-three-digit-NAICS industry local markets, because county is the smallest area of local markets that we have turnover data. Table A.12 suggests that the estimates of outside options are larger for both high- and low-skill industries, which is consistent with a smaller switching cost between jobs within the same county. In addition, employer concentration has a larger impact on the turnover rate, possibly because increasing concentration implies fewer opportunities when the market size is small.  \n\nWe note that workers in high-skill industries still respond more to outside options than those in low-skill industries, so market size cannot explain the smaller response to outside options in low-skill industries.  \n\nAnother concern is that the instrumental variable for outside options could correlate with that for employer concentration. This would be case if some firms' vacancy postings are correlated in multiple industries, e.g., Walmart hires more software engineers and store associates to support the business. We evaluate the extent to which the effects of employer concentration are affected by the instrumental variable of outside options and vice versa by excluding one of the instrumental variables. For example, when using only the instrumental variable for employer concentration, we simply include the non-instrumented outside options in our 2SLS regression (Equation 11)  \n\nTable A.12: The Effects of Labor Market Power on the Turnover Rate: County-Level Heterogeneity   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">(1)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(2)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(3)</td></tr><tr><td>log(HHI)</td><td>-0.0066</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">log(00)</td><td>(0.0024)</td><td>0.0046 (0.0031)</td><td>-0.0174 (0.0031)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.0507 (0.0089)</td><td>0.0112 (0.0076)</td><td>0.0310 (0.0098)</td></tr><tr><td>2SLS</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>High-Skill Ind.</td><td>Y</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Med-Skill Ind.</td><td></td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Low-Skill Ind.</td><td></td><td></td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>59,073</td><td>76,647</td><td>106,008</td></tr><tr><td>F-Stat</td><td>715</td><td>553</td><td>774</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable A.13 suggests similar estimates of the instrumental variables to those in the baseline.

And then, we extend the theoretical framework to the full model in Section 5. We discuss the estimation and the counterfactual exercise of improving hiring technology.  \n\n### B.1 Comparative Statics of Theoretical Framework  \n\nSection 2 argues that a lower job-finding rate or separation rate would reduce the impact of employer concentration, because when workers tend to stay with the current employer, and the distribution of outside offers have smaller impacts on turnovers. We demonstrate the argument numerically.  \n\nFigure B.1 plots the cases when we decrease the job-finding rate from 0.4 to 0.3 or the separation rate from 0.028 to 0.02. In both cases, the slope of the curve is reduced compared to that of the baseline $\\mathit{\\Omega}(\\lambda=0.4$ and $\\delta=0.028^{\\cdot}$ ), suggesting weaker effects of employer concentration on the turnover rate.  \n\n![](images/bf6389ff00c56f893ecb5ef799cb865e00a2dfe901a83269b8aa7c6b368d122c.jpg)  \nFigure B.1: Comparative Statics  \n\nOne can also prove analytically that the slope of the turnover-rate-employer-concentration curve is increasing in the job-finding rate and separation rate using Equation (5), namely $\\partial^{2}\\overline{{m}}/\\partial\\sigma_{2}\\partial\\lambda>0$ and $\\partial^{2}\\overline{{m}}/\\partial\\sigma_{2}\\partial\\delta>0$ This translates to the smaller (less negative) slope in Figure B.1.  \n\n### B.2 Full Model Economy  \n\nWe describe the full model in Section 5 in more detail. Time is continuous. There is a continuum of ex ante homogeneous workers and $J$ sectors. In each sector, there are a finite number of infinitely lived firms, $i=1,...,M_{j},$ that differ in the firm-specific productivity $\\{z_{i}\\}_{i=1,\\dots,M_{j}}$ . The notion ${}^{\\prime\\prime}\\mathrm{firm}^{\\prime\\prime}$ here is tied to the pre-determined vector of productivity. While the worker-firm pair could dissolve, the probability that a worker meets with firm $i$ stays the same in the stationary equilibrium. Both firms and workers are risk-neutral with subjective discount rate $\\rho$  \n\nUnemployed workers receive unemployment benefit $b$ and meet firm $i$ With probability $\\lambda(z_{i})$ . Upon receiving an offer from a firm, the worker and the firm determine the wage contract sequentially by mutual agreement as in Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002). Workers can renegotiate upon receiving an outside offer. The current and the poaching firm Bertrand-compete for the worker.  \n\nThe outside offer can come from other firms in the same sector or employers in different sectors. For the former, the arrival rate of offers is dictated by $\\{\\lambda(z_{i})\\}$ . Because the number of firms is finite, the fact that workers do not receive offers from the current employer has a non-trivial impact on the probability that they receive outside offers. Outside the worker's sector, firms could poach the worker, but the poaching rate is affected by the probability of switching $\\{\\pi_{j\\to k}\\}$ between sector $j$ and $k$ . Besides endogenous worker turnovers through poaching and job-finding, there are also exogenous turnovers through separation at the rate $\\delta_{s}$ and labor market exit at the rate $\\delta_{d}$ . New workers enter the labor market at the rate $\\delta_{d}$ to keep the measure of workers constant.  \n\nWorkers can learn on the job. In particular, an employed worker start at a firm with firm-specific human capital $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t=0}=\\underline{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}(\\boldsymbol{z})$ which evolves according to  \n\n$$\nd x_{t}=\\mu(x,z)d t+\\sigma(x,z)d W_{t}\n$$  \n\nEquation (B.1) implies that tenure affects workers' productivity. As workers' skills grow over time, their output also changes. However, the skill accumulation is not deterministic, as it is subject to random shocks given by the Brownian motion process $\\{W_{t}\\}$ . For simplicity, we assume that workers' firm-specific human capital \"resets\" if they experience labor market turnovers. This assumption implies two things: 1) If a worker switch to another employer, the worker's firm-specific productivity starts at $\\underline{{x}}(z)$ for that employer; 2) The worker does not retain the firm-specific human capital even if the worker is employed at the same firm in the future.  \n\nThe first implication resonates with the notion that firm-specific human capitals differ from general human capitals (e.g., Acemoglu and Pischke, 1999). The second implication is stronger, but we note that when a worker is employed at the same employer repeatedly, the worker either was employed in another firm or unemployed. In both cases, the worker could spend sufficient time away from the employer that the firm-specific human capital has depreciated. Our assumption amounts to the extreme case that the depreciation rate is infinity.  \n\nLet us use one example to further illustrate what the assumption means. Suppose a retail worker works at Walmart first, switches to Target, and jumps back to Walmart. The worker's general knowledge of retail industry is retained. However, while the worker spends time away from Walmart, the store arrangement or item prices could have changed at Walmart, so that the worker needs to learn them even with past experience.  \n\nThe initial human capital $\\underline{{x}}(z)$ corresponds to hiring technology. As is clear later in the section, workers' output decreases if the firm-specific human capital is further below the firm's productivity $z$ , which creates switching incentives. On the other hand, if the initial human capital is closer to the firm's productivity, the worker and the firm form a good match in the sense that the output and hence the joint surplus is high, in which case the worker is hard to poach. Hence, an exogenous increase in the initial human capital can be interpreted as an improvement in the hiring technology.  \n\nLet the joint match surplus for a worker with firm-specific human capital $x$ at firm $z$ in sector $j$ be $S(x,z,j)$ . Bertrand competition implies that the share of surplus allocated to the worker is endogenous. For example, suppose the initial wage contract is $W$ . When the worker is poached by another employer with productivity $z^{\\prime}$ in sector $k,$ theworker stays if $S(x,z,j)\\geqslant S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},k)$ and moves to the poacher otherwise. In both cases, the worker receives a new wage contract $W^{\\prime}=\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{S(x,z,j),\\operatorname*{max}\\left\\{S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},k),W\\right\\}\\right\\}$ . That is, the worker's new wage contract has a value equal to the joint surplus at the poacher if the worker stays or the joint surplus at the previous employer if the worker leaves.  \n\nDenote the worker's share of surplus by $\\eta,$ given by  \n\n$$\n\\eta=\\frac{S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},k)-U}{S(x,z,j)-U}\n$$  \n\nwhere $U$ is the value of unemployment. We follow Lise and Postel-Vinay (2020) and assume that this share is constant when the worker does not receive outside offers.  \n\n### B.3 Equilibrium  \n\nWe first derive the expression for the joint surplus, given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\delta_{s}+\\delta_{d})S(x,z,j)=y(x,z,j)+\\mu(x,z)\\partial_{x}S+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}(x,z)\\partial_{x x}S+\\delta_{s}U}}\\ {{+\\displaystyle\\sum_{z^{\\prime}\\neq z}\\alpha\\lambda(z^{\\prime})\\mathbb{E}\\Big\\lbrace{\\mathbb{I}}_{\\left\\{S({\\underline{{{z}}}},z^{\\prime},j)>S(x,z,j)\\right\\}}[W(x,z^{\\prime},j,\\eta)-S(x,z,j)]\\Big\\rbrace}}\\ {{+\\displaystyle\\sum_{k\\neq j}\\pi_{j\\to k}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{k}}\\alpha\\lambda(z_{i k})\\mathbb{E}\\Big\\lbrace{\\mathbb{I}}_{\\left\\{S({\\underline{{{z}}}},z^{\\prime},k)>S(x,z,j)\\right\\rbrace}}[W(x,z^{\\prime},k,\\eta)-S}}\\ {{=y(x,z,j)+\\mu(x,z)\\partial_{x}S+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}(x,z)\\partial_{x x}S+\\delta_{s}U}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $y(x,z,j)$ is the output and $\\alpha$ is on-the-job-search efficiency. On the left-hand side, the joint surplus is discounted by the subjective discount rate, as well as the separation rate and the labor market exit rate. On the right-hand side, the match receives flow output $y(x,z,j)$ , and workers' skill evolution implies that the value of the joint surplus is also changing overtime. When the worker is unemployed, the joint surplus becomes the value of unemployment. The second line in Equation (B.3) shows the value paid to the worker when there are offers from other firms in the same sector. Conditional on the joint surplus of the offer being greater than the current joint surplus, the worker would turnover to the other firm and get $W(x,z^{\\prime},j,\\eta)$ . Similarly, the third line represents the change in the joint surplus if the worker receives offers from firms in other sectors, where $\\pi_{j\\to k}$ is the probability of switching from sector $j$ to sector $k$ . The offer arrival rates are given by $\\{\\lambda(z^{\\prime})\\}$ and $\\{\\lambda(z_{i k})\\}$  \n\nBertrand competition is particularly useful because the value of switching to other employers, whether within the same sector or across sectors, drops out. The poacher always offers the worker the current joint surplus as the initial wage contract. Employer switching hence affects the allocation of workers but not the joint surplus. In particular, the share of surplus pledged to the worker is irrelevant for mobility.38 Equation (B.3) line 2 makes it explicit that the worker does not receive offers from the same employer.  \n\nThe value of unemployment solves  \n\n$$\n(\\rho+\\delta_{d})U=b\n$$  \n\nSimilar to the joint value, the value of finding a job drops out because the employer offers  \n\nthe worker the value of unemployment. Together with worker homogeneity, the value of unemployment is independent of sectors.  \n\nFor an employed worker, let $w(x,z,j,\\eta)$ be the wage function that delivers the wage value $W(x,z,j,\\eta)=U+\\eta[S(x,z,j)-U],$ which satisfies  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c l}{+}&{\\displaystyle+\\delta_{d})W(x,z,j,\\eta)=w(x,z,j,\\eta)+\\mu(x,z)\\partial_{x}W+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}(x,z)\\partial_{x x}W+\\delta_{s}U}\\ &{\\displaystyle\\qquad+\\sum_{z^{\\prime}\\neq z}\\lambda(z^{\\prime})\\mathbb{E}\\Big\\{\\mathbb{I}_{\\left\\{S(x,z,j)\\geqslant S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},j)\\right\\}}\\left[S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},j)-W(x,z,j,\\eta)\\right]\\Big\\}}\\ &{\\displaystyle\\qquad+\\sum_{k\\neq j}\\pi_{j\\to k}\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{k}}\\lambda(z_{i k})\\mathbb{E}\\Big\\{\\mathbb{I}_{\\left\\{S(x,z,j)\\geqslant S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},k)\\right\\}}\\left[S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},k)-W(x,z,j,\\eta)\\right]\\Big\\}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe worker's wage contract or value of employment changes because of flow wages, skill accumulation, separation, and labor market exit. On the second line, when the worker is poached by another employer in the same sector, the worker receives a new wage contract if the current employer successfully retains the worker. Otherwise, the worker leaves and receives a value of employment that is equal to the current wage contract. The third line is similar and corresponds to poaching from other sectors.  \n\nThe wage function makes Equations (B.3) to (B.5) and $W(x,z,j,\\eta)=U+\\eta[S(x,z,j)-U]$ hold continuously, which implies that the wage function is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle x,z,j,\\eta)=\\eta y(x,z,j)+(1-\\eta)b}}\\ {{\\displaystyle-\\sum_{z^{\\prime}\\neq z}\\alpha\\lambda(z^{\\prime})\\mathbb{E}\\bigg\\{\\mathbb{I}_{\\left\\{S(x,z,j)\\geqslant S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},j)\\right\\}}\\left[S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},j)-\\eta S(x,z,j)-(1-\\eta)U\\right]}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle-\\sum_{k\\neq j}\\pi_{j\\rightarrow k}\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{k}}\\alpha\\lambda(z_{i k})\\mathbb{E}\\bigg\\{\\mathbb{I}_{\\left\\{S(x,z,j)\\geqslant S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},k)\\right\\}}\\left[S(\\underline{{x}},z^{\\prime},k)-\\eta S(x,z,j)-\\eta S(x,z,j)\\right]}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle...\\qquad...\\mathrm{~}..\\mathrm{~}..\\mathrm{~}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{=}\\eta y(z,x,j)+(1-\\eta)b\n$$  \n\nThe second line and the third line drop because of the definition of $\\eta$ .Equation (B.6) shows that the wage function is simple and intuitive under Bertrand competition. It is the weighted average of the output and the unemployment benefit where the weight $\\eta$ is endogenous and depends on the worker's offer history. The wage function is increasing with outside offers because the share of surplus pledged to the worker increases. Skill accumulation is also important because it affects the flow output.  \n\nIn the simple example in Section 2, we can solve analytically for the average wage as a function of the fraction of vacancy postings by firm 2 $\\sigma_{2}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\overline{{{w}}}=b\\left[\\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{(1+(\\delta_{s}/\\lambda)^{-1})(\\sigma_{2}+\\delta_{s}/\\lambda)}}+\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{(1-\\sigma_{2}+\\delta_{s}/\\lambda)(1+(\\delta_{s}/\\lambda)^{-1})}}\\right]}}\\ {{+w^{\\prime}\\left[\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{(1+\\delta_{s}/\\lambda)(\\sigma_{2}+\\delta_{2}/\\lambda)}}+\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\sigma_{2}-\\sigma_{2}^{2}}{(1-\\sigma_{2}+\\delta_{s}/\\lambda)(1+\\delta_{s}/\\lambda)}}\\right]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe average wage is non-monotonic with respect to the vacancy share of firm 2. At one extreme when the share is 0, workers are either unemployed or employed in firm 1, where their wage is $b$ regardless. At the other extreme when the share is 1, there is no poaching, so that all workers earn $b$ aswell.  \n\nLet the joint distribution of worker skills, firm productivity, and workers' share of surplusbe $\\{g(x,z,\\eta,j)\\}_{j=1,\\dots,J}$ . In the stationary quilibrium, the joint distribution solves  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c l}{\\displaystyle}&{\\displaystyle=-\\partial_{x}[\\mu(x,z)g(x,z,\\eta,j)]+\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{x x}\\big[\\sigma^{2}(x,z)g(x,z,\\eta,j)\\big]-(\\delta_{s}+\\delta_{d})g(x,z,\\eta,j)}\\ &{\\displaystyle\\quad-\\sum_{z^{\\prime}\\neq z}\\alpha\\lambda(z^{\\prime})g(x,z,\\eta,j)-\\sum_{k\\neq j}\\pi_{j\\to k}\\sum_{i=1}^{M_{k}}\\alpha\\lambda(z_{i k})g(x,z,\\eta,j),\\quad x>\\underline{{x}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe joint distribution changes because of skill accumulation and worker turnovers. Because workers reset their skills after switching employers, whenever $x>\\underline{{x}}(z),$ there is no inflow of workers due to turnover.  \n\nAt $x=\\underline{{x}}(z),$ two cases occur. The first case relates to employed workers switching employers, corresponding to $\\eta>0$ . There is inflow of workers from other employers that are poached away by firm $z$ in sector $j$ . The second case corresponds to unemployed workers finding jobs, i.e. $\\eta=0$  \n\nA stationary equilibrium is defined as a collection of value functions $\\{S,U,W\\},$ a collection of job-finding rates $\\{\\lambda(z)\\}$ and switching probabilities $\\{\\pi_{j\\to k}\\}$ , and the joint distribution $\\{g(x,z,j,\\eta)\\}$ such that Equations (B.3) to (B.6) are satisfied, together with Equation (B.8). We will regulate the job-finding rates and the switching probabilities directly by data instead of using equilibrium equations such as the free-entry condition.  \n\nThis simplifies computation without affecting our purpose: we can easily impose the free-entry condition by adding costs of switching and vacancy postings, in which case the job-finding rates and the switching probabilities will be determined by those switching costs. However, since we are not interested in how changes in switching costs affect the equilibrium turnover rate and wages, we directly specify the job-finding rates and  \n\nswitching probabilities.  \n\n### B.4 Model Estimation  \n\nWe estimate the model using simulated method of moments. We include 13 industry groups based on 2-digit NAICS industry code, given in Table B.1. For each industry group, there are four levels of productivity, normalized to be $\\{0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8\\}$ . We calculate the productivity distribution of industry vacancy postings using the wages in the BGT vacancy postings, with the wage intervals being $\\$0–\\$30000$ $\\$30001–\\$600000$ $\\$60001–\\$1000000$ ${>}\\$1000000$  \n\nTable B.1: Industry Groups   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\">NAICS Two-Digit Industry Code</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>48&49</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>51</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>31&33</td><td>52&53</td><td>71&72&81</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>54</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>44& 45</td><td>55</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWe set the discount rate $\\rho$ to be 0.002, corresponding to a risk-free rate of $2\\%$ per annum. We calculate the separation rate using CPS from 2010 to 2019, which is equal to 0.028. The labor market exit rate is 0.0028, implying a working life of 30 years.  \n\nWe parameterize the drift of the firm-specific human capital to be  \n\n$$\n\\mu(x,z)=\\zeta\\operatorname*{max}\\left\\{z-x,0\\right\\}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\zeta$ is the skill growth rate if the worker's human capital is below the firm's productivity $z$ . Namely, the worker's firm-specific human capital evolves towards the firm's productivity. The volatility of the human capital growth is set to be a constant $\\sigma_{x}$ . We set the moment targets for $\\zeta$ and $\\sigma_{x}$ to be the mean wage growth and the standard deviation of wage growth.  \n\nThe production function has the following form:  \n\n$$\ny(x,z,j)=p_{j}-\\gamma_{1}\\operatorname*{max}\\left\\{z-x,0\\right\\}^{2}+\\gamma_{2}z x\n$$  \n\n$p_{j}$ is industry-specific productivity. Workers with lower human capital have lower productivities, with the penalty parameter given by $\\gamma_{1}$ . High productivity firms and Workers with high human capital are complementary if $\\gamma_{2}>0$ Wecompute $\\left\\{p_{j}\\right\\}$ using the residual wage by industry. For $\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{2}$ We target the mean and the standard deviation of the wage.  \n\nWithin each industry, the job-finding rate is calculated using CPS from 2010 to 2019. The industry flow matrix is constructed using Footnote 9, where we normalize each row to sum to 1. Denote this matrix $\\left\\{\\pi_{j,k}\\right\\}$ . For unemployed workers in industry $j,$ the probability of finding a job in industry $k$ is hence $\\pi_{j,k}\\lambda_{j},$ where $\\lambda_{j}$ is the job-finding rate for industry $j$ For employed workers, the on-the-job-search efficiency is $\\alpha$ which is calibrated to match the average turnover rate.  \n\nWe specify the initial human capital to be a fraction of the firm productivity $x(z)=\\chi z,$ and we set the fraction to match the short-duration employment incidence rate. We estimate the unemployment benefit $b$ to target the average wage markdown. The corresponding parameter values are in Table B.2.  \n\nTable B.2: Parameter Values   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter</td><td>Value</td><td>Parameter</td><td>Value</td></tr><tr><td>/1</td><td>4.45</td><td>b</td><td>0.48</td></tr><tr><td>/2</td><td>1.17</td><td></td><td>0.61</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>0.54</td><td>2</td><td>0.024</td></tr><tr><td>Ox</td><td>0.29</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nBesides the targeted moments, our model matches well the unemployment rate $(5.8\\%)$ and the industry employment share.  \n\n### B.5 A Shock to Employer Concentration  \n\nWe impose a shock to the employer concentration so that the turnover rate declines by $5\\%$ Specifically, for each industry, we redistribute the vacancies to the firm with the largest measure of vacancies by decreasing the vacancy shares of other firms evenly. The $5\\%$ decline in the turnover rate is associated with a $1.1\\%$ decline in wages. Because Schubert et al. (2021) estimate that the employer concentration shock would decrease realized wages by $3\\%$ , we calculate that $40\\%$ of the decline is accounted for through the turnover channel.  \n\n### B.6 Industry-Specific Minimum Wages  \n\nTwo observations motivate our policy analysis of industry-specific minimum wages. First, the effects of employer concentration on the turnover rate and wages are heterogeneous by industry. Second, Liu (2022b) show that a uniform minimum wage would disincentivize mobility by compressing wages.  \n\nWe hence consider setting minimum wages such that the lower-bounds on the workers' share of surplus Equation (B.2) need to implement the value of the least productive firms in each sector, where the dispersion comes from industry-specific productivity. This policy would increase workers' bargaining power without affecting employment, because the least productive firms are now indifferent between operating and exit the labor market.  \n\nWe repeat the employer concentration shock as above, where the effect on the turnover rate decrease to $2\\%$ while the effect on wages decrease to $0.2\\%$ . This is because of an overall improvement in workers' outside option which offsets the effects of employer concentration.  "

We survey existing competition enforcement in labour markets and the empirical evidence on the extent and impact of labour market power, with a particular focus on the UK. We find that in contrast to the US, labour market power in the UK has not risen substantially. Nonetheless, workers vary in their exposure and, for some, labour market power has significant economic costs. Labour market power also appears to interact in significant ways with other labour market policies. We argue these findings underscore the danger of making policy decisions based on evidence from other countries, or by analogy with product markets. We survey what these findings mean for existing tools available to competition agencies and conclude by laying out four types of open questions: theoretical, empirical, legal, and normative.  \n\nKeywords: labour market power, labour market concentration, competition policy. JEL codes: D43, J31, J42, L40  \n\n## Introduction  \n\nLabour market power refers to an imbalance between the relative bargaining strength of frms and workers, resulting in wages that differ from the marginal product of labour.1 While competition agencies have traditionally focused on product market power, labour market power is a growing part of the debate. Recent advances in the literature have highlighted rising labour market power across the economy and the effect of labour market concentration on worker outcomes. At the same time, competition authorities have also increasingly used their existing toolbox to combat wage fixing, a form of price fixing in labour markets. The new US Horizontal Merger Guidelines (US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, 2023) make it clear that US agencies may block mergers on labour market grounds alone.  \n\nThere are three ways to think about labour markets and market power from a competition perspective. Competition authorities may be interested in the effect of product market power on labour market outcomes, as in Nickell et al. (1994) or Montag (2023). They may be interested in the impacts of labour market power on labour market outcomes, as in Prager and Schmitt (2021). Finally, they may be interested in the impact of labour market power on consumer outcomes, as in Berger et al. (2022). This paper focuses on the latter two cases (where market power arises in labour markets) and only briefly touches on the impact of product market power on labour market outcomes.  \n\nTypicallyrinlaurmarkt pes takntmean hift n pwe twardm, withwk ang sthanthrmarl )roduct. The rest of our discussion follows this convention.  \n\nTable 1 summarizes these three options for reference. The final quadrant in the table deals with product market power's impact on consumer outcomes. This is traditionally the more standard domain of competition enforcement. There are many ways in which firms may exert labour market power over workers. They may impose contractual clauses, suppress pay, or offer poor working conditions. But why does this imbalance in power exist? If workers cannot seamlessly move between jobs, they cannot respond to a marginally better employment option becoming available, or a worsening in the conditions of their current job.  \n\nThis may occur due to job search frictions (not knowing all options that are available, as in Pissarides, 2011; Bhuller et al., 2023), mobility frictions (an inability to move across occupations or geographies, as in Redding and Rossi-Hansberg, 2017; Heise and Porzio, 2021), contractual limitations (preventing a switch to a competitor, as in Starr et al., 2019), or simply a lack of alternatives (perhaps there is a single local employer due to barriers to entry, maybe due to job differentiation', as in Azar et al., 2022a). When employees face limited outside options in the labour market, frms with market power face upward-sloping labour supply functions, instead of the infinitely elastic labour supply that would prevail in the mythical perfectly competitive labour market.  \n\nIn this article, we survey how competition agencies have approached labour market power to date, what the latest empirical evidence tells us, and finish with some open questions for further research. We argue that, while certain types of labour market power are straightforwardly addressed with existing tools, others present unknown and often significant trade-offs for competition agencies.  \n\nWe summarize new empirical evidence to inform these trade-offs for the UK from a recent report by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA, 2024). Across a variety of data sources and methodologies, labour market power in the UK does not seem to have increased in recent decades, in contrast to US trends. This underscores the importance of country-specific evidence.  \n\nHowever, labour market power does not affect all labour markets and workers equally. Some markets are highly concentrated and, for workers in them, there are real costs to pay. Labour market power also interacts with, and is influenced by, other labour market policies and factors, from minimum wage policies to the prevailing employment law. This has two implications: first, analogies from product markets do not always carry over very well. Second, other policy-makers besides competition agencies may have access to better (or at least complementary) tools.  \n\nWe conclude with a series of open questions for researchers working on labour market power. These questions fall into four categories: theoretical, empirical, legal, and normative. Progress in these areas would enable a better understanding of the options and trade-offs competition agencies face with respect to labour market power.  \n\nThe rest of the article is structured as follows. Section I outlines what actions competition agencies worldwide have recently taken in this space. Section II summarizes the state of our knowledge on labour market power, with particular attention to the UK. Section Ill reviews the evidence on worker and wider outcomes. Section IV takes stock of what these trends mean for policy-makers, and a final section V lays out the important questions that remain unanswered.  \n\n### I. Competition enforcement in labour markets: tools and recent activity  \n\nCompetition policy enforcement with respect to labour market power currently broadly falls into three categories: respectively, the treatment of illegal practices such as wage fixing and no-poach agreements, guidance for firms (for instance, on solo self-employed workers and restrictive covenants), and, for a few agencies, labour market theories of harm in merger cases.  \n\nFigure 1, based on the authors’ calculations, summarizes enforcement activities in this area. Three points stand out. First, the total number of enforcement actions with a labour market element has increased sixfold in the past 10 years. Second, wage-fixing and no-poach cases have accounted for most enforcement work in this area. Third, US competition authorities have been responsible for the largest share of cases to date.  \n\nTable 1: Market power and harm in different domains   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Consumerharm</td><td>Workerharm</td></tr><tr><td>Productmarketpower</td><td>\"Classical’ competition enforcement</td><td>Out of scope for this article</td></tr><tr><td>Labourmarketpower</td><td>In scope for this article</td><td>In scope for this article</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Conceptual table, authors’ own calculations.  \n\n![](images/ffb627738fe48575d3b8d439d4ab2d5de5b44c1cd62386fae5cb3309d4a04bbc.jpg)  \nFigure 1: Labour market competition cases have been rising in prominence since 2010 Notes: Counts of competition cases with labour markets component, 2010-24. Source: Authors' own calculations based on publicly available information.  \n\nLike price fixing and market sharing, wage fixing and no poach agreements are illegal in many jurisdictions, allowing competition agencies to sidestep the question of who is harmed by the action. Perhaps as a result, interventions on wage fixing or no-poach grounds have been the most common labour market competition interventions to date. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has recently investigated wage fixing or no-poach agreements in home healthcare, aerospace engineering,3 rail equipment,4 and software engineering, among others.  \n\nOther competition agencies have also been active in this area. The Dutch competition authority has recently investigated supermarkets for wage fixing,6 and previously investigated hospitals for no-poach agreements.7 The Portuguese competition authority has recently investigated football teams\\* and Covid-19 test providers for no-poach agreements, and land surveyors for wage fixing.10 The Spanish competition authority has recently investigated independent schoolsl1 for no-poaching and previously investigated hairdressing product manufacturers12 and freight forwarders13 for information exchange and wage fixing. Table 2 in the Appendix provides a more exhaustive list of recent competition cases in labour markets around the world. US competition agencies have also led the way beyond wage fixing and no-poach agreements. In April 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a nationwide ban on non-competes, contractual clauses which limit workers? ability to switch jobs or start a rival company. The ban has been framed as a pro-competitive intervention, designed to boost innovation, start-up entry, and wages, given the estimates of widespread non-compete prevalence acrosstheUs.14  \n\nBeyond the non-competes ban, action in this space has predominantly taken the form of guidance for firms. The EU, for instance, has published guidelines15 which carve out an exemption from Article 101 for collective bargaining agreements of solo self-employed workers that are like employees. Similar guidelines have been issued by the Australian16 and Dutch17 competition authorities. More broadly, the Lithuanian,18 Portuguese,19 and $\\mathrm{UK}^{20}$ competition authorities have issued guidance to firms on what policies may be deemed anticompetitive in a labour markets context, while the Nordic competition agencies have published a report summarizing their joint view on theissue.21  \n\nTable 2: Recent competition agency actions on labour markets   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Country</td><td>Year</td><td>Area</td><td>Type</td><td>Source</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td></td><td>Collective bargaining</td><td>G</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>2023</td><td>General labour markets</td><td>G</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>China</td><td>2022</td><td>Driving schools</td><td>NP, WF</td><td>Media coverage</td></tr><tr><td>Colombia</td><td>2021</td><td>Football</td><td>NP</td><td>Media coverage</td></tr><tr><td>Croatia</td><td>2015</td><td>IT</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>European Union</td><td>2022</td><td>Solo self-employed workers</td><td>G</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>2017</td><td>Floor coverings</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>2022</td><td>Lift installation services</td><td>WF</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Hungary</td><td>2020</td><td>HR consulting</td><td>WF, NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Lithuania</td><td>2023</td><td>General labour markets</td><td>G</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Lithuania</td><td>2022</td><td>Real estate agencies</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Lithuania</td><td>2022</td><td>Basketball</td><td>WF</td><td>Media coverage</td></tr><tr><td>Mexico</td><td>2021</td><td>Football</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>2023</td><td>Solo self-employed workers</td><td>G</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>2021</td><td>Supermarkets</td><td>WF</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>2010</td><td>Hospitals</td><td>NP</td><td>Court ruling</td></tr><tr><td>Poland</td><td>2023</td><td>Automobile association</td><td>WF</td><td>Media coverage</td></tr><tr><td>Poland</td><td>2022</td><td>Basketball</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>2022</td><td>Football</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>2022</td><td>Covid-19 testing</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>2021</td><td>Land surveyors</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>2021</td><td>General labour markets</td><td>G</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Romania</td><td>2022</td><td>Automotive engineering</td><td>WF, NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Romania</td><td>2018</td><td>Notaries</td><td>WF</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>2022</td><td>Schools</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>2012</td><td>Hairdressing products</td><td>IE, NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>2010</td><td>Freight forwarding</td><td>IE, NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>2022</td><td>Banking</td><td>IE</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>Turkiye</td><td>2019</td><td>Gym franchises</td><td>NC, NP</td><td>Media coverage</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>2023</td><td>General labour markets</td><td>G</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>2023</td><td>Fragrance production</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>2023</td><td>Television content</td><td>WF</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>2022</td><td>Sports content</td><td>WF</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2024</td><td>Supermarkets</td><td>M</td><td>Media coverage</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2023</td><td>Aerospace executives</td><td>NP</td><td>Media coverage</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2022</td><td>Gig economy</td><td>G</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2022</td><td>Publishing</td><td>M</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2022</td><td>Home healthcare</td><td>WF, NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2022</td><td>Healthcare (Colorado)</td><td>NP</td><td>Media coverage</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2021</td><td>Healthcare (Nevada)</td><td>NP, WF</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2020</td><td>Healthcare (Texas)</td><td>WF</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2018</td><td>Rail equipment</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2016</td><td>General labour markets</td><td>G</td><td>Announcement</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>2011</td><td>Software engineering</td><td>NP</td><td>Announcement</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: $\\mathrm{G}=$ guidance;

In practice, US agencies have pursued three merger cases at least in part due to labour market concerns: the 2022 proposed takeover of publishing house Simon & Schuster by rival Penguin Random House22 and, more recently, the 2024 merger between supermarket chains Albertsons and Kroger23 and Tapestry's attempted acquisition of Capri, with implications in the luxury handbag market.24  \n\nThere are also many examples of recent policy-maker interest in encouraging, raising, or preserving competition in labour markets beyond competition agencies. In 2021, the White House affrmed its commitment with an executive order ‘to enforce the antitrust laws to combat the excessive concentration of industry, the abuses of market power, and the harmful effects of monopoly and monopsony—-especially as these issues arise in labor markets'.25s  \n\nThis new prominence of labour market concerns reflcts the growing intellectual influence of the wider New Brandeis antitrust movement that has shifted thinking within US institutions such as the FTC and the DoJ, and in other countries. Neo-Brandeisians propose a wider focus for antitrust to promote competition beyond consumer welfare, to include welfare of individuals as citizens and workers.  \n\nWhile a wider assessment of neo-Brandeisian antitrust in areas beyond labour markets is beyond the scope of this paper, we note the existence of a burgeoning research agenda taking a wider lens on competition economics to include these potential effects beyond consumer surplus (Cowgill et al., 2021; Deb et al., 2022; Berger et al., 2022).  \n\n### Il. How pervasive, and how damaging, is labour market power?  \n\nEvidence of rising market power in output markets has provoked renewed concern that such trends may also be present in the labour market. In some ways, analysis of labour market power is analogous to that in output markets. Welfare analysis in a simple monopsony model is effectively a mirror image of the monopoly case. Yet there are some key differences, not least of all that labour markets are two-sided matching markets, involving search, contracts, heterogeneity of many forms, and bargaining.  \n\nThere is mounting evidence that wage markdowns (an estimate of the difference between the revenue contribution and the wage of the marginal worker in each firm) in the US over the last 20-25 years have risen steeply (Khan and Metaxoglou, 2021; Yeh et al., 2022; Kirov and Traina, 2023). This suggests that workers are taking home a smaller share of their marginal revenue product of labour in the US.26  \n\nThis literature also sheds light on which frms can extract a greater share of worker surplus. There is some evidence that bigger firms may set higher markdowns, despite the well-documented large-firm wage premium (Amodio et al., 2022; Yeh et al., 2022). Larger firms are generally more productive, so could on average pay higher wages and yet still reduce the share of their marginal product that workers earn. However, Kirov and Traina (2023) do not find that this positive relationship between markdowns and frm size holds across a sample of US manufacturing firms.  \n\nResearchers also study labour market concentration as a proxy for labour market power. US employer concentration declined sharply in the early 1980s but has since steadily climbed back to the level of the late 1970s (Rinz, 2022; Yeh et al., 2022). These results hold at the national level, but there is some debate about both the results and interpretation (Lipsius, 2018; Eeckhout, 2020). For one thing, while concentration is a reasonable proxy for market power in some popular models of competition such as Cournot, that is not always the case (Syverson, 2019; Eeckhout, 2020). Furthermore, we may observe diverging trends in local and national concentration simply due to demographic changes (Eeckhout, 2020). In fact, Rinz (2022) finds such divergence between local and national concentration trends for US labour markets, and Rossi-Hansberg et al. (2021) for US product markets. The authors argue that large firms like Walmart have entered many local markets, which lowers local concentration but raises national concentration. Finally, it is important to be clear whether measures of national labour market concentration measure that faced by the average worker, or the concentration in the average labour market.  \n\nThere is strong evidence that higher labour market concentration is negatively correlated with wages across many countries (Azar et al., 2020; Marinescu et al., 2021; Azar et al., $2022b$ ; Bassanini et al., 2023; Handwerker and Dey, 2024; Thoresson, 2024). However, a causal relationship is tricky to show definitively, as other factors like the distribution of frm productivity could drive both labour market concentration and average wages in a local labourmarket.  \n\nLabour market power has three potential effects: it may suppress wages, raise prices, and introduce aggregate inefficiency. Firms with market power in the labour market can lower wages below the revenue provided by an additional worker. In an oligopsony framework, frms achieve this by reducing labour demand, moving down their upwards-sloping labour supply curve, therefore reducing labour input and producing less output. This lower output is associated with higher prices, as long as demand for a firm's output is not perfectly elastic.  \n\nLabour market power is an additional wedge (alongside, for example, product market power or adjustment costs), which introduces inefficiency away from the theoretical allocative benchmark. It reduces firm size and the number of firms in many settings, leading to less intense competition (e.g. Deb et al., 2022). The impact is heterogeneous—more productive firms may have larger markdowns (e.g. Berger et al., 2022), leading to misallocation across firms. Labour market power thus slows down the competitive process across the economy.  \n\nIn a recently published report (CMA, 2024), the CMA used a variety of data sources and approaches to measure labour market power in the UK. The report centred on four key empirical findings. First, UK wage markdowns have been constant or slightly falling since 2008. Second, labour market concentration steadily declined from 2002 before rising briefly and sharply in the pandemic. Third, other labour market institutions also matter for labour market power. For instance, restrictive covenants are common across industries and throughout the income distribution and likely affect worker mobility. Fourth, individual earnings are negatively related to employer concentration, though this relationship disappears in the presence of collective bargaining agreements.  \n\nWage markdowns are equivalent to price markups but describe market power in labour markets rather than output markets. Markdowns tell us how much the average worker earns out of their marginal contribution to a firm's sales. Formally, they are defined as the ratio of the marginal revenue of labour to the marginal cost of labour (that is, the wage). Measuring the marginal revenue of labour is difficult, so the CMA report follows an established literature (Dobbelaere and Mairesse, 2013; Morlacco, 2019; Yeh et al., 2022), which estimates market power in product markets using two distinct inputs (labour and intermediate inputs) and takes the ratio of these two to back-out the market power in the labour market. This approach assumes that the market for intermediate inputs is competitive, though this assumption is controversial. As we show later in this article, joint market power in labour and input markets further complicates the picture.  \n\nA nice feature of markdowns is that they provide a summary measure of the balance of power between workers and frms. Many factors may affect the markdown, from workers’ outside options, to collective bargaining, occupational licensing, and unemployment benefits. The markdown therefore summarizes information on many features of the labour market, such as tightness and regulation, and reflects the two-sided nature of labour markets.  \n\nFigure 2 shows the evolution of the average wage markdown for the UK market economy. Wage markdowns increased slightly from 2008 to 2010, then decreased again. Overall, they have decreased slightly over the last 15 years. The levels in the chart have been standardized to make comparison of the trends easier.  \n\nFigure 2 suggests that workers are taking home a larger share of their contribution to their employer's sales. The level of the markdown depends on the methods employed, but the report finds that employers capture between 15 and 45 per cent of the marginal contribution of workers. Of course, other labour market frictions or aspects of the employment relationship (such as which party carries the risk) will also influence the wage markdown.  \n\nThe CMA report also estimates labour market concentration, as measured by the employment Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHI). The employment HHI is defined as the sum of squared employment shares within a labour market. Labour markets are defined at the Travel to Work Area (TTWA) by 3-digit Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). The former are produced by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) based on census commuting data, with criteria chosen specifically to delineate the geographical area corresponding to most workers\\* likely commuting patterns.27  \n\n![](images/27ff8190135385e9756957ebc4f5a6f45e9c99d6bd251fd1eed5199c15b42fa5.jpg)  \nFigure 2: Labour market power measured via wage markdowns is constant or declining in GB Notes:Whole-economymean markdown series from a variety of production function estimation approaches $100=2008$ values), from the Annua Business Survey,GB,2008-2021. Source:CMA(2024).  \n\nTo define labour markets, the report interacts this geographical measure with narrow occupation definitions to reflect the consensus in the literature (Azar et al., 2022a; Azar et al., 2022b). Alternative definitions of labour markets (for instance, defining labour markets along industry as well as geographical lines) produce identical trends, both in aggregate and across various slices of the data.28  \n\nMedian and mean labour market concentration in GB are roughly the same today as 20 years ago. Figure 3 shows that the mean labour market concentration as measured by the HHI fell from over 1,200 in 2002 to almost 900 prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, before rising towards 1,100 in 2022. To put this in context, an HHI of 1,100 corresponds to roughly nine equally sized employers in each labour market. In product markets, competition agencies typically call markets with HHIs above 1,500 ^moderately concentrated', and those with HHIs above 2,500 ^concentrated'. The median concentration followed a similar trend, dropping from 650 in 2002 to below 500, before rebounding to 600 in 2022.  \n\nFigure 4 maps out average labour market concentration across the UK using employment data. The darker an area, the more concentrated on average its labour markets are. While labour markets in London and the South East show low levels of concentration, labour markets are much more concentrated in Scotland, Wales, and the South West. The overall picture is strikingly similar when we map labour market concentration with vacancy data (CMA, 2024).29  \n\nWhile there are differences in labour market concentration on average across labour markets, the trends over time have been remarkably similar across regions. Most areas experienced employer concentration trending close to the average in Great Britain from 2002 to 2022, with only London and Scotland showing notably different trends. London saw a steady decline in concentration, with less of an uptick during the pandemic. Scotland's labour markets went in the other direction, with a gradual rise in concentration over this period.  \n\n![](images/6043f70912d8fdbd3745b1c2eaccd8723458785450646fa5b84315d203da92b3.jpg)  \nData from Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), 2002 - 2022.   \nFigure 3: Labour market concentration in GB has been steady or declining over the past 20 years Notes: Whole-economy mean and median labour market HHI for Great Britain at the 3-digit SOC by TTWA, from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE),GB,2002-22. Sorce:CM(20241  \n\nAside from overall concentration, other features of the labour market also affect labour market power. Here, we highlight two aspects that have attracted the interest of competition agencies: solo self-employed workers (often referred to as 'gig’ workers in the context of digital labour platforms) and the use of restrictive covenants (that is employment contract clauses that restrict the mobility of workers).  \n\nSolo self-employed workers have been a focus for competition authorities since in a legal sense they are undertakings transacting with other undertakings (whether via a platform or otherwise), but from an economic point of view may be closer to workers transacting with an employer. While the former is usually a case for competition law enforcement, the latter in many countries would fall under employment laws instead. Restrictive covenants similarly are typically a matter of employment law, but might nonetheless have implications for how businesses compete, by making it harder for some companies to hire the right employees.  \n\nThe report uses individual-level survey data to measure the prevalence of gig workers in the UK economy. Gig workers are defined as anyone who sells their labour services via digital platforms. This is a narrower definition than wider casual or temporary work. Figure 5 shows that a small but growing part of the UK economy is in gig work. About 4 per cent of workers are gig workers, compared to closer to 10-12 per cent in wider temporary and casual work.  \n\nGig workers often work acros multiple jobs, within and outside the gig economy, and tend to combine gig earnings with other sources of income. The fraction of gig workers who work multiple jobs has been increasing over time. The increasing number of gig workers competing for tasks from a small number of platforms suggests that gig workers may not have much bargaining power relative to their employers, but more evidence is needed on this point.  \n\nThe extent to which gig workers are caught by competition law rules against coordination is a live issue in competition policy. The economic substance of the labour relationship matters here, not necessarily the precise contractual arrangements or the employment law position. For example, in September 2022, the European Commission adopted guidelines30 which clarify that EU competition law does not apply to solo self-employed people that are in a situation comparable to workers. These include those who provide services exclusively or predominantly to one undertaking; work side-by-side with workers; and provide services to or through a digital labour platform. The European Commission further clarified that it will not enforce EU competition rules against collective agreements made by solo self-employed individuals who are in a weak negotiating position against economically stronger companies. Therefore, the guidelines recognize that it is the balance of power between firms and workers that matters for wage outcomes.  \n\n![](images/b664e7178bec68a151544e342c0de36230e590bd1ef2359c7a5106e4aeb1fe0e.jpg)  \nFigure 4: There are big geographical differences in labour market concentration Notes: Mean labour market HHI at the three-digit SOC by TTWA level, for Great Britain from ASHE, 2002-22, aggregated to NUTS3 (panel 1) and for the UK from Lightcast job vacancy data, 2012-22 (panel 2). Source:CMA(2024).  \n\nThe ability of workers to move to new employment opportunities also gives them a degree of countervailing la. bour market power. Restrictive covenants are employment contract clauses that limit what employes can do while at their current employer, or after leaving their employment. As a result, these contract clauses may restrict worke mobility and hence increase labour market power.  \n\n![](images/c58f1a76e4292b34b0d6eb7eb71fe43f9819cdd6311af3b22edef446789b9347.jpg)  \nFigure 5: A rising percentage of UK workers work in the gig economy (up to 5 per cent since the pandemic) Notes: Gig workers and casual workers as a share of total employment, from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, UK, 2019-22. Source:CMA(2024).  \n\nExamples of restrictive covenants are non-compete agreements (which limit which firms an employee can join, or whether they can start a competing firm of their own), confidentiality agreements (which limit what information an employee can share with others, also known as non-disclosure agreements), and non-solicitation agreements (which limit whether employees can approach co-workers or clients after leaving their current employer).  \n\nFigure 6 plots firms? self-reported use of restrictive covenants. Confidentiality agreements are by far the most common form of restrictive covenant, at about 14 per cent, but non-compete agreements, non-solicitation agreements, no-recruitment of co-worker agreements, and even no-poach agreements between firms (which are illegal in the UK) are in use by some firms. A sizeable minority of frms use multiple agreements at the same time.  \n\nFigure 7, based on a different, employee-based dataset, shows that non-compete agreements are particularly common in information and communication technologies and professional and scientific services where they cover 40 per cent of workers. However, even in retail, food services, and education, about 20 per cent of workers have a non-compete clause in their contract. Studies for the US (Starr et al., 2021) and Western Europe (Boeri et al., 2023) find similar rates of prevalence.  \n\nFor non-compete agreements, additional evidence from the employee side can help us understand their use better. Employee responses provide a broadly similar picture, though reported use of non-compete agreements is generally higher. In a CMA-commissioned LSE-YouGov survey, roughly 26 per cent of employees believe they have a noncompete clause in their employment contract, with a further 23 per cent unsure.  \n\nFirms might use restrictive covenants for benign reasons. A firm might be more likely to invest in training for its employees (especially for skills that are useful at other firms, too) if employees could not then take these skills immediately to a competitor. Equally, firms might be more willing to share confidential client relationships with employees if those employees were prevented from poaching these clients in the future. Both investment in general human capital and client relationships may make employees more productive and therefore increase their earnings.  \n\nThe CMA report, indeed, finds that the share of workers receiving formal training (though not other types of training) is about 10 percentage points higher for workers with non-compete agreements, around 50 per cent compared to a baseline of just under 40 per cent for those without.  \n\n![](images/bd4a928459d3085c9747400e91a4c279f320ec176ed94a4c107bae3829921d31.jpg)  \nData from Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS), Wave 87 (July 2023)  \n\n![](images/2431c91c542f53897d1cc331a0968a111fcab732a571aeeede648fbd8ef67b18.jpg)  \nFigure 6: Employment clauses limiting the mobility of workers are common in the UK Notes: Proportion of firms that report using restrictive covenants, from the Business Insights and Conditions Survey, UK, 2023.

Evidence from US state-level variation in legal rules (Johnson et al., 2023), from a ban on non-competes for low-wage workers in Oregon (Lipsitz and Starr, 2021) and a legislative change in California (Kang and Fleming, 2020) suggests that non-competes are indeed associated with less worker mobility and lower wages, and a shift in economic activity away from startups and towards incumbent frms. To the extent that they prevent reallocation towards startups, we may be concerned that non-competes therefore slow down the introduction of new ideas and processes into the economy. The CMA report found that many workers reported they had passed on an opportunity at a competitor or refrained from starting their own business because of their non-compete.  \n\n### Ill. What does labour market power mean for workers and the economy?  \n\nCompetition authorities are increasingly concerned with labour market power. Implicit in this concern is the assumption that workers, consumers, and the wider economy are harmed by it. This section shows that the evidence strongly suggests that worker outcomes are worse under labour market power. More widely, falling business dynamism and labour reallocation rates are at least consistent with rising aggregate labour market frictions. However, empirical evidence on the impact of labour market power on consumers is still thin on the ground.  \n\nThe link between labour market concentration and worker outcomes is well-established. Theoretically, firms use labour market power by reducing the labour they hire (in a monopsony model; Manning, 2021) or exploiting search frictions (Manning, 2011; Gottfries and Jarosch, 2023). Both channels allow them to lower the wage offered toworkers.  \n\nConsistent with the theory, a large literature finds that concentration lowers workers’ wages. Most of this evidence is focused on the Us (for instance, Azar et al., 2020; Azar et al., $2022b$ ; Benmelech et al., 2022; Rinz, 2022; Handwerker and Dey, 2024). Abel et al. (2018) show a similar relationship holds for the UK. This literature is often criticized as not measuring the causal effect of concentration on wages since concentration and wages are both determined at the same time by decisions of workers and firms.  \n\nThe CMA report follows this literature, while noting the concerns about causality. It estimates worker-level wage-concentration regressions, with labour markets defined as the intersection of TTWA and 3-digit SOC. Linking employee data to employer data allows for a rich set of controls, although the report falls short of dealing with causality concerns in a systematic way (for instance, in the spirit of Azar et al., 2022a).  \n\nThe report finds that UK wages and labour market concentration are negatively correlated: the higher labour market concentration, the lower worker wages are on average. This relationship is robust to the inclusion of worker, firm, region, and time-specific controls. Figure 8 shows the relationship between wages and labour market concentration after removing the influence of these other variables: this allows us to compare workers on a more like-for-like basis. To reduce statistical noise, observations have been grouped into bins? based on the degree of concentration, and bin averages plotted instead.  \n\nThe relationship between wages and concentration is negative, statistically significant, and stable across different sets of control variables. While labour market concentration has not increased overall, in concentrated labour markets wages of comparable workers are lower than in less concentrated labour markets.  \n\nThe magnitude of the wage-concentration relationship is also economically significant. On average, and holding other worker, frm, and labour market characteristics constant, going from the bottom quartile to the top quartile of concentration is associated with 2 per cent lower wages. For a move from the bottom decile to the top decile wages are on average 4 per cent lower. However, as discussed below, there is some evidence that the magnitude of this effect has declined over time.  \n\nWhen labour market power on the employer side is balanced by market power on the employee side, this negative relationship disappears. For a worker covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the negative association between wages and labour market concentration becomes quantitatively small and statistically insignificant.31  \n\nFinally, when estimating the wage-concentration relationship on a year-by-year basis, the report finds that the wage penalty has been decreasing over the last two decades for the UK. Figure 9 shows that while the elasticity of the wage with respect to concentration stood at $-0.04$ in 2002, in 2021 it had fallen to $-0.01$ andbecomestatistically indistinguishable from zero.  \n\nLabour market concentration might also be related to other labour market outcomes, such as the number of hours worked, the unemployment rate, and the rate at which workers change jobs and employers. When workers have fewer outside options, they might, for instance, not be able to work as many hours as they would like.

Source:CMA(2024).  \n\nrecent CMA report can again provide some tentative evidence. Figure 10 plots our coefficients for the elasticity of hours worked with respect to labour market concentration, for increasing sets of controls. The report finds an elasticityof about $-0.004$ for our baseline regression. This is consistent with a monopsony explanation of labour market power: to reduce wages, employers demand less labour. As a result, both equilibrium wages and hours are lower than they would be if the labour market were competitive.  \n\nLabour market concentration and labour market institutions also interact in complex ways. For instance, labour market power may change the standard logic regarding negative labour supply effects of minimum wage policies. The argument goes as follows: in imperfectly competitive labour markets, labour supply curves are upwardssloping, frms must raise wages to hire more workers. They will hire up to the point that the marginal cost (the wage) equals the revenue provided by the marginal worker. Firms will pay below the marginal product of labour by restricting labour demand to maximize profits. However, a minimum wage creates a flat labour supply curve which kinks upwards only when the original supply curve is above the wage floor. This flat labour supply curve disincentivizes firms from under-hiring as they cannot benefit from lowering wages by hiring less. In this framework, a minimum wage can raise employment. Azar et al. (2023) argue that in concentrated US labour markets minimum wage policies may indeed increase employment. Similar results are found independently by Wiltshire et al.(2024).  \n\nThe CMA report finds comparable results for the UK. Workers who earn the National Minimum Wage work fewer hours and, similarly, workers in more concentrated labour markets work fewer hours. However, because the interaction term is positive, the joint effect is lower than the sum of the two: the National Minimum Wage therefore lowers hours worked less in more concentrated labour markets.  \n\nFigure 11 shows a scatterplot of the relationship between total employment and the share of workers covered by the National Minimum Wage after controlling for time and area fixed effects, and labour market characteristics. For both TTWAs with high (above-median) and low (below-median) labour market concentration, employment is negatively related to the National Minimum Wage “bite? (that is, how many individuals in each labour market are affected by the National Minimum Wage). However, this relationship is weaker in more concentrated labour markets.  \n\n![](images/57a8bfc5e664df18fd671b7e84bffaf0513b0d29b161de042422737eb69a1833.jpg)  \nFigure 11: In concentrated labour markets, minimum wages decrease employment by less Notes: Scatterplot of TTWA total employment against the share of individuals affected by the National Minimum Wage, by above- and belowmedian labour market concentration, from ASHE, Great Britain, 2014-21. Source:CMA(2024).  \n\nSince the relevant labour-market outcomes for this analysis are only observed at the TTWA level in the data the report uses, the analysis cannot control for individual worker characteristics. Therefore, additional caution needs to be taken in interpreting these results.  \n\nEvidence on the wider economic impact of labour market power is still in its infancy. An emerging literature at the intersection of industrial organization and macroeconomics has tried to quantify the welfare and productivity impacts of labour market power (De Loecker et al., 2021; Deb et al., 2022; Berger et al., 2022). These papers generally find sizeable aggregate impacts of labour market power, at least for the US.  \n\nThe evidence on consumer impacts is even thinner on the ground. We note, but sidestep entirely, the issue of labour market consequences of product market power. Recent work by Montag (2023) provides estimates of the trade-off this may create between consumer and worker interests in international mergers, using the example of the recent Maytag/Whirlpool merger.32 But more work clearly needs to be done.  \n\n### V. Why has UK labour market power fallen, and what does this mean for policy?  \n\nFor the UK, the CMA report shows that despite stable labour market concentration, UK wage markdowns and the wage-concentration penalty have both fallen in recent decades, suggesting that market power has shifted away from firms and towards workers. What can explain this shift in labour market power?  \n\nThe literature offers broadly three theories. First, it is possible that institutions that create countervailing worker power have risen in prominence, for instance if unions have gained strength or collective bargaining has become more widespread. This is essentially the reverse of what Farber et al. (2021) and Naidu (2022) argue has happened to the US over the twentieth century. Second, other labour market policies, such as the National Minimum Wage, could have strengthened the hand of workers. This would be consistent with findings about minimum wage increases elsewhere (Cengiz et al., 2019; Dube et al., 2022). Finally, general labour market conditions could have changed, shifting power towards workers (as argued for the US by Autor et al., 2023).  \n\nFigure 12 shows some tentative evidence on the likelihood of these three theories from the CMA report. Panel 1 plots trade union membership and collective bargaining coverage over the last two decades. As in other comparable countries (Farber et al., 2021), both have fallen slightly in recent decades. Panel 2 plots the incidence of the National Minimum Wage for low-concentration, medium-concentration, and high-concentration labour markets. The National Minimum Wage has indeed expanded significantly, but mostly in low- and medium-concentration labour markets. Finally, Panel 3 plots the UK's labour force participation ratio, a measure of general labour market tightness. Labour markets in the UK are tight by international comparison (OECD, 2022) and labour market tightness has increased further in the past two decades.  \n\nWhile more research is needed, together the three panels suggest that general labour market policies are the most likely factor behind the shift in UK labour market power from firms to workers. If true, this finding underscores that in labour markets (unlike in product markets) other policy institutions besides competition agencies may have more effective tools to address market power.  \n\n### V. Open questions for further research  \n\nThis paper has surveyed the recent increase in labour market-focused competition interventions and set out the current state of research on labour market power. As emphasized in the introduction, we have focused on the impact of labour market power on workers but have largely sidestepped the impact of labour market power on consumers, or product market power on worker outcomes.  \n\nImportant open questions remain, however. In this section, we highlight four important classes of questions: those related to our theoretical understanding of how labour market power operates; those related to the empirical ubiquity of certain practices, and the strength of their effects; those related to the legal toolbox to address competition issues in labour markets; and the normative questions inherent in the existing empirical trade-offs.  \n\nA frst set of questions is theoretical. Researchers have used monopsony, search, and bargaining based models to think about labour market power (Manning, 2011; Manning, 2021). Each may be useful for understanding aspects of imperfectly competitive labour markets but may also come with subtly different empirical predictions and welfare implications.  \n\nThe monopsony model for imperfectly competitive labour markets states that the monopsonist restricts how much labour it employs, allowing the firm to suppress wages to maximize profts. This is analogous to a monopolist reducing its output to raise prices above the otherwise ^competitive’ level. In a world where the firm has market power in both output and labour markets, the so-called 'monemporist' (Nichol, 1943) has dual incentives to shrink its input demand, putting downwards pressure on wages and lowering social welfare.33  \n\nIn contrast, in many search and bargaining models, labour market power does not necessarily impact the equilibrium quantity of labour, but merely shifts surplus from workers to frms. In a world described by those models, welfare concerns around labour market power are therefore primarily about workers, not consumers.  \n\nBeyond the basic model selection question, there are other theoretical questions that would benefit from further scrutiny. For instance, what is the static and dynamic impact of labour market power on consumer and aggregate welfare? What parameters does this depend on? And how does labour market power influence the incentives of firms that have it (and those that do not)? For instance, how might it influence innovation and directed technological change? Does it matter for (consumer) welfare?  \n\nEven with a suitable model identified, empirical questions need answering. These fall into two categories: first are descriptive statements of fact. How common is wage fixing? How common are no-poach agreements? Has the geography of labour markets changed with recent technological advances? Second are statements about causal relationships. What is the labour market impact of mergers? What is the impact of rising market power under rent-sharing? How restrictive are restrictive covenants? And how do non-competes affect innovation on balance?  \n\nFigure 13 ilustrates the importance of even the descriptive statements of facts across two panels: the first shows the correlation between industry-level product market power under the assumption that materials markets are more competitive than labour markets. The second shows the correlation for the opposite assumption. The correlation in Panel 1 is negative: industries with more market power in output markets have less market power in labour markets. In Panel 2, the correlation is positive: industries with more market power in output markets also have more market power in labour markets.  \n\n![](images/f2a6a5b64bb41dbf3162e1d42719ca67a29b45c9a4760ef687a3281ee2d6c4ef.jpg)  \nData from Labour Force Survey.  \n\n![](images/8bd927cb038d2c266561a046cd00dfbeb829304bd9e8e8fe9d088b558e13c703.jpg)  \nData from Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings(ASHE), 2002 - 2022.

Of course, in practice neither will be fully frictionless: while this paper has focused on labour market power, an emerging literature documents market power in input markets (Morlacco, 2019; Rubens, 2023; Hahn, 2023). Mechanically, the reason this assumption matters for the empirical findings is because it determines which input is used to compute price markups.  \n\nTheoretically, market power in output and labour markets need not be correlated: a firm may be a locally important employer but sell on a globally competitive product market. Conversely, a firm with product market power may be located in a dense labour market with many other opportunities for its employees. Some recent evidence even suggests that in some settings, where bargaining arrangements are strong, firms may share monopoly rents with workers (Treuren, 2022), consistent with a negative relationship between market power in labour and product markets.  \n\nFurther research is needed to answer which of these two identifying assumptions is more likely valid, and therefore whether labour market power and product market power are generally found in the same firms or not. If market power or other frictions are present in both input markets, both markup and markdown estimates may be affected.  \n\nOnce the theoretical and empirical connections are clear, this leaves the policy question of what tools competition agencies have at their disposal, and what tools they might need to effectively address labour market power.  \n\nAs this article sets out, existing actions in this area mostly take the form of investigations of wage fixing and no-poach agreements, collusive behaviour that in many jurisdictions is illegal, or the issuance of guidance. While Marinescu and Hovenkamp (2019) make the case that, in the US, there exists well-established legal doctrine to block mergers on input market grounds, this is not universally the case for other jurisdictions. What tools do competition agencies therefore have already, and what tools are needed to address labour market power?  \n\nIn some jurisdictions, other policy-makers may have better or at least complementary tools. In the UK, for instance, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Business and Trade, the Low Pay Commission, and HM Treasury all arguably set some policies that can affect labour market power.  \n\nFinally, even with complete clarity about these theoretical, empirical, and legal questions, some complex normative questions remain for further research. Among the questions labour market power raises are: should the interests of workers be considered where they conflict with the interests of consumers? How about workers and other input suppliers? Even where these conflicts are absent, how should competition agencies trade off the interests of different types of workers? Non-competes are particularly prevalent among high-income and white-collar employees (CMA, 2024). Given regulators limited resources, should they be prioritized over other forms of labour market power that perhaps are more widespread or disproportionately fall on low-income workers? In the background loom broader questions of democratic legitimacy and institutional design (Tinbergen, 1952; Dewatripont and Tirole, 1999; Tirole, 2023).  \n\nAfter a few quiet decades, both research and competition authorities? thinking on labour market power are evolving at a rapid pace. This presents the opportunity of addressing previously unaddressed harms, but also means that practice risks outrunning the current state of the evidence. We hope that the coming years bring further clarity on the four sets of open questions we outline in this paper.  \n\n## References  \n\nAbel, W., Tenreyro, S., and Thwaites, G.

Using firm-level data and variations in tariff reductions across industries in China, we find that input tariff liberalization is associated with lower labor markdowns across firms. We further document that these pro-competitive labor market effects are more pronounced for skill-intensive firms. Finally, we show that skill-intensive frms reduce markdowns much less in areas experiencing a larger increase in skilled labor supply measured using college expansion. Overall, our results suggest labor market power may be an important margin of adjustment to trade.  \n\nJEL: E2, F1, J2, J3, J42 Keywords: Trade liberalization, labor market power, skill intensity, China.  \n\n# 1 Introduction  \n\nHow does trade liberalization affect the labor market power of firms? Even though the labor markets effects of trade liberalization are extensively studied, the literature typically abstracts from labor monopsony. As a result, little is known about the impact of trade liberalization on the exercise of monopsony power against labor, and its underlying mechanism. In this paper, we document trade-induced labor markdowns in China.  \n\nAn emerging literature studies the impact of trade policy on firm markup strategies in the product market (e.g., De Loecker, Goldberg, Khandelwal, and Pavcnik, 2016 for India; Fan, Gao, Li and Tuan, 2018 for China). Growing product market concentration, rising inequality, and declining labor's share of income have led to renewed interest in the consequences of product market power as well as pro-competitive policies. Trade liberalization is in fact a commonly proposed pro-competitive policy (see for example Edmond, Midrigan and Xu 2015), and the rising threat of protectionism may well be anti-competitive.  \n\nWe conduct an empirical analysis of the impact of trade policy on labor market power based on Chinese firm-level data. China is an especially interesting case for multiple reasons. First, it is the largest economy in the world in PPP (purchasing power parity) terms with the largest labor force (twice as large as the U.S. and E.U. combined). Moreover, it is one of the world's largest importers and exporters. Second, China unilaterally liberalized toward the rest of the world in 2001 as part of its joining the WTO, a policy experiment we will utilize. Third, labor's share in China is quite low, standing at roughly 40 percent of value-added in manufacturing in 2001 and declining since. Finally, the nature of China's labor market fexibility is disputed. Many have viewed persistent low wages during the remarkable industrialization in China as the result of a Lewis (1954)- like, elastically supplied surplus labor from the rural sector (e.g, Storesletten, Zhao and Zillibotti, 2019). At the same time, however, the well-known Houkou registration system restricts internal migration across regions, and the college expansion since late 1990s also provides a quasi-natural experiment to well test the mechanism at work for skill heterogeneity in labor market. Globally, China faces competition from lower wage upstart countries like Vietnam.  \n\nIn practice, evaluating monopsony power in labor market starts with measuring labor markdowns, the wedge between the value of the marginal product of labor and the wage. Lacking direct data on wages and the marginal product of labor, we utilize the methods of Brooks, Kaboski, Li, and Qian (2021), who show the markdown can be measured as the ratio of the de Loecker and Warzynski (2012) markup measured using labor as the input (i.e., the ratio of the elasticity of revenue with respect to labor over the share of revenue that labor is paid) over the true markup (measured using a price-taking input, for example, material). The estimates show that markdowns are considerable in Chinese manufacturing.  \n\nTo examine the impact of trade liberalization on labor market power, we employ several data sources. First, China's panel data set on manufacturing firms, the Annual Survey of Chinese Industrial Enterprises (CIE), covers all state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and non-state-owned enterprises with annual sales of at least 5 million RMB (about \\$750,000 in 2008). The required data are available from 1999-2008 (with the hope to update to more recent years) and can be used to estimate markdowns at the firm (establishment) level. Second, tariff data at the industry level is then run through the input-output matrices to also yield tariffs on intermediates at the industry level. These data can be multiplied by the initial labor force mix to yield an initial local labor market exposure to the liberalization that varies across region. Third, we utilize household level data on hukou registrations to get region-specific measures of internal migrants from the 2000 and 2010 Censuses. Fourth, we use data on exports to distinguish exporting firms from non-exporting, and also distinguishing the intensity of exporting. Finally, we use the education information for workers from the 2004 census data to compute the skill intensity across firms, and college expansion information at the regional level to serve as exogenous shock to skilled labor supply.  \n\nThe liberalization episode involves both time and industry variation. The liberalization was sudden, involving a sharp and sudden cut in tariff rates in 2001. It reduced tariffs from high and variable across industries to much lower levels with much less variance. Thus, the liberalization disproportionately impacted industries that were initially high tariff and the initial tariff level interacted with a post-2001 dummy as an instrument is a plausibly exogenous instrument for industry level tariff variations. Moreover, preexisting industrial variation over regions lead to regional variation in the impact on labor markets. We then perform regression analysis on the firm-level markups and markdowns with respect to input and output tariffs.  \n\nWe document three findings. First, after joining the WTO, reductions in input tariffs were associated with lower markdowns, pointing to the importance of input trade liberalization on labor market power. Second, the decline in labor markdown after trade liberalization is more pronounced for skill-intensive firms compared to non skill-intensive firms. Third, to further test the skill intensive results, we use the exogenous shock to the supply of skilled labor in China through regional variations of college expansion in China. The results confirm that the difference in the markdown responses across firms' skill intensity becomes smaller in regions that experience college expansion and thus have an increase in skilled labor supply.  \n\nTo alleviate the concern that the declining markdowns are resulting from increased product markups after trade liberalization, we further conduct two exercises as robustness checks. First, we show that our main results of reduced markdowns and the heterogeneity effect across firms skill intensity are robust to controlling for lagged markups. Second, and more importantly, we show that the role of skill intensity on trade-induced lower markdowns is not present for trade-induced product markups.  \n\nRelated Literature  Our paper relates broadly to three strands of literature: the literature on monopsony power in labor markets, the literature on trade and labor market outcomes, and the literature on trade liberalization and product markups.  \n\nA growing number of papers investigate labor monopsony, especially in the United States (Card et al., 2018; Gouin-Bonenfant, 2018; Lamadon, Mogstad and Setzler, 2017; Berger, Herkenhoff and Mongey, 2018; Hershbein, Macaluso and Yeh, 2020). We borrow our measure for markdowns on labor from Brooks et al. (2021) and Brooks et al. (2020), which also focus on labor markdown in India and China. This paper contributes to this literature by looking at the impact of trade liberalization on firms’ labor monopsony power,however.  \n\nThe trade literature has extensively evaluated the labor markets effects of trade liberalization on wages, employment, and inequality (Davidson and Matusz, 2004; Amiti and Davis, 2012; Topalova, 2010; Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2007). Recently, the dramatic rise of China's importance in international trade has motivated a vibrant literature on the labor markets effects on trade-induced foreign competition. (David, Dorn and Hanson, 2013; Pierce and Schott, 2016; Kondo, 2018; Caliendo, Dvorkin and Parro, 2019). In contrast to the existing literature, we allow for labor market power. This departure allows us to isolate one potentially-important determinant of both measured wages and employment: the effects of trade on labor markdowns. Our findings also suggest that labor monopsony power can infuence the skill premium when trade-induced markdowns vary with firms' skill intensity.  \n\nOur paper also relates to the literature on the competitive effects of trade liberalization in product markets. Edmond, Midrigan and Xu (2015) and Arkolakis et al. (2019) provide theoretical and quantitative insights on the competitive effects of trade in the presence of variable markups. Goldberg et al. (2010) pioneered a growing literature on the effects of input tariff reductions on firm performance measured by product scope and new product. More recent studies examined the impact of trade liberalization on firm markup (e.g., de Loecker et al. (2016) for India, and Fan et al. (2018) for China). We build on this literature and estimate markdowns as the ratio of the labor-based markup to the materials-based markup. We show that our results are not mechanically due to changes in product markups. Specifically, we show the heterogeneous effects of skill intensity on tradeinduced markdowns are absent for product markups.  \n\n# 2 Data and Measurement  \n\n## 2.1 Firm-level Production and Tariff Data  \n\nThe main dataset used in the analysis is the firm-level production data from the Annual Survey of Chinese Industrial Enterprises (CIE). The CIE data is conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, and it covers all state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and non-state-owned enterprises with annual sales of at least 5 million RMB (about \\$760,000 in 2020). Between 2000 and 2006, the number of frms in the CIE data grows from approximately 162,000 to 300,000. The variation in the number of firms across years necessitates that we use an unbalanced panel in our analysis. We focus only on the manufacturing sector and 4-digit manufacturing industries. We construct real output, real capital stocks, and real intermediate input by defating the nominal values using defators at 2-digit industries from China? National Bureau of Statistics and a 1998 base year. One limitation of the CIE data is that it covers dis-proportionally larger firms. Since larger firms tend to have higher productivity, the CIE data covers about 76 percent of aggregate manufacturing gross output in China, but only about 37-43 percent of the overall employment in manufacturing.1 The omission of smaller firms in the CIE data precludes us from speaking to their behavior.  \n\nThe tariff data come from the World Trade Organization (WTO) website. We map the tariff data at the 8-digit harmonized system (HS) product level into 3-digit input/output (IO) industry classification based on the HS codes and the China's 2002 IO table. Our 3- digit output tariffs are just the simple average of all tariffs that fall into the corresponding category of the 3-digit IO industry code. We compute 3-digit input tariffs as an input-cost weighted average of output tariffs:  \n\n$$\n\\tau_{i t}^{\\mathrm{{input}}}=\\sum_{k}\\alpha_{k i}\\tau_{k t}^{\\mathrm{{output}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere Tkt $\\tau_{k t}^{\\mathrm{output}}$ is the 3-digit output trifs imposed on industry $k$ at time $t$ , and $\\alpha_{k i}$ is the percentage of industry $i$ 's total costs that were expended on products supplied by industry $k$ as intermediate inputs for industry $i$ . Finally, we map IO 3-digit tariffs into the 4-digit Chinese Industrial Classification (CIC) code system so that we can merge it with our firm-level production data.  \n\n## 2.2 Measuring Markups  \n\nTo construct measures of markups, we adopt the approach suggested by de Loecker and Warzynski (2012), which is build upon the insights from Hall (1987). de Locker and Warzynski show that the markup for firm i at time $\\mathrm{t}$ can be expressed as  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{i t}=\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{M}}{\\alpha_{i t}^{M}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $M$ indicates any fexible-chosen, price-taking input. $\\theta_{i t}$ is the output elasticity on input $M$ and $\\alpha_{i t}$ is the share of output revenue spent on input $M$ .We follow the IO literature and assume materials as the fexible-chosen inputs. We compute the factor payment share $\\alpha_{i t}$ directly using our production data since the data contains detailed firm-level information, including gross output and material expenditure.2 To estimate the output elasticity of materials, We use the production function estimation of Ackerberg, Caves and Frazer (2015) as in de Loecker and Warzynski (2012). First, we estimate a polynominal regression of logged output and obtain a non-parametric estimate of logged output free of measurement error. Then, we construct measures of productivity under the assumption of a 3rd-order translog specification of gross output. Finally, we estimate all coefficients in the production function by relying on the law of motion for productivity. The output elasticity of materials is computed based on the estimated coefficients of the production function.  \n\nAlthough the above approach for estimating markups is standard in the IO literature (see de Loecker and Eeckhout, 2017; Hershbein, Macaluso and Yeh, 2020; Brooks et al., 2021), it has some important shortcomings. First, this approach assumes that the production function is constant for all firms within an industry and only differs by a factor-neutral productivity parameter. Second, the identification of the production function relies on the assumptions that preclude the estimation of the output elasticity of materials, which is necessary to apply the de Loecker and Warzynski (2012) formula. In light of the shortcomings in the standard approach of estimating markups, we tested our baseline results using two alternative estimates of markups. In the first alternative approach, w estimate markups using the goss proft margin, which is computed as $\\frac{\\mathrm{sales}}{\\mathrm{costs}}$ The gross profit margin is a valid estimate of the markup if the production function is constant returns to scale and the firm is price-taking in its inputs.3 The second alternative approach assumes that the production function is Cobb-Douglas with respect to materials. Under this strong assumption, the output elasticity of materials is constant for all firms, and we choose $\\theta^{M}=0.8$ so that the average markup from using this approach equals the average measured using the gross profit margin method.  \n\n## 2.3 Measuring Markdowns  \n\nThis subsection describes the steps we take to construct measurements of markdowns. First, we compute the ratio of the labor-based markup to the materials-based markup. The equation can be expressed as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{i t}^{L}}{\\mu_{i t}^{M}}=\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L}}{\\alpha_{i t}^{L}}\\cdot\\frac{\\alpha_{i t}^{M}}{\\theta_{i t}^{M}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\alpha_{i t}^{L}$ and $\\alpha_{i t}^{M}$ represent the factor payment share for labor and materials, and $\\theta_{i t}^{L}$ and $\\theta_{i t}^{M}$ represent the output elasticities. Normally, $\\frac{\\mu_{i t}^{L}}{\\mu_{i t}^{M}}$ represents any unnamed distortion on labor relative to materials. Our assumption that materials is fexibly chosen implies that threnfe  a L identifies only distortion to labor.  \n\nSecond, we follow Brooks et al. (2021) and interpret the comovement of $\\frac{\\mu_{i t}^{L}}{\\mu_{i t}^{M}}$ witha frm's market share as the exercise of the monopsony power in the labor market. Specifically, we estimate the following equation  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{i t}^{L}}{\\mu_{i t}^{M}}=\\Gamma_{t}+\\delta_{i}+\\beta s_{i t}^{L}+\\epsilon_{i t}\n$$  \n\nwhere st = ietule denotes the firm $i$ 's share in the labor market $l$ at time $i$ . We rescale the ratio $\\frac{\\mu_{i t}^{L}}{\\mu_{i t}^{M}}$ so that the average intercept in the equation (1) is 1. Rescaling assures us that eliminating the market power in the labor market (i.e., the component of this markdown that covaries with labor market share) is equivalent to setting the average markdown to one.  \n\nThe final step of computing markdowns requires us to define the appropriate labor market for computing firm's labor market share. We consider labor markets to be segmented both geographically and by type of work. Geographically, we think provinces are appropriate choices for the labor market since the cross-province migration in China is restricted by the Hukou system. Regarding the type of work, we assume workers have a degree of specialization and hence cannot move perfectly across 4-digit industries.  \n\nTable 1 gives the summary statistics for the important measures in our data. The average values for markups range from 1.12 to 1.27, and the markdowns averaged about 3 percent across different measures. Notice that there is substantial variation in the measures of markdowns, and the markdown's distributions are strongly skewed to the left.  \n\nSince much of the results are robust to different measures of markups and markdowns, we only present the results using the baseline measure in the text and leave that of alternative measures to the appendix.  \n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Mean Markup ） (baseline) 1.27 Markup (alter-CD) 1.12 Markup (alter-CRS) 1.13 Markdown (baseline) 1.03 Markdown (alter-CD) 1.03 Markdown (alter-CRS) 1.02 Firm Share 0.003 Real Capital per Firm (000s RMB) 305 Real Materials per Firm (O00s RMB) 634</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Market shares are computed using 4-digit industries. Capital, materials, and output are in thousand RMB (in real value). The table winsorizes the 3 percent in both sides of the markup/markdown estimates of each 2-digit industry in each year.  \n\n# 3 Empirical Results  \n\n## 3.1  Trade Liberalization and Labor Markdowns  \n\nTo test the effect of trade liberalization on markdowns, we adopt the following regression equation as our baseline specification:  \n\n$$\nl o g(\\mu_{i s t})=\\alpha_{1}\\mathrm{tariff}_{s t}+\\mathbf{X}_{i t}+\\delta_{t}+\\delta_{s}+\\delta_{i}+\\epsilon\n$$  \n\nwhere $l o g(\\mu_{i s t})$ denotes the logarithm of firm-level markdowns by frm $i$ in year $t$ . tariff $^{s t}$ denotes the input or output tariff at time $t$ in a 4-digit CIC industry $s$ . The vector of controls, $\\mathbf{X}_{i t}$ , including logarithm of total output, size of employment, capital-labor ratio, and total labor payments, are firm-level characteristics that could potentially infuence the dynamics of markups and markdowns. We also control for the time fixed effect $\\left(\\delta_{t}\\right)$ ， the 2-digit CIC sector/industry fixed effect $\\left(\\delta_{s}\\right)$ , and the firm fixed effect $(\\delta_{i})$ . We cluster the standard errors at the industry-year pair throughout the analysis to account for the potential correlation between errors within each industry over time.  \n\nWe report the results from estimating equation (2) in columns 1-3 of Table 2. Column 1 shows that the estimated coefficient on input tariffs is significantly positive. The result suggeststhata $1\\%$ reduction in input tariffs leads to a decrease in log markdowns by about 0.14%. Column 2 shows the effect of output tariffs on markdowns. Although the estimated coefficient is also positive, the point estimate is less than half as large as that of input tariffs. Column 3 shows the results when we include both input tariffs and output tariffs in the regression. The effect of input tariffs changes only slightly, while the effect of output tariffs become statistically insignificant. Overall, the results suggest that input trade liberalization significantly reduces markdowns.  \n\nWe also test the effect of trade liberalization on markdowns using an alternative methodology. The regression specification is as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{l o g(\\mu_{i s t})=\\alpha_{1}\\mathrm{tariff}_{2000}+\\alpha_{2}\\mathrm{tariff}_{2000}\\times\\mathbb{1}_{t>2001}}\\ {+\\mathbf{X}_{i t}+\\delta_{t}+\\delta_{s}+\\delta_{i}+\\epsilon\\:\\qquad}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere tariff2ooo denotes the input or output tariff in year 2000, the beginning of the sample period. $\\mathbb{1}_{t>2001}$ is a dummary variable that indicates the period after 2001, the time of China's accession to the WTO. The identification in equation (3) is essentially a difference-in-difference estimation. We compare the change in log markdown in industries that experience greater tariff reductions to the corresponding change in industries that experience less tariff reduction before and after 2001.  \n\nColumns 4-6 of Table 2 report the results from estimating equation (3). The conclusion about the effect of trade liberalization on markdowns is largely unchanged. The estimated coefficient on the interaction term is significantly negative. The result suggests that markdowns decreased more after 2001 in industries that had higher tariffs in 2000 than in industries that had lower tariffs in 2000. Since industries with higher tariffs in 2000 experienced a larger tariff reduction after China's accession to the WTO, the results again suggest that trade liberalization leads to lower markdowns.  \n\nTable 2: Baseline Results About Trade and Markdown   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td rowspan=\"2\">(1)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(2)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(3) Sample period: 2000 - 2006</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(4)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(5)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">(6)</td></tr><tr><td>Dependent Variable = log(markdown)</td></tr><tr><td>Input tariff</td><td>0.144***</td><td></td><td>0.125*** (0.037)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Output tariff</td><td>(0.033)</td><td>0.057*** (0.013)</td><td>(0.015)</td><td>0.023</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year2000 input tariff</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.018</td><td></td><td>-0.027</td></tr><tr><td>Year2000 input tariff * postWTO dummy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.034) -0.049***</td><td></td><td>(0.036) -0.015</td></tr><tr><td>Year2000 output tariff</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.015)</td><td>0.054**</td><td>(0.015) 0.056**</td></tr><tr><td>Year2000 output tariff * postWTO dummy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.022) -0.048***</td><td>(0.023) -0.039**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.017)</td><td>(0.019)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>774,159</td><td>774,159</td><td></td><td>774,159</td><td>774,159</td><td>774,159</td><td>774,159</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R-squared</td><td>0.977</td><td>0.977</td><td></td><td>0.977</td><td>0.977</td><td>0.977</td><td>0.977</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: This table presents the estimates from equation (2) and equation (3).

Therefore, we test whether the impact of trade liberalization on markdowns differs across a firm's skill intensity. The regression specification we use is as follows:  \n\n$$\nl o g(\\mu_{i s t})=\\alpha_{1}\\mathrm{tariff}_{s t}+\\alpha_{2}\\mathrm{tariff}_{s t}\\times\\mathbb{1}\\{\\mathrm{skill~intensive}\\}_{i}+\\mathbf{X}_{i t}+\\delta_{t}+\\delta_{s}+\\delta_{i}+\\epsilon\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbb{1}\\{{\\mathrm{skill~intensive}}\\}_{i}$ is a dummy variable indicating whether firm $i$ is skill intensive. We construct the indicator of skill-intensive firms based on the fraction of employees that completed college education. $\\mathbb{1}\\{{\\mathrm{skill~intensive}}\\}_{i}$ is equal to 1 if the fraction of collegeeducated employees at firm $i$ is higher than the cutoff for skill-intensive firms.4  The markdown of skill-intensive firms may have a differential time pattern as compared to that of non skill-intensive firms. We allow this by interacting the indicator for skillintensive firms with time dummies and include those interaction terms as additional controls in the regression.  \n\nTable 3 shows the results from estimating equation (4) with different industry-specific cutoffs for skill-intensive firms. Columns 1-3 consider a firm to be skill intensive if its fraction of college-educated employees is above the median value of the distribution. We find that the estimated coefficients on the interaction terms are significantly positive. It suggests that skill-intensive firms reduce markdowns significantly more after trade liberalization as compared to non skill-intensive firms. This result is robust to the use of alternative cutoffs. Columns 4-6 change the cutoff to the 60th percentile of the distribution, while columns 7-9 use the value at the 7Oth percentile as the cutoff. The results show that as we raise the cutoff for skill intensive firms, the difference in the markdown response to trade liberalization across skill intensity becomes larger and is still statistically significant.  \n\nTable 3: Effect of Trade Liberalization on Markdown and Skill Intensity   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4) (5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td><td>(8)</td><td>(9)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Dependent variable = log(markdown) Sample period: 2000 - 2006</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Cutoff = median 0.134***</td><td colspan=\"3\">Cutoff = 60th percentile</td><td colspan=\"3\">Cutoff = 70th percentile</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Input tariff</td><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"3\">0.133***</td><td colspan=\"3\">0.130***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">0.136***</td><td colspan=\"3\">0.142***</td><td colspan=\"3\">0.141***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Input tariff×l{skill intensive}</td><td colspan=\"3\">(0.035)</td><td colspan=\"3\">(0.033)</td><td colspan=\"3\">(0.033)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">0.064* (0.033)</td><td colspan=\"3\">0.066**</td><td colspan=\"3\">(0.039) 0.094***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">0.041 (0.036)</td><td>(0.032)</td><td>0.056 (0.034)</td><td>(0.035)</td><td></td><td>0.083** (0.037)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Output tariff</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.039*** 0.003</td><td>0.047***</td><td>0.011</td><td></td><td>0.049***</td><td>0.012</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Output tariffxl{skill intensive}</td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.013) (0.016)</td><td>(0.013)</td><td>(0.015) 0.018</td><td></td><td>(0.013)</td><td>(0.015)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">0.046** 0.030</td><td colspan=\"3\">0.038* (0.022)</td><td>0.047*</td><td>0.021</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">(0.019) (0.021)</td><td colspan=\"3\">(0.021)</td><td>(0.025)</td><td>(0.026)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>0.978</td><td>649,306 649,306 649,306 0.978</td><td></td><td>0.978</td><td>649,306 649,306 649,306</td><td></td><td>649,306 649,306 649,306</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Adjusted R-squared</td><td colspan=\"3\">0.978</td><td colspan=\"3\">0.978 0.978</td><td>0.978 0.978</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: This table presents the estimates from equation (4).

To further test the underlying mechanism, we now turn to an exogenous shock to the supply of skilled labor in China - college expansion that started since the late 1990s.  \n\nBefore 1999, admission to higher education in China is carried out under the idea that “high-level talent should be in relatively short supply” (Hao and Tan, 1998). The pace of college enrollment expansion is gradual and the average yearly increase of college recruitment is about 3.2 percent from 1994 to 1998. However in 1999, the Chinese government ordered that the ministry of education revise its original recruitment plan to admit more students. This decision is implemented in part to rejuvenate the economy after the Asian financial crisis by opening new areas of investment and consumption. The total college recruitment jumped up by 47.4 percent in 1999, and the expansion in college admission has persisted ever since (Wang, 2014).  \n\nChina's college expansion was attained largely by scaling up enrollments in existing colleges (Feng and Xia, 2018; Ma, 2020), therefore we use the college enrollment at the beginning of the sample period, 2000, to classify provinces into high-expansion and lowexpansion areas. We use college enrollment data from China Yearly Provincial Statistics and population data from the Census to compute the college students to population ratio for each province in year 2000. $\\mathbb{1}\\{{\\mathrm{more~expansion}}\\}_{r}=1$ if the college student ratio from theprovince $r$ is above the median of the distribution.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{l o g(\\mu_{i s r t})=\\alpha_{1}\\mathrm{tariff}_{s t}+\\alpha_{2}\\mathrm{tariff}_{s t}\\times\\mathbb{1}\\left\\{\\mathrm{skill~intensive}\\right\\}_{i}+\\alpha_{3}\\mathrm{tariff}_{s t}\\times\\mathbb{1}\\left\\{\\mathrm{more~expansic}\\right\\}}\\ {+\\alpha_{3}\\mathrm{tariff}_{s t}\\times\\mathbb{1}\\left\\{\\mathrm{skill~intensive}\\right\\}_{i}\\times\\mathbb{1}\\left\\{\\mathrm{more~expansion}\\right\\}_{r}+\\mathbf{X}_{i t}+\\delta_{i s t}+\\epsilon_{i s r t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the subscript $r$ denotes the province, and $\\mathbb{1}\\{{\\mathrm{more~expansion}}\\}_{r}$ is a dummy variable that indicates whether the province $r$ experiences a large expansion in college admission. As in the baseline specification, $\\mathbf{X}_{i t}$ represents firm-level controls (total output, size of employment, capital-labor ratio, and total labor payments). We use $\\pmb{\\delta}_{i s t}$ to denote all the fixed effects in the regression. It includes the time fixed effect, the 2-digit CIC sector/industry fixed effect, and the firm fixed effect. We continue to allow different time patterns in markdowns for firms with different skill intensity. In this case, we divide the firms into four groups based on whether they are a skill-intensive firm and whether they are located in a high-expansion area. We interact the group dummies with time dummies and include the interaction terms in the regression. We restrict the sample period to be 2003-2006 when estimating equation (5) since the earliest year that students from 1999 college expansion enter the labor market is 2003.  \n\nTable 4 shows the results from estimating equation (5). Our primary focus is the coefficients on the triple interaction term, and these coefficients are estimated to be negative. The results suggest that although skill-intensive firms are more affected by input trade liberation as compared to non skill-intensive firms, the difference in the markdown responses across firms’ skill intensity becomes smaller when the region experiences an increase in skilled labor. Since many coastal provinces are classified as high expansion areas, the results may be driven by the differential time pattern of markdowns in coastal provinces. To address this concern, we create a dummy for coastal provinces, and interact it with time dummies. Columns 4-6 show the results when we include coastal-time dummies as additional controls in the regression. The estimated time trend for coastal provinces is insignificant and the results are basically unchanged. We also note that columns 1-3 assume that the students do not move out of the province for employment after they complete their college education. This assumption is not necessarily true in reality, and we test how sensitive our results are to this assumption by dropping the top five provinces with the highest out-migration fows.5 Columns 7-9 show that the point estimate on the triple interaction terms is slightly smaller after excluding high migration provinces, but is still statistically significant.  \n\nTable 4: Effect of Tariffs on Markdowns and Skill Intensity, College Expansion   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"4\"></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2) (3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5) (6)</td><td>(7) (8)</td><td>(9)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Dependent variable = log(markdown) Sample period: 2003-2006</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Baseline</td><td colspan=\"3\">Add coastal area fixed effects Exclude provinces with high out-migration fows</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Input tariff</td><td>0.035</td><td>-0.023</td><td>0.020</td><td>-0.032</td><td>0.010</td><td>-0.046</td></tr><tr><td>(0.055)</td><td></td><td>(0.059) (0.054)</td><td>(0.057)</td><td>(0.062)</td><td>(0.067)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Input tariff ×I{skill intensive}</td><td>0.224***</td><td></td><td>0.262*** 0.228***</td><td>0.263***</td><td>0.212***</td><td>0.235***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.068)</td><td></td><td>(0.070) (0.068)</td><td>(0.070)</td><td>(0.078)</td><td>(0.083)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Input tariff ×I{college expansion}</td><td>0.096</td><td></td><td>0.140* 0.099</td><td>0.141*</td><td>0.119</td><td>0.160*</td></tr><tr><td>(0.072)</td><td></td><td>(0.078) (0.072)</td><td>(0.078)</td><td>(0.074)</td><td>(0.082)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Input tariff ×I{skill intensive} xI{college expansion}</td><td>-0.181*</td><td></td><td>-0.222** -0.185*</td><td>-0.225**</td><td>-0.169*</td><td>-0.196*</td></tr><tr><td>(0.097)</td><td>(0.101)</td><td>(0.097)</td><td>(0.101)</td><td>(0.101)</td><td>(0.110)</td></tr><tr><td>Output tariff</td><td></td><td>0.051***0.057*** (0.017)</td><td></td><td>0.044***0.052***</td><td></td><td>0.047** 0.057**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Output tariff ×I{skill intensive}</td><td></td><td>0.027</td><td>(0.019)</td><td>(0.017) (0.018) 0.029</td><td>0.043</td><td>(0.022) (0.024) -0.005</td></tr><tr><td>(0.034)</td><td>-0.027 (0.031)</td><td>(0.033)</td><td>-0.025 (0.031)</td><td>(0.035)</td><td>(0.036)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Output tariff ×I{college expansion}</td><td></td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.039</td><td>-0.010 -0.038</td><td></td><td>-0.005 -0.037</td></tr><tr><td>(0.026)</td><td>(0.028)</td><td>(0.026)</td><td>(0.029)</td><td>(0.028)</td><td>(0.031)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Output tariff ×I{skill intensive}</td><td></td><td>-0.006 0.037</td><td></td><td>-0.007 0.037</td><td></td><td>-0.021 0.016</td></tr><tr><td>(0.046)</td><td>(0.047)</td><td>(0.046)</td><td>(0.047)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">xl{college expansion}</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.047) (0.052)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>488,976</td><td>488,976</td><td>488,976</td><td>488,976 488,976</td><td>488,976</td><td>441,435 441,435</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R-squared</td><td>0.980</td><td>0.980 0.980</td><td></td><td>0.980 0.980</td><td>0.980</td><td>0.980 0.980</td><td>6441,435</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: This table presents the estimates from equation (5).

Therefore, an increase in the true markup would mechanically cause a decrease in our measured markdown. In this subsection, we present three results that address the concern that our results on input liberalization and markdowns arise from a mechanical effect of tariffs on product markups.  \n\nFirst, we test whether our baseline results about the effect of input trade liberalization on markdowns are robust to controlling for markups. But controlling for contemporaneous markups in the regression is problematic because markup also responds to changes in tariffs (see the discussion of “bad controls\" in Angrist and Pischke, 2009.) Therefore, we include one-period lagged log markups as controls in the regression. Table 5 shows that controlling for lagged markups has little impact on the estimated coefficients in the regressions. Input trade liberalization continues to have a significant negative effect on markdowns even after controlling for lagged markups.  \n\nTable 5: Baseline Results on Trade and Markdowns Controlling for Lagged Markups   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2) Dependent Variable = log(markdown)</td><td>(3) Sample period: 2000 - 2006</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>Input tariff</td><td>0.222*** (0.042)</td><td></td><td>0.246*** (0.047)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Output tariff</td><td></td><td>0.038** (0.016)</td><td>-0.025 (0.019)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year2000 input tariff</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.028 (0.046)</td><td></td><td>0.001 (0.045)</td></tr><tr><td>Year2000 input tariff * postWTO dummy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.057*** (0.021)</td><td></td><td>-0.037* (0.020)</td></tr><tr><td>Year2000 output tariff</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.048</td><td>0.035</td></tr><tr><td>Year2000 output tariff * postWTO dummy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.033) -0.045**</td><td>(0.035) -0.023</td></tr><tr><td>lagged log(markup)</td><td>0.042***</td><td>0.041***</td><td>0.042***</td><td>0.042***</td><td>(0.023) 0.042***</td><td>(0.026) 0.042***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.008)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>408,703</td><td>408,703</td><td>408,703</td><td>408,703</td><td>408,703</td><td>408,703</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.979</td><td>0.979</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0.979</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.979</td><td>0.979</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R-squared</td><td>0.979</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: This table presents the estimates from equation (2) and equation (3) while controlling for lagged log markup.

We find that input tariff liberalization significantly lowers labor markdowns, and the effect is more pronounced for skill-intensive firms. We also document that the differential markdown response across skill intensity becomes muted in areas that experience a larger increase in the supply of skilled labor. Overall, our results are important in suggesting that the impacts of trade liberalization are pro-competitive in labor markets.  \n\n# References  \n\nAckerberg, Daniel, Kevin Caves, and Garth Frazer. 2015. “Structural identification of production functions.\" Econometrica, 83(6): 2411-2415.   \nAmiti, Mary, and Donald R Davis. 2012. “Trade, frms, and wages: Theory and evidence.\" The Review of economic studies, 79(1): 1-36.   \nAngrist, Joshua D., and J orn-Steffen Pischke. 2009.

This paper discusses how we can measure monopsony power by combining insights from models based on both frictions and idiosyncrasies. It presents some evidence from the United Kingdom and the United States about how monopsony power varies across the wage distribution within markets, over the business cycle and over time. (JEL: I21, I24)  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThis lecture is named after Alfred Marshall, widely regarded as the founder of neo-classical economics and the marginal approach as a coherent body of thought, though he built on and combined the ideas of many others. Neo-classical economics is often characterized as primarily being concerned with the allocation of scarce resources to competing ends through the interplay of demand and supply rather than the more distributional issues discussed by the classical economists. Yet Marshall's The Principles of Economics (Marshall 1890) opens with a discussion of inequality (which he thought a thoroughly bad thing, viewing the “degradation\"” of the poor—-his phrase—-more as a consequence than a cause of their poverty') before moving on to a discussion of competition, which he thought, on balance, was good rather than bad and that other well-intended institutions might be more harmful.2 But he was not starryeyed; Marshall (1890, p. 12) described how “free competition [. . .] was set loose to run, like a huge untrained monster, its wayward course” and that this had impacts, good and bad: \\*\"the abuse of their new power by able but uncultured business men led to evils on every side; it unfitted mothers for their duties, it weighed down children with overwork and disease; and in many places it degraded the race'\". Competition needed an eye on it and, possibly, some regulation, to channel the wayward, untrained monster to work for good and not for evil.  \n\nThat agenda of concern about inequality and competition remains as important as ever. We know from basic economics that markets cannot be relied on to produce levels of inequality that are fair and command political legitimacy. Economists do not often regard inequality as a market failure (it is put in a different box), but ordinary people do, and they are right and we are wrong. We also know that markets contain within them the incentives to acquire market power, and we have to be on our guard against the effort put into monopolizing markets. And, because productivity growth at the frontier is based on improvements in knowledge, which is a public good, we know we cannot rely on markets alone to deliver an efficient level of economic growth, which is the basis for improvements in the quality of life.  \n\nSo, a primary role of economists should be tinkering with the system to make sure that the economy functions well—to train the monster so that its course is not too wayward. This lecture is about one small part of that wider endeavour: labour market competition or monopsony. The idea of employer market power—monopsony or oligopsony—originated with Joan Robinson (1933). For many years, the idea that most employers have market power over their workers had few buyers, but recent years have seen a resurgence in academic interest in monopsony.  \n\nThere is no doubt that the labour supply curve is not perfectly elastic and that employers do have some market power over their workers. Common sense tells us that if employers cut the wage by a cent, it is simply not true that all the existing workers immediately leave as perfect competition predicts, though they may find it harder to recruit and retain workers. It is not just common sense that supports this conclusion: We have an increasing number of papers with high quality research designs that show that the labour supply curve facing an employer is not infinitely elastic (see, e.g., the experimental studies of Caldwell and Oehlsen 2018; Dube et al 2020).  \n\nThe questions of interest are shifting from \\*Do employers have monopsony power over their workers? to “How much monopsony power?\", “How does monopsony power vary?, \"What are the consequences of monopsony power?, and \"What should be done about monopsony power? To answer these questions and for monopsony to be more than an abstract idea, we need to be able to assess the impacts of monopsony and that requires the measurement of monopsony power. A variety of measures exist in the literature, some derived from particular models of monopsony and others drawn from measures of market power used in the literature on product market competition, for example, measures of concentration. But there is no unifying view.  \n\nThere are two main sources of monopsony power, both identified by Joan Robinson, who was the first to discuss the idea formally (Robinson 1933). First, search frictions mean that it takes time (and perhaps money) for workers to find and change jobs: Burdett and Mortensen (1998) is the classic reference for a model of this type. Examples of measures of monopsony based on this model are the wage elasticity of separations (see the meta-study of Sokolova and Sorensen 2021) and the share of recruits from employment (see, e.g., Hirsch et al. 2020). The second theoretical foundation is the idea that workers care about many dimensions of a job not just the wage so that employers are not perfect substitutes for each other. This is typically modelled by assuming there is an idiosyncratic component to the utility a worker gets from an employer and workers are choosing an employer from a discrete choice model (see, e.g., Card et al. 2018). This approach suggests using the elasticity of the labour supply curve (or applicants as in Azar, Berry, and Marinescu 2019) as a measure of monopsony. On the measurement side, we have some papers using concentration ratios in employment or vacancies (Abel, Terneyro, and Thwaites 2018; Azar, Marinescu, and Steinbaum 2019, 2020; Azar et al. 2020; inter alia). There are also other papers by Caldwell and Danieli (2020) and Jarosch, Nimczik and Sorkin (2019) proposing measures of worker outside options.  \n\nAll these ideas have some merit, but how they fit together is unclear. One of the purposes of this paper is to present a model that encompasses both frictions and idiosyncrasies and in which one can assess the circumstances in which the different proposed measures of monopsony power are valid. And this more general model is useful because more restrictive models often have specific conclusions that derive more from the particular assumptions made than the underlying economics. The approach is illustrated by an empirical exercise, investigating how the separation elasticity varies across the wage distribution, with the arrival rate of job offers and over time.  \n\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. The next section presents a brief refresher on monopsony and discusses, in very general terms, how one might measure employer monopsony power. Section 3 presents a simple model of worker effort, Section 4 a simple dynamic model, and Section 5 a model of worker quit behaviour that incorporates both idiosyncrasies and frictions. Section 6 estimates separation elasticities and Section 7 what policies we should be using to address monopsony power.Section 8 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Measuring Monopsony Power  \n\n### 2.1. The Textbook Model of Monopsony  \n\nThe static textbook model of monopsony has an employer with a revenue function $F(N)$ facing a labour supply curve $N(w)$ . The first-order condition for profit maximization can be written as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{F^{\\prime}(N)-w}{w}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{N w}}.\n$$  \n\nThe degree of monopsony power is given by the elasticity of the labour supply curve facing the firm. Models of monopsony based on idiosyncrasy have this form (e.g. Card et al. 2018) so this way of looking at the problem leads to the measure used, inter alia, in Azar, Berry, and Marinescu (2019), Lamadon, Mogstad, and Setzler (2019), and Kroft et al. (2020). This approach cannot incorporate frictions in any meaningful sense.  \n\n### 2.2. The Comparison of Wages and Marginal Products  \n\nThe simplest, most direct way, to assess the extent of monopsony power would be a comparison of the wage with the marginal revenue product, that is, try to estimate the left-hand side of equation (1). Because the marginal revenue product is not directly observable, any such approach is likely to base an estimate on an adjustment to the average revenue product.3 There is a serious identification problem here: Simply considering the wage relative to the average revenue product (which can, alternatively, be written as the labour share or unit labour costs) requires some identifying assumptions about the technology, the mark-down from monopsony power, and the mark-up from monopoly power. For example, there is a large literature seeking to estimate mark-ups and how they have evolved over time (see Basu 2019, for a recent overview), but these studies typically allow only for monopoly power, and the data could be explained equally well by monopsony power: Stansbury and Summers (2020) go further and argue that much of the variation over time is better explained by declining worker power rather than rising product market power.  \n\nOne way out of this problem is to try to have a measure of monopsony power such as concentration ratios and see how variables like the labour share (or simply the level of wages) are related to this. A number of recent papers do this (e.g. see Abel, Terneyro, and Thwaites 2018; Benmelech, Bergman, and $\\mathrm{Kim}2020$ ; Berger, Herkenhoff and Mongey 2019; Caldwell and Danieli 2020, for papers that link concentration and wages; Arnold 2020, for a link between mergers and wages; and the review in Manning 2021). There are some potential difficulties with this approach; concentration ratios by industry could be used to measure both product and labour market power. And the use of concentration ratios to measure market power has fallen out of favour in the industrial organization (IO) literature (see Berry, Gaynor, and Morton 2019; Syverson 2019) because it is an endogenous market outcome and can, in some circumstances, be increased when the market becomes more competitive (this is the case in Burdett and Mortensen 1998).  \n\nFor this reason, the IO literature has moved towards seeking to estimate the elasticity of demand curves as a measure of product market power. This paper will take this approach to deriving measures of monopsony power, focusing on the elasticity of the labour supply curve to the firm, that is, trying to estimate the right-hand side of equation (1).  \n\nOne problem with this approach is that, to use the terms of Bronfenbrenner (1956), this leads to a measure of potential monopsony power, but there is a question of how much it is exercised. There may be laws and institutions like minimum wages and trade unions that mean that not all potential monopsony power is translated into lower wages, or other outcomes we ultimately care about. But, perhaps more important and pervasive than all of these is the less organized resistance of individual workers and small groups of workers to the exercise of monopsony power. The next section sketches a simple model with this idea.  \n\n## 3. A Simple Model of Worker Effort  \n\nIn a competitive labour market, your employer tells you what to do, and because the wage is equal to the marginal product, you risk losing your job if you deviate from this and are found out.4 But if the wage is below the marginal product, there is some scope for shirking without risk of job loss even if detected as long as you remain profitable. Because labour contracts are incomplete (or in Marx's terminology, there is a distinction between labour and labour power), there is likely to be a tussle between worker and employer on how much work is done.5 Workers may manage to reduce the gap between marginal products and wages by reducing their marginal product.  \n\nTo see how this might limit the exercise of monopsony power, consider a very simple model. Workers have utility $u=w-e$ where $w$ is the wage and $e$ is the effort on the job. Firms have constant returns to scale, but the marginal product depends positively on effort $p(e)$ . The firm has some monopsony power, and its labour supply depends on the utility that the firm offers workers $N(u)$ ; for simplicity, we assume this is iso-elastic with elasticity ENu·  \n\nIf firms can offer a package of the wage and effort, then it will choose the wage and effort to maximize  \n\n$$\n\\left[p\\left(e\\right)-w\\right]N\\left(w-e\\right)=\\left[p\\left(e\\right)-w\\right]\\left(w-e\\right)^{\\varepsilon_{N u}}.\n$$  \n\nMaximizing equation (2) with respect to the effort and wage leads to the effort being set at the efficient level $p^{\\prime}(e)=1$ and the usual monopsony power formula will apply though in terms of utility and the surplus rather than wages and marginal products, that is, we will have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{p(e)-e-u}{u}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{N u}}.\n$$  \n\nBut we will assume a different set-up: a two-step model in which the firm can unilaterally choose the wage in a first stage, but the effort is determined in a second stage. While workers can decide, based on the utility offered, whether to work for the employer in the first stage, we assume that in the second stage they will stay if the utility from doing so is greater than zero. We model the effort determination stage as a bargain between employer and worker to reflect the tussle within the workplace over the determination of effort. Given the wage, we assume effort is chosen to maximize an asymmetric Nash bargain:  \n\n$$\n[p(e)-w]\\left[w-e\\right]^{\\beta},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta({\\underline{{>}}}0)$ is a measure of worker power in the effort determination stage. The first-order condition can be written as  \n\n$$\np^{\\prime}(e)\\left[w-e\\right]=\\beta\\left[p(e)-w\\right].\n$$  \n\nThe wage set in the first stage leads to a certain effort level in the second stage denoted by the relationship $e=e(w)$ . The first-order condition for the employer's choice of the wage in the first stage can now be written as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{p(e)-e-u}{u}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{N u}}\\left[\\frac{1-p^{\\prime}\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w}}{1-\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w}}\\right].\n$$  \n\nCompared to equation (3), there is an extra term in square brackets. If this term is bigger than 1, then the employer has more monopsony power than the standard formula, while it has less if it is less than 1.  \n\nIf $\\beta=\\varepsilon_{N u}.$ then effort is at the efficient level and the standard formula in equation (3) is correct. The intuition is that, in this case, the objective function in the wage determination stage, equation (2), coincides with that in the effort determination stage, equation (4) (see Manning 1987, for this type of model in a union bargaining context). By the envelope condition, the outcome must then be the same as in the onestep model in which the employer unilaterally chooses wage and the efficient level of effort. And profits must be highest in this case. The implication is that employers want the workers to have some bargaining power in effort determination as a commitment device against excessive ex post exploitation of workers. If employers cannot make this commitment, then profits will be lower because workers rationally expect they will be treated badly so will not come to work for the firm in the first place.  \n\nIt is natural to consider the case where workers have more power in effort determination than employers would like (i.e. $\\beta>\\varepsilon_{N u})$ .Appendix A shows that in this case, we have effort (and productivity) inefficiently low and employers have less effective monopsony power than the standard formula in equation (3) implies.  \n\nThis suggests that what happens within the firm, outside the labour market, may be very important in determining labour market outcomes. For example, concerns about fairness (see Dube, Giuliano, and Leonard 2019 for evidence on the relevance of this) could be seen as evolved responses to limit the ability of employers to exploit the greater monopsony power they have over incumbent workers or to act as discriminating monopsonists. Otherwise, if you turn up for work and your employer has cut your wage, then there is little that can be done about that. Like many evolved traits, it may also have unintended consequences, for example, nominal wage rigidity.  \n\nThe model presented here suggests that the impact of monopsony power on worker effort (and hence productivity) within the workplace may be a neglected topic. One reason it is ignored is that it is a hard process to observe, though Coviello, Deserranno, and Persico (2021) show increases in productivity in response to a mandated increase in the minimum wage, which is consistent with the mechanism proposed here.  \n\nThe rest of this paper follows the tradition of ignoring worker effort and reverts to a model in which effort is no longer present. What is different about this model is that it tries to incorporate both dynamics and an idiosyncratic aspect to preferences.  \n\n## 4. A Model of Dynamic Monopsony  \n\nConsider a very simple dynamic model (which can be found in Manning 2003). At any date $t$ , the state variable for the firm will be the labour force that it had in the last period, $N_{t-1}$ . We assume that in each period the firm sets the wage to maximize the present discounted value of profits.6 To keep things simple, we assume constant returns to labour, $p$ . Define a value function $\\Pi(N_{t-1})$ to be the maximized discounted value of future profits from date $t$ onwards. The value function will satisfy  \n\n$$\n\\Pi(N_{t-1})=\\operatorname*{max}_{w}(p-w)N_{t}+\\beta\\Pi(N_{t}).\n$$  \n\nThe firm is assumed to face a dynamic labour supply curve where the quit rate of existing workers depends on the current wage offered $q(w)$ , and there is a flow of recruits $R(w)$ that also depends on the wage. This means that employment evolves accordingto  \n\n$$\nN_{t}=\\left[1-q\\left(w\\right)\\right]N_{t-1}+R\\left(w\\right).\n$$  \n\nThis setting is general enough to incorporate both the frictional and idiosyncratic views of the foundations of employer monopsony power. The case where there are no frictions, only idiosyncrasy is the specification $q(w)=1$ in which case each period is independent of the previous period, so the model reduces to the static one. If there are only frictions and no idiosyncrasies, then the specification of the quit function will be that the worker quits whenever they receive a wage offer above the current wage. Perfect competition can be thought of as the case where there are no frictions and no idiosyncrasies in which case the quit rate is 1 and recruits O if the pay is below the maximum wage offered by other firms.  \n\nThe dynamic labour supply curve (equation (8)) is written such that worker decisions depend only on the wage offered, a specification that deserves some discussion given that there is also a state variable (the inherited level of employment).7 There are several possible interpretations of this: Workers may be myopic so they take into account only the current wage in making their decisions. Or they may think the current wage will last forever, which will be the case in the steady-state but not when considering deviations from the steady-state. Or it may be that the current wage is the only available relevant information for basing a current decision on; this would be the case if we had a Markov model.  \n\nAppendix B shows that in the steady-state, the relationship between the marginal product and the wage can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(p-w\\right)}{w}=\\frac{\\left[1-\\beta\\left(1-q\\right)\\right]}{q(\\varepsilon_{R w}-\\varepsilon_{q w})}=\\frac{1}{\\mu}.\n$$  \n\nEquation (9) shows the centrality of the recruitment and quit elasticities for the market power of employers, something that is reflected in their use in many papers seeking to measure monopsony power (see Sokolova and Sorensen 2021, for a metastudy). There is a relationship between equations (9) and (1) because the long-run labour supply to the firm can be written as $N(w)=R(w)/q(w)$ so that $\\varepsilon_{N w}=\\varepsilon_{R w}-$ $\\varepsilon_{q w}$ . But, there is a difference between the appropriate measures of monopsony power in static and dynamic models. If employers discount the future, then the degree of monopsony power will be higher than the textbook static model would predict given the elasticity of the labour supply curve to the firm. The reason is that the wage elasticity of labour supply is lower in the short- than in the long-run. The ratio of the right-hand side of equation (1) to the right-hand side of equation (9) is approximately given by the quit rate divided by the sum of the quit rate and interest rate. As the quit rate is perhaps about $20\\%$ and the real interest about $5\\%$ , equation (9) implies that employers have approximately $20\\%$ more monopsony power than the standard static model would imply.  \n\nThis simple dynamic model offers a justification for using quit and recruitment elasticities but does not explain where these come from. To understand these better, we need to provide more details about the worker's behaviour.  \n\n## 5. The Determination of Quit Rates  \n\nIn this section, we model the quit rate function of the previous section. To do this, we want a model that incorporates both frictions (so it must be dynamic) and idiosyncratic preferences for jobs. We consider one firm currently paying a wage $w$ .Denoteby $V(w)$ the value of being employed in this firm at the start of each period.  \n\nIn each period, we assume that a worker currently employed in the firm gets an idiosyncratic mean zero draw of utility, $\\eta$ (assumed i.i.d. across time, perhaps more for analytical convenience than realism) so that the utility of staying in this firm after the realization of the idiosyncratic shock can be written as  \n\n$$\nu(w)+\\eta+\\beta_{w}V(w^{\\prime}(w))=X(w)+\\eta,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta_{\\nu}$ is the discount factor of workers, and we use the notation $w^{\\prime}(w)$ todenote the wage in the next period if the current wage is $w$ . This allows for the possibility that the current wage is expected to be permanent but also that it is more transitory.8 It will be convenient to use the notation $X(w)$ in what follows: It is the expected discounted utility of remaining in the firm, excluding the current idiosyncratic shock.  \n\nThe worker does not have to remain with this firm. They always have the option of quitting to unemployment, which is assumed to have the present discounted value Oof $X^{u}$ . We do not have to specify an idiosyncratic shock for unemployment because in work that can be defined as relative to unemployment. Define the following function:  \n\n$$\nG(X(w),X^{u})=E\\operatorname*{max}\\left[X(w)+\\eta,X^{u}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere the expectation is over the distribution of $\\eta$ . Models of this type typically make some specific assumption about the distribution of $\\eta$ (e.g. that it is Frechet or a type 1 extreme value distribution), but it is convenient, simpler, and more general to work with the $G$ function as it contains all the information we need.9 $G$ will be an increasing function of both its arguments, and an equal increase in $(X,X^{u})$ leads to an equal increase in $G$ .McFadden (1978) showed that the probability of choosing each option is the derivative of the $G$ function with respect to that argument: These derivatives sum to 1. So, the quit rate to unemployment if the worker has no other option can be written as $G_{X^{u}}=1-G_{X}$  \n\nWhile the worker always has the option of quitting the job for unemployment, we also assume that they may have an option of quitting to another job if they get a better offer. Assume that the “other” jobs are possibly paying different wages but also have an idiosyncratic component. Assume the worker has an $M$ alternative job offers offering wages $(w_{1},...,w_{M})$ with idiosyncratic components $(\\eta_{1},...,\\eta_{M})$ , and with functions $(X_{1},...,X_{M})$ analogous to equation (10). Define the following function:  \n\n$H(X(w),X^{u},X_{1},...,X_{M})=E\\operatorname*{max}[X(w)+\\eta,X^{u},X_{1}+\\eta_{1},...,X_{M}+\\eta_{M}],$ (12) where the expectation is now over the joint distribution of $(\\eta,\\eta_{1},...,\\eta_{M})$ . Just as for the $G$ function in equation (11), the derivative with respect to the utility from an option is the probability of choosing that option.  \n\nThe use of the $H$ function allows the incorporation of a range of possibilities. In search models, it is most common to assume that the worker has at most one other job opportunity in each period; this is a special case of the formulation.10 Search models often do not have any idiosyncrasy, in which case the $H$ function would just be the max of the $X$ functions. On the other hand, models with idiosyncrasy generally assume the worker has the choice of every firm at every moment; again this is a special case, but one could imagine an intermediate case in which only a sub-set of alternative firms is available at each moment. For the moment, we can be a bit vague because all that matters is the dependence of the $H$ function on the wage offered by this firm. So, with some abuse of notation, simply write $H(X(w))$ , which should be interpreted as the expectation of the right-hand side of equation (12) over any stochastic elements in it (the number of other job offers and the wages in those offers).  \n\nAssume with probability $\\lambda$ a currently employed worker gets alternative job offers. This means that we can write the value of being in a job paying $w,V(w)$ ,as  \n\n$$\nV(w)=(1-\\lambda)G[X(w)]+\\lambda H[X(w)],\n$$  \n\nwhere we have suppressed the dependence of the $G$ and $H$ functions on other factors. The separation rate for workers will be given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{q\\left(w\\right)=\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\left[1-\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial G\\left[X\\left(w\\right)\\right]}{\\partial X}\\right]+\\lambda\\left[1-\\frac{\\partial H\\left[X\\left(w\\right)\\right]}{\\partial X}\\right]}\\ {=\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\left[1-G_{X}\\right]+\\lambda[1-H_{X}]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nthat is, 1 minus the probability of remaining with this firm. In what follows, it is sometimes useful to define the quit rate $q^{G}(X)$ if the worker only has the option of quitting for non-employment and the quit rate $q^{H}(X)$ if the worker has the option of quitting for another job, that is,  \n\n$$\nq^{G}(X)=[1-G_{X}],\\qquadq^{H}(X)=[1-H_{X}].\n$$  \n\nNote that some of the quits when the worker has alternative job offers will be to nonemployment so these quit functions are not the same as the quits to non-employment and employment, respectively (though it may be a reasonable empirical approximation that workers very rarely quit to unemployment when they have another job offer.)  \n\nWe can prove the following result about the quit elasticity.  \n\nPROPOsITION: In a steady-state, the elasticity of the quit function can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{q w}=\\left[\\alpha\\frac{\\partial\\ln q^{G}(X)}{\\partial X}+(1-\\alpha)\\frac{\\partial\\ln q^{H}(X)}{\\partial X}\\right]\\frac{w u^{\\prime}\\left(w\\right)}{1-\\beta_{w}\\varphi\\left[1-q\\left(w\\right)\\right]},\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{(1-\\lambda)q^{G}(X)}{\\left[(1-\\lambda)q^{G}(X)+\\lambda q^{H}(X)\\right]}\n$$  \n\nis the share of quits to unemployment when the worker has no other job offers and $\\varphi=\\partial w^{\\prime}/\\partial w$ , that is, how much workers expect future wages to change when current wageschange.  \n\nProof: See Appendix C.  \n\nThis result shows that the quit elasticity has a number of sources. The first is the sensitivity of worker mobility decisions to the present discounted value of jobs as represented by the sensitivity of the functions $H$ and $G$ to $X$ This, in turn, is likely to be influenced by how close substitutes are jobs with different employers, which is often modelled as the degree of idiosyncrasy.  \n\nThe final term of the right-hand side of equation (16) tells us that the higher the quit elasticity is, the more sensitive the present discounted value of the job to the wage is. This is influenced by the discount factor, the extent to which current wages are expected to persist into the future, and how long the worker expects to be with the firm (quit rate). If the quit rate is high, then labour supply to the firm is likely to be less elastic; this is the opposite to what is often argued, namely that jobs with high turnover are very competitive.\"\"  \n\nOne can also potentially use this set-up to explain why more concentrated labour markets might be associated with more monopsony power. If greater employer concentration leads to fewer alternative wage offers, then it is plausible that this leads to a lower sensitivity of $q^{H}$ to the value of the job.  \n\nAn alternative way of modelling a more concentrated labour market is to assume that the arrival rate of alternative job offers, $\\lambda$ , is lower. From equations (15) and (16), a lower level of $\\lambda$ lowers the quit rate; the impact of this has been discussed earlier. But, it also affects the quit elasticity if $q^{G}$ and $q^{H}$ have different sensitivities. In many models, this is an assumption. For example, in Burdett and Mortensen (1998), quits to unemployment are assumed to be completely exogenous, unrelated to the wage, in whichcase $q^{G}$ does not depend on $X$ . In this case, a lower arrival rate of job offers increases the monopsony power of employers. This is why the fraction of recruits or quits to employment is sometimes used as a measure of monopsony power. But, we can write down models with the opposite result in which $q^{G}$ is more sensitive than $q^{H}$ to the wage so this is ultimately an empirical question.  \n\nThis discussion has been about the wage elasticity of quits, but equation (9) shows that the elasticity of recruits with respect to the wage is also important. This has received much less attention in the literature largely because it is much harder to estimate. In longitudinal data, one can observe how the current wage affects future separations, but one does not directly observe the wage that a worker would receive if they were recruited to some other firm.  \n\nThe literature often makes use of a result (discussed in Manning 2003, 2011) that for job-to-job quits there will be a relationship between the recruitment elasticity to this firm and the quit elasticity of the firms from which it recruits. The intuition is that one firm's quit is another firm's recruit. This result is derived under the assumption that when a worker has to choose between two firms, the wages influence choice only through the relative wage and do not depend on which firm the worker is currently employed in. Although many search models have this feature, it is important to be aware of the limitations of this result. First, the link between quit and recruitment elasticities is broken if the worker has a choice of more than two options as in the models with idiosyncrasy. And it is also broken if there are mobility costs so that the choice between two firms depends on which firm the worker is currently employed by. What this means is that it is probably important to have separate estimates of the recruitment elasticity. Some papers (e.g. Azar, Berry, and Marinescu 2019; Dal B6, Finan, and Rossi 2013) estimate the wage elasticity of applications though applications are not the same as recruits. Hirsch et al. (2021) show how the recruitment elasticity can be estimated using estimated fixed firm effects on wages.  \n\nWhile the recruitment elasticity is an important under-researched area, the rest of this paper discusses some estimates of separation functions.  \n\n## 6. The Estimation of Separation Rates  \n\nThe previous section has laid out the centrality of the elasticity of the separation rate with respect to the wage for understanding the extent of employer market power, whether that power is rooted in idiosyncrasy or frictions. There is a sizeable literature on estimating these elasticities; see the meta-study of Sokolova and Sorensen (2021). This literature has explored the level of the separation elasticity, and how it varies across demographic groups (e.g. gender or immigrant status); Manning (2021) provides a review of some of these studies.12  \n\nThe instantaneous separation rate is modelled as $e^{\\beta x}$ where $x$ are suitable controls, including the main variable of interest, the log wage. In most datasets, one only observes whether one is in the same job after some interval of time $t$ .This leads to a model for the probability of separating between the two observed quarters as  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(S=1\\left|x\\right.\\right)=e^{e^{\\beta x}t}.\n$$  \n\nThis is a complementary log-log model for the binary outcome of having a separation, which, compared to linear probability or logit models, has the advantage that it can be rooted in a hazard model and the estimated coefficients can be interpreted directly as the relevant elasticity.  \n\nIn estimating the wage elasticity of separations, it is obviously important to control adequately for other relevant factors. It is likely that separations depend on the wage in the current job relative to wages in plausible alternative jobs, perhaps proxied by characteristics of the worker that we know are relevant for the average level of wages. A failure to control for the alternative wage is likely to lead to a downward bias in the wage elasticities. On the other hand, separations are likely to be more sensitive to the permanent component of wages than to the part of wages that is a transitory shock or measurement error. In this case, the inclusion of controls correlated with the permanent wage is likely to reduce the estimated wage elasticity. In addition, Manning (2003, chap. 4) shows that unobserved heterogeneity in the separation rate will also cause a bias even if uncorrelated with the wage, because the model is a non-linear one.  \n\nIdeally, one would have exogenous variation in the wage and use this to estimate the separation elasticity. This is hard because one needs exogenous variation in wages at the firm level. The interest here is less in the estimate of the level of the separation elasticity but in how it varies. If the biases are constant, then the conclusions about his variation will be valid even if the level is not.  \n\nWe investigate the separation elasticity using data from the United Kingdom and the United States. For the United Kingdom, the data source is the UK Quarterly Labour Force Survey for 1997-2020. In this survey, addresses are sampled for five consecutive quarters with earnings information being asked in waves 1 and 5. For estimating the separation elasticity, we use the first-quarter data and estimate a model for the probability of leaving the current job by the time of the next quarter. For the United States, we use the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) for 1996-2016. This is a monthly survey so the model is estimated for the probability of leaving the current job in the next month.  \n\nFor both data sources, we use the log of the hourly wage as the measure of wages, and residualize it by estimating a standard earnings function using as controls age, gender, ethnicity, marital status and the number of dependent children, region, occupation, industry (both at the two-digit level), and (for the United Kingdom) whether the job is temporary. The residualized wage is the estimated residual from this regression and can be interpreted as an estimate of whether the job is high- or low-paying in a particular labour market (defined by the controls).  \n\nTABLE 1.

How the Separation Rate Varies with the Residualized Wage  \n\nThe first is how the separation rate varies with the residualized wage. This is an interesting question because it tells us about whether firms at the top or the bottom of the labour market facing more or less elastic labour supply. Webber (2015) found that employers have more monopsony power in the lower part of the earnings distribution. To this end, we define a categorical variable that rounds the residualized wage to the nearest $10\\log$ points, with all those more than 100 log points from the mean combined in categories. The fractions in each category are reported in Table 2.  \n\nTABLE 2.

The category is to the nearest log points.  \n\nFigure 1(a) presents the estimated log quit rate compared to the base category of beingwithin $+/{-100\\log}$ points of O together with the $95\\%$ confidence interval bands for the United Kingdom, while Figure 1(b) does the same for the United States. The slope of this relationship can be interpreted as the quit elasticity. Both countries have a similar shape: The relationship between the log separation and the wage is strongest in the middle of the distribution and weakest at the extremes. The implication is that employers at the bottom and top of the wage distribution have more monopsony power. This empirical finding is not in line with some of the canonical models used in the existing literature. For example, in the Burdett and Mortensen (1998) model, monopsony power falls as one moves up the wage distribution; in the simplest version of the model with no productivity differences across employers, this has to be the case in equilibrium as the highest wage firms have, by definition, the smallest gap between wages and marginal products. And in the multinomial logit model of idiosyncrasy where individual employers are infinitesimal, the elasticity is constant through the range. And, in models where they are not infinitesimal, the larger the firm is, the typically smaller the labour supply elasticity is (see, e.g., Berger, Herkenhoff, and  \n\n![](images/9d4ba8053db7d20c55fb185a15ad8aad34e1dd17698cd8ff37dd5150cd73d139.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1. (a): Log separations and residualized wage: United Kingdom. (b): Log separations and residualized wage: United States.  \n\nMongey 2019). But, the estimated relationship does make some sense if there is a wage below which almost no workers are prepared to work but also a natural limit to how many workers can be hired in the short-run whatever the wage paid.  \n\nThe shape of the relationship between the quit elasticity and the wage also has implications about pass-through from firm productivity to wages. If the labour supply elasticity is constant, then wages are a constant mark-down on productivity so passthrough is 1. If the elasticity falls as the wage rises, then pass-through will be less than 1 as is typically found in empirical studies (see, e.g., Howell and Brown 2020; Kline et al. 2019).  \n\n### 6.2. How the Separation Elasticity Varies with the Job Offer Arrival Rate  \n\nAs discussed previously, the impact of a changing job offer arrival rate on the monopsony power possessed by employers depends on whether quits to employment are more sensitive to wages than quits to unemployment. We can investigate this by considering how the probability of separations to employment varies with the wage. If the separation rate to employment is $q^{E}(w)$ and the separation rate to unemployment is $q^{U}(w)$ , then the share of quits to employment can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\gamma(w)=\\frac{q^{E}(w)}{q^{E}(w)+q^{U}(w)}=\\frac{e^{l n\\left[q^{E}(w)\\right]-l n\\left[q^{U}(w)\\right]}}{1+e^{l n\\left[q^{E}(w)\\right]-l n\\left[q^{U}(w)\\right]}}\n$$  \n\nso that how the share varies with the wage tells us about whether separations to employment or unemployment are more elastic. We estimate this model with a logit model, again using the categories of residualized wages. The estimated log odds ratio as a function of the residualized wage results is shown in Figure 2(a) for the United Kingdom and in Figure 2(b) for the United States.  \n\nFor both countries, the shape is the same. The fact that the log odds are increasing in the residualized wage implies that that separations to employment are less sensitive to the wage than quits to unemployment.13 This is the opposite of what is predicted from the Burdett-Mortensen model (1998). This relationship is strongest in the middle part of the wage distribution and weak at the top. If separations to employment are less sensitive to the wage, then anything that increases the job offer arrival rate is likely to increase monopsony power as it increases the share of separations to employment.  \n\nThe finding that separations to employment have a lower wage elasticity than separations to non-employment is not common across all studies; for example, Bassier, Dube and Naidu (2020) find the opposite result. And one conceptual problem is that the models used only have voluntary, not involuntary, separations (i.e. firing). If, as is plausible, firing is more common among low-wage workers, then this will make separations to non-employment more sensitive to the wage, but it is not clear whether this should be included in computations of the elasticity of the labour supply curve facing a firm. How to think about involuntary separations in these models remains on the“to do list\".  \n\n![](images/4a5af4ea189be683fa7ada04130e6bf1e5a6d3abd1805a37df31545355432a94.jpg)  \nFIGURE 2. (a): Estimated log odds of probability of separation to employment: United Kingdom. (b): Estimated log odds of probability of separation to employment: United States.  \n\nSome studies directly consider how the separation elasticity varies over the business cycle with both Hirsch, Jahn, and Schnabel (2018) and Bassier, Dube, and Naidu (2020) reporting evidence that the separation elasticity is higher in booms.  \n\n### 6.3. How the Separation Elasticity Varies over Time  \n\nThere is a concern, particularly in the United States (see, e.g., Philippon 2019), that markets (primarily product markets) have been becoming less competitive over time and that this can account for, among other things, the decline in the labour share in the United States. Stansbury and Summers (2020) argue that declining worker power is a better explanation of these trends, though this is seen as a result of the decline in institutions that give workers some power to share rents rather than the labour market becoming less competitive. The importance of institutions is also emphasized by Bivens, Mishel, and Schmitt (2018), and Rinz (2018) finds no evidence that concentration ratios in labour markets have been rising.14 Bell, Bukowski, and Machin (2018) find a lower level of rent-sharing over time in the United Kingdom. None of these studies considers trends in separation elasticities: Hirsch, Jahn and Schnabel (2018) do for Germany and find evidence of cyclicality but no trend. In this section, we consider how the separation elasticity has varied over time in the United Kingdom and the United States.  \n\nBecause it is hard to keep track of trends in the categories of residualized wages, we simply use the log residualized wage as a regressor and estimate year by year for the period 1997-2018 for the United Kingdom and 1996-2016 for the United States. Figure 3(a) shows the estimated value of the separation elasticity for the United Kingdom and Figure 3(b) for the United States, multiplied by $^{-1}$ (so it is a positive number). The separation elasticity has been becoming less negative over time in both countries, indicative of rising monopsony power.  \n\nA quantitative estimate of this trend is presented in Table 3. The years are pooled together, the same controls are used as for the previous separation models, and an interaction of the residualized log wage with year is included. This coefficient is multiplied by 10 to give an estimate of the change over a decade and centred on the year 2000 so the linear term can be thought of as an estimate in that year.  \n\nThe first column of Table 3 shows the estimate without a trend, while the second column shows the inclusion of the trend, which is significantly different from O. The natural next question is: \"Why?\" The first possible explanation is demographic change. Although the controls allow for characteristics to affect the level of separations, they may also affect the wage elasticity of separations. To investigate this, column 3 of  \n\n![](images/695ab219472ce60fb3ad00278444e7da158c2adf362a84b504d225eff19c77b7.jpg)  \nFIGURE 3. (a): Changing separations elasticity over time: United Kingdom. (b): Changing separations elasticity over time: United States.  \n\nTable 3 includes interactions with other covariates. Some of these other interactions are significant, implying that the separation elasticity varies with demographics. This is not always in the direction one might expect; for example, men in both the United Kingdom and the United States are estimated to have lower separation elasticities than women. And there are some differences between the countries; for example, the lowest education group has the highest estimated elasticity in the United Kingdom but the lowest in the United States. However, the significant trend is robust to allowing for differences in separation elasticities across demographic groups.  \n\n\\*\\*UU \\*\\*\\*   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"11\">US-SIPP</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"></td><td rowspan=\"3\">5 -0.308***</td><td>-0.344*** (0.005)</td><td colspan=\"3\">0.064***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">-3.765*** 6,421,560 (0.094) 1.558*** 0.078*** (0.017) (0.130) 452,582</td></tr><tr><td>(0.004) -0.351***</td><td colspan=\"3\">-0.021*** 0.113*** -0.115*** -0.119*** -0.101*** (0.008) (0.021) (0.029) (0.028) (0.034) 0.040</td></tr><tr><td>UK-QLFS</td><td rowspan=\"5\">(0.028)</td><td rowspan=\"5\"></td><td colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"5\"></td><td rowspan=\"5\">0.086*** (0.016)</td><td rowspan=\"5\">1.569*** (0.130) 452,582 -1.576*** (0.130) 452,582</td></tr><tr><td>0.013)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.414***</td></tr><tr><td>-0.370*** (0.011)</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Residualized wage</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n1\\*\\*S0'0> d \\* '10:0>d  \n\nSo, the decline in the separation elasticity does not seem to be the consequence of changing demographics. The explanation for separations becoming less sensitive to the wage is not entirely clear and is not found in all other studies. But, it could be one further aspect of the declining dynamism in labour markets, which has been documented elsewhere (e.g. Molloy et al. 2016).  \n\n## 7. Policies to Address Monopsony Power  \n\nIf monopsony power is pervasive (and perhaps increasing over time), then we should think about policies to address it.  \n\nMonopsony is most often mentioned when discussing the minimum wage. A minimum wage can address monopsony by preventing employers from converting their market power into lower wages. The minimum wage has its place but is inevitably a blunt instrument and can only address ssues of monopsony power at the bottom part of the labour market, while the evidence suggests monopsony power is more pervasive. So, some other policy tools are necessary.  \n\nAs monopsony is about competition in labour markets, it is natural to consider the use of competition policy to address the problems of monopsony, that is, to use the state as a source of counter-vailing power. On paper, the anti-trust laws of many countries treat competition in labour and product markets symmetrically. The practice is different; for example, Shapiro (2019) points out that no mergers in the United States have been blocked because of the impact on competition in the labour market. But, it may be that more thought needs to be given to how to apply competition policy in labour markets; for example, industry may be an appropriate way of thinking about product market competition, but many labour markets cut across product markets (though there are exceptions e.g. in healthcare and airlines), and labour markets are much more local than product markets (Manning and Petrongolo 2017). There are currently many proposals about how to correct the “historic imbalance” (Naidu, Posner, and Weyl 2018) between competition policy in product and labour markets (see, e.g., Krueger and Posner 2018; Marinescu and Hovenkamp 2019; Marinescu and Posner 2019; Naidu, Posner, and Weyl 2018).  \n\nMost competition laws prohibit collusive anti-competitive behaviour among employers, but there are serious questions about how much this has been enforced. Adam Smith (1970) had the view that employers “are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate. To violate this combination is everywhere a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours and equals\". And... “\"We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combination of masters; though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject.? Some recent cases involving high-profile companies15 have made us aware that these are current and not just historic problems.  \n\nMore thought also needs to be put in the regulation of employment contracts. The aspect of this that has probably received the most attention is non-competes (sometimes also called restrictive covenants), clauses that limit the ability of workers leaving firms to work for other firms, typically in the same field or area for a limited period (see, e.g. Krueger and Ashenfelter 2018; Marx 2011; Prescott, Bishara, and Starr 2016; Starr, Prescott, and Bishara 2019).  \n\nRestrictions on allowable labour contracts can be justified because they reduce the monopsony power of employers. Manning (2003) shows that if one mandates minimum standards that are normal goods, then this has the impact of raising worker utility and efficiency in a monopsonistic labour market because it raises the elasticity of the labour supply curve to the firm reducing monopsony power.  \n\nRestrictions on allowable contracts could also be justified by the argument that there are externalities; the possible future employers of a worker may have an interest unrepresented in any negotiations between the worker and their current employer. If a clause in my employment contract limits my ability to move to other employers, then that may make their labour supply less elastic, leading to more monopsony power in the labour market as a whole.  \n\nBut, over and above these justifications for restricting allowable labour contracts are questions about whether any contract agreed between two consenting parties should be enforceable. The economists’ approach is often that if the agreement is voluntary, then there is a presumption that both parties are better off because they are the best judge of their own welfare. But, there are questions about the circumstances in which this is a reasonable approximation to reality (not just in labour markets-see Schoar 2021). Economists are often happy to assume that people differ in their ability when modelling wage inequality but, with the exception of behavioural economics, much more reluctant to assume that people differ in their ability to maximize their utility. For a discipline that prides itself on its logical consistency, this does seem something of an oversight. And it has important implications about the view of the merits of voluntary trade between agents who may differ in their decision-making abilities. Problems may often occur where we have interactions between what we might call amateurs and professionals. An employer will have many more workers than a typical worker has employers so the employer might be expected to be more skilled (and have more incentives to become more skilled) in manipulating the terms of the employment contract to their advantage and to the disadvantage of workers. One possible example of this is that workers may not always read the “small print’ of the contracts they are signing: Lipsitz and Starr (2021) show larger effects of non-competes on labour mobility and reductions in wages when they are presented to workers after accepting the job offer.  \n\nThe current attitude to the details of labour contracts is very different from the attitude taken in product markets. For example, we would not dream to allow my current supermarket to only sell to me on the condition that if I want to do my grocery shopping elsewhere, I can only shop in more distant shops. Yet, in the United Kingdom, it has been ruled acceptable for the employer of a hairdresser to restrict their ability to work for other hairdressers within half a mile. That may not sound like a very restrictive condition, but, according to the Labour Force Survey, $25\\%$ of hairdressers have a commute of less than 5 minutes and $50\\%$ less than 10 minutes. Labour markets are very local so these restrictions may be considerable. One way of thinking about these restrictive covenants is that employers are seeking to appropriate the human capital of workers (see Lobel 2013, for a wider discussion of these issues).  \n\nAnother example would be notice periods, which increase the amount of time it takes for workers to change jobs. As these are switching/mobility costs, one would expect them to increase frictions in the labour market, making it less competitive. In product markets, competition policy often seeks to reduce or eliminate switching costs. In the labour market, we accept them as normal; it may be that there are procompetitive justifications, but the important point is that we do not consider the issue atall.  \n\nUsing the power of the state to set minimum wages and regulate employment contracts is important but has its limitations as they are inevitably blunt instruments and there is a limit to the effectiveness of “top-down\" policies when enforcement may be difficult. There is also a potentially important role for “bottom-up” policies to give counter-vailing power of workers through trade unions or worker board-level representation. There is a recent resurgence of interest in this area (see Jager, Schoefer, and Heining 2021, for a recent assessment of German co-determination) though more needstobedone.  \n\n## 8. Conclusions  \n\nAs the idea that employers have considerable market power over their workers comes to be widely accepted, we need to have measures of the extent of that power, how it varies within and across labour markets, how it has changed over time, and what can be done to address the problems it causes. While this paper has offered some views on many of these issues, there is much more that needs to be done. And it does need to be done if economists are to make sure that our economy works for the benefit of all.  \n\n## Appendix A. The Effort Determination Model  \n\nWe first show how equation (5) implies that $\\partial e/\\partial w\\geq0$ . Differentiating equation (5) leads to  \n\n$$\np^{\\prime\\prime}(e)\\left[w-e\\right]{\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w}}+p^{\\prime}(e)\\left[1-{\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w}}\\right]=\\beta\\left[p^{\\prime}(e){\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w}}-1\\right].\n$$  \n\nRe-arranging equation (A.1) leads to  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w}=\\frac{p^{\\prime}+\\beta}{p^{\\prime}+\\beta p^{\\prime}-p^{\\prime\\prime}\\left[w-e\\right]}.\n$$  \n\nThe denominator must be positive from the second-order condition, so this implies $\\partial e/\\partial w\\geq0$  \n\nComparing equations (5) and (6), we also have that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{p^{\\prime}}{\\beta}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{N u}}\\left[\\frac{1-p^{\\prime}\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w}}{1-\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w}}\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhich can be re-arranged to give  \n\n$$\np^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w}+\\varepsilon_{N u}\\left(1-\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w}\\right)}.\n$$  \n\nWe are interested in the case where $\\beta>\\varepsilon_{N u}$ and will show that this implies $p^{\\prime}>1$ . Suppose that not $p^{\\prime}\\leq1$ . From equation (A.4), this can only be the case if $\\partial e/\\partial w>1.$ Equation (A.2) then implies that $p^{\\prime}<1$ , a contradiction. This then implies that $\\partial e/\\partial w<1$  \n\n## Appendix B. Deriving the Mark-Down in the Simple Dynamic Model  \n\nTaking the first-order condition of equation (7) with respect to $w$ and taking account of the dependence of $N_{t}$ on $w$ leads to the first-order condition  \n\n$$\n[p-w+\\beta\\Pi^{\\prime}(N_{t})]{\\frac{\\partial N_{t}}{\\partial w}}=N_{t}.\n$$  \n\nWe also have the envelope condition that allows us to derive the derivative of the value function. Differentiating equation (7), we have that  \n\n$$\n\\Pi^{\\prime}(N_{t-1})=\\left[p-w+\\beta\\Pi^{\\prime}(N_{t})\\right]\\frac{\\partial N_{t}}{\\partial N_{t-1}}=[p-w+\\beta\\Pi^{\\prime}(N_{t})](1-q).\n$$  \n\nIn a steady-state16 where wages and employment are constant, we can solve equation (B.2) for $\\Pi^{\\prime}(N)$ ,which leads to  \n\n$$\n\\Pi^{\\prime}(N)=\\frac{\\left(1-q\\right)\\left(p-w\\right)}{1-\\beta\\left(1-q\\right)}.\n$$  \n\nSubstituting equation (B.3) into equation (B.1) and re-arranging leads to  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(p-w\\right)}{1-\\beta\\left(1-q\\right)}\\frac{\\partial N_{t}}{\\partial w}=N_{t}.\n$$  \n\nBy differentiating equation (8), we have that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial N_{t}}{\\partial w^{\\prime}}=R^{\\prime}(w^{\\prime})-q^{\\prime}(w^{\\prime})N_{t-1}.\n$$  \n\nIn a steady-state, equation (B.5) can be written as  \n\n$$\nw\\frac{\\partial N_{t}}{\\partial w}=R\\varepsilon_{R w}-q N\\varepsilon_{q w}=q N(\\varepsilon_{R w}-\\varepsilon_{q w}).\n$$  \n\nSubstituting equation (B.6) into equation (B.4) then leads to equation (9).  \n\n## Appendix C. Proof of Proposition about the Quit Elasticity  \n\nDifferentiating equation (14), we have that  \n\n$$\nq^{\\prime}(w)=-[(1-\\lambda)G_{X X}+\\lambda H_{X X}]X^{\\prime}(w).\n$$  \n\nFrom equation (10), we have that  \n\n$$\nX^{\\prime}(w)=u^{\\prime}(w)+\\beta_{w}\\frac{\\partial w^{\\prime}}{\\partial w}V^{\\prime}(w^{\\prime}(w)),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\partial w^{\\prime}/\\partial w$ is a measure of how much the future wage is expected to change when the current wage changes. Denote this derivative by $\\varphi$ . And from equation (13), we have  \n\n$$\nV^{\\prime}(w)=[(1-\\lambda)G_{X}+\\lambda H_{X}]X^{\\prime}(w).\n$$  \n\nCombining equations (C.2) and (C.3), and using equation (14), we can derive  \n\n$$\nX^{\\prime}(w)=\\frac{u^{\\prime}(w)}{1-\\beta_{w}\\varphi\\left[1-q(w)\\right]}.\n$$  \n\nThis has the intuition that workers discount the wages paid by this firm by their discount factor times the probability they remain with the firm. If the quit rate is very high, then an increase in wages is worth less to the workers. Substituting equation (C.4) into equation (C.1), the elasticity can be expressed as  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{q w}=-\\frac{[(1-\\lambda)G_{X X}+\\lambda H_{X X}]}{[(1-\\lambda)(1-G_{X})+\\lambda(1-H_{X})]}\\frac{w u^{\\prime}(w)}{1-\\beta_{w}\\varphi[1-q(w)]}.\n$$  \n\nEquation (C.5) can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{q w}=-\\left[\\alpha\\frac{G_{X X}}{\\left(1-G_{X}\\right)}+\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)\\frac{H_{X X}}{\\left(1-H_{X}\\right)}\\right]\\frac{w u^{\\prime}(w)}{1-\\beta_{w}\\varphi\\left[1-q(w)\\right]},\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\frac{(1-\\lambda)G_{X}}{[(1-\\lambda)(1-G_{X})+\\lambda(1-H_{X})]},\n$$  \n\nthat is, the share of quits who did not have another job offer. Using equation (15), this proves the proposition.  \n\n## References  \n\nADel, Wll, Slivana ienreyro, ana Uregory 1nwates (zUi8). Monopsony m tne UK.

Using the labor market peer measure, I examine whether firms that hire employees with similar skills and that are presumably exposed to the same labor-related risks and shocks exhibit a strong comovement of stock returns and accounting-based performance variables. I find that labor market peers overlap but differ from traditional product-market-based industry groupings, have significant incremental power to explain stock return and accounting-based performance measure comovements, and outperform traditional industry groupings in explaining return and wage comovements when a base firm shares more labor skills with its peers. Overall, the study highlights that labor market peers capture fundamental linkages between firms that are challenging to identify using traditional industry measures.  \n\nKeywords Peer firms $\\cdot$ Labor market $\\cdot$ Industry classification $\\cdot$ Online search $\\cdot$ LinkedIn $\\cdot$ Glassdoor $\\cdot$ Benchmarking  \n\nJEL Classification $\\mathrm{D}83\\cdot\\mathrm{G}0\\cdot\\mathrm{J}01\\cdot\\mathrm{M}2$  \n\nFlying on the Delta Shuttle with Bill Gates 12 years ago, I asked, “ What Microsoftcompetitorworriesyoumost?\" \"Goldman Sachs.\" I gave Gates a startled look.

Most of this effort has focused on defining industries for benchmarking and on identifying groups of peers. Standard industry groupings are primarily based on product-market relations and measure output market linkages but not necessarily input market linkages. Labor inputs play an increasingly important role in driving firm performance and economic growth (Becker 1962). Although such firms as Microsoft and Goldman Sachs hire similar types of labor and face common input risks, their linkages may be overlooked because they are not in the same product market. This paper proposes a new approach for identifying labor market peer firms by analyzing \"also viewed\" firms on online labor markets Glassdoor and LinkedIn. The results suggest that labor market peers capture economic linkages that are not captured by traditional industry groupings and have incremental power in explaining stock returns and accounting-based performance variable comovements. This suggests that labor market connections are economically significant in transmitting risks and shocks to firm performance and stock returns. Additionally, labor market peers are found to help explain the selection of peers for CEO compensation benchmarking, highlighting the importance of considering labor market connections in economic and financial analyses.  \n\nWhy do labor market peers offer incremental power over standard industry groupings in identifying firms’ economic linkages? First, these peers represent common human-capital risk and can help identify demand and supply shocks to a firm's talent pool that standard industry groupings cannot.2 Limits on labor can raise wages and impede a firm's production of goods. For example, technology shocks to new firms likely increase the demand for certain types of employees, leading to a labor demand shock (Bresnahan et al. 2002). Therefore shareholders require a risk premium for the threat of losing key talent (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou 2013). Changes in immigration policy (Bernstein et al. 2022) and increased occupational licensing requirements (Barrios 2022) can also reduce the supply of labor and increase wage premiums. Examining labor market peers can help identify these common shocks, even when the affected firms do not operate in the same product market.  \n\nSecond, labor market peers can help capture shared production risks and shocks, as firms that hire similar types of employees may have similar production processes and inputs. For example, chemical manufacturers and oil-and-gas companies both use chemical processes to transform raw materials into products for intermediate or final consumption. These firms are exposed to common input price volatilities and technological advancements that may affect production costs. They may also face common regulatory and capital market risks, due to their environmental impacts. Identifying this type of commonality can be challenging because these companies operate in different product markets.? However, overlaps in their labor markets can illuminate commonalities because both types of firms may hire chemical and mechanical engineers to develop new products, material scientists to optimize production, and financial analysts to help hedge the price fuctuations of raw materials.  \n\nThird, labor market peers can also capture output market shocks, as firms in the same product market may hire similar kinds of workers. Thus it is natural for a firm's labor market and product market peers to overlap. I don't focus on labor market peers? ability to capture output market shocks and use traditional industry peers to control for product market shocks.  \n\nTo examine the incremental explanatory power of labor market peers over traditional industry groupings in identifying firms’ economic linkages, I analyze the comovement of stock returns and earnings-based measures. Firms in the same product market are exposed to similar output market shocks that affect their revenues, while firms using the same inputs, including labor, experience similar input market shocks that affect expenses. These shocks, which can include exogenous one-time shocks, changes in risk factors, or a combination of these, can significantly impact firms’′ stock prices. When firms are exposed to common shocks, their stock prices and earnings are likely to comove. In a stylized model, I show that, when labor market peers hire similar types of employees and are subject to similar labor shocks, their earnings are more likely to comove. The strength of this comovement increases as the peers share more types of labor. While it is difficult to directly identify or observe shocks, I use tests of stock return and earnings comovement to infer the channels through which shocks affect firm value. The incremental explanatory power of labor market peers over standard industry groupings suggests that the labor markets capture important input shocks.  \n\nIdentifying connections between firms in the labor market can be difficult, due to the limited information that firms disclose about their labor. Data on employment histories from sources such as the Census are not publicly available, and this limits the types of questions that can be answered using these data. However, the emergence of online labor markets has provided a new opportunity to study labor market activities (Horton and Tambe 2015). These sites offer a wealth of data that can be used to better understand the linkages between firms in the labor market.  \n\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to identify labor market peers by examining \"also viewed firms on LinkedIn and Glassdoor. LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network, with more than 700 million members and 50 million companies worldwide as of 2020. Its members create online profiles and build professional networks on this platform. They use LinkedIn to research companies and explore career opportunities. They can also access job postings, information about corporate culture, and insights about firms’ business prospects. At the time of data collection, for each firm on LinkedIn, the site shows six other firms that members “also viewed.\"\"  \n\nFor example, members who “viewed\" Tesla “also viewed\" BMW, Ford, Solar City, Space Exploration Technologies, Google, and Apple on LinkedIn. While the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code would identify BMW and Ford as Tesla's peers, it would not consider Google and Apple, even though they are important peers for Tesla, due to their hiring of similar types of labor. The “also viewed\" firms are based on LinkedIn's item-to-item collaborative filtering platform, where a variety of factors are considered and the top-N peer firms are presented.  \n\nTo further validate the concept of identifying labor market peers based on employee \"also viewed\" patterns, I apply this approach to Glassdoor.com, an employee review and recruitment website. For each company, Glassdoor lists the top 12 firms “job seekers also viewed.\" For example, those interested in Amazon “also viewed\" Walmart; tech companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM; the financial services company American Express; and the delivery service company UPS.  \n\nI classify the “also viewed\" firms on LinkedIn and Glassdoor as the base firm's labor market peers. Considering that the display of “also viewed\" companies aims to enhance user engagement and recommend content, and given the career-oriented nature of both LinkedIn and Glassdoor platforms, I expect the “also viewed\" firms to reflect firms’ labor market connections. Further details on the “also viewed”’ algorithm and measurement errors are discussed in Section 3.1.  \n\nLabor market peers identified from LinkedIn and Glassdoor both capture a firm's connections in the labor market. Approximately $72\\%$ of the base firms in my sample have overlapping LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers. Among these base firms, on average, $49\\%$ of a base firm's LinkedIn labor market peers are also identified as peers by Glassdoor. In addition to analyzing the LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers, I form a more comprehensive set of labor market peers based on the union of the LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers and a core set of peers based on the intersection of the LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers. This approach allows me to cross-validate the results obtained from the two platforms and provide a more comprehensive understanding of firms’ labor market connections.  \n\nIn this paper, I name the labor market peer measure the LMP and host the data for download on an external website. The LMP measure can identify commonalities between firms that traditional industry groupings cannot. For the union of the LinkedIn and Glassdoor labor market peers, $53\\%$ of the peers for S&P 1500 firms come from firms in different six-digit GICS industries and $70\\%$ come from firms in different four-digit SIC industries. The intersection sample exhibits less but still significant differences: $29\\%$ of S&P 1500 firms’ labor market peers are from firms in different six-digit GICS industries, and $54\\%$ are from firms in different four-digit SIC industries. This illustrates that labor market peers capture commonalities beyond the traditional output market.  \n\nI find that the LMP measure has economically significant and meaningful incremental power in explaining stock return comovements over standard industry groupings (SIC, NAICS, GICS) and text-based product market industry groupings (TNIC, Hoberg and Phillips 2010, 2016). While traditional industry groupings can explain an averageof $18.1\\%$ of the cross-sectional variation in returns, labor market peers on average increases this explanatory power to $20.8\\%$ ,a $14.9\\%$ increase.Evidence from accounting-based comovement tests suggests that the LMP measure also has incremental power over standard industry groupings in explaining contemporaneous correlations in accounting-based performance measures, including valuation multiples, profitability, and expense ratios.  \n\nI also investigate whether there is a relationship between the strength of the LMP measure and the degree of a base firm's labor market connections. I sort the base firms into terciles based on their percentage of shared labor skills with their peers. My analysis shows that the LMP measure offers a higher explanatory power for stock returns when the base firm shares more labor skills with its peers. On average, it explains $22.5\\%$ of the cross-sectional variation in returns for the group of firms that share the highest proportion of labor skills, while it only explains $4.7\\%$ for the group that shares the least. My analysis also shows that the LMP measure has higher explanatory power for employee wages when the base firm has greater labor market connections with peers. On average, it explains $57.9\\%$ of the cross-sectional variation in wages for the group of firms that share the most labor skills, while it only explains $22.3\\%$ for the group that shares the fewest skills. Moreover, the measure significantly outperforms traditional industry classifications only when firms share a higher proportion of labor skills, suggesting that labor market peers do better than traditional industry measures at capturing firms' labor market connections.  \n\nNext, to demonstrate the practical implications of the LMP measure, beyond identifying labor market links that drive stock return comovements, I examine, in online appendix, whether the measure helps explain the selection of compensation benchmarking peers. I find that a firm's labor market peers are more likely to be chosen as compensation peers, even when controlling for such factors as industry, size, talent fow, peer pay level, and other factors that have been shown to influence the selection of compensation peers. CEO pay at labor market peers also helps explain the median CEO pay of a firm's compensation benchmarking peers and, as a result, the pay of the base firm's CEO. This suggests that the LMP measure can provide valuable insights into factors that influence compensation benchmarking.  \n\nAlthough traditional industry classifications, such as SIC or GICS, are convenient for research, they have limitations. First, traditional industry classifications impose transitivity, requiring that, if firms B and C are in firm A's industry, then B and C are also in the same industry. Thus traditional industry classifications tend to mix closely and remotely related firms. The LMP measure relaxes the transitivity requirement and likely identifies firms most relevant peers and crucial linkages from a potentially noisy large sample of industry peers. Second, traditional industry groupings are relatively static. Labor market peers, however, are the outcome of real-time employee searches and are more likely to reflect firms’ changing economic conditions. Third, no standard industry grouping easily incorporates employees? perspectives, though employees are industry and corporate insiders.  \n\nIn sum, this study presents initial evidence that labor market peers, identified through “also viewed\" firms on Glassdoor and LinkedIn, capture important labor market connections not captured by traditional industry groupings.  \n\nMy approach also has limitations. First, the algorithm used to identify labor market peers is proprietary to the online platforms. Second, the peers identified through this approach may be influenced by LinkedIn and Glassdoor user demographics and firm activities on the platforms. As such, the LMP measure should be used cautiously for policy making. Third, labor market peers based on LinkedIn and Glassdoor “also viewed’ firms likely capture a firm's most relevant peers but may miss other less related firms. Despite these limitations, the concept of extracting labor market connections between firms using employees? online browsing histories can be extended to various online labor markets, offering an alternative to traditional industry peers.  \n\nThis paper makes several contributions. First, the primary contribution is to the peer selection and industry classification literature (see Section 2). To my knowledge, this paper is among the first to group firms based on labor market similarities and to provide a measure of labor market peers. The economic significance of the input market linkages to firms is not well understood, due to lack of good measure of these linkages. However, the issue is important, given that labor is a critical and scarce resource for many modern firms, especially as the world shifts to a talent economy (Martin 2014). I show that these relations transmit shocks to stock returns and firm performance and represent an important human capital risk. The LMP measure has potential applications in diverse areas, such as benchmarking in performance evaluation and human capital management.  \n\nSecond, this paper contributes to the budding area of accounting, finance, and labor. Recent studies examine the impact of accounting and financial policies, such as financial distress (Brown and Matsa 2016) and financial misreporting (Choi and Gipper 2019; Teoh et al. 2023), on the labor market. It is challenging to use traditional industry peers to measure the scope of impact, as product and labor markets do not always overlap. This study should help future studies that examine specific labormarket impacts of corporate events and policies.  \n\nThird, this paper contributes to the growing body of literature that underscores the latent intelligence found in internet users’ online activities, an area that has garnered considerable attention from academics and practitioners. Studies have used aggregate search trends and browsing histories to predict house prices (Wu and Brynjolfsson 2009), stock prices (Da et al. 2011), stock comovement (Lee et al. 2015; Leung et al. 2017), and employee turnover (Dehaan et al. 2023). This paper shows how the online activities of a specific group-employees-reveal firms’ fundamental connections. It also contributes to the growing body of research on how information technology reshapes a firm's information environment (Blankespoor et al. 2013; Miller and Skinner 2015; Lee et al. 2015; Jung et al. 2018; Teoh 2018; Chiu et al. 2023).  \n\nSection 2 discusses related literature. Section 3 describes the data and provides summary statistics for the LMP measure. Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 performs additional analyses and robustness tests. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n# 2 Related literature on industry and peer firm groupings  \n\nPractitioners and academic researchers identify industry classifications and peer firms for many purposes, including equity valuation (Brown and Ball 1967; King 1966; Fama and French 1997; Bhojraj et al. 2003; De Franco et al. 2015), executive compensation (Albuquerque 2009), corporate financial policy (Rauh and Sufi 2012; Leary and  \n\nRoberts 2014), information transfers (Foster 1981; Ramnath 2002; Cohen and Frazzini 2008), and risk management. Industry groupings are also essential for understanding vertical and horizontal integration in industrial organizations (Fan and Lang 2000; Hoberg and Phillips 2010; Lee et al. 2019).  \n\nThree industry classifications-the SIC, NAICS, and GICS-are widely used by academics and practitioners in accounting, finance, and economics. The Standard Industry Classification (SIC) System was developed by the Central Statistical Board in the 1930s and last updated in 1987. It uses a demand-based conceptual framework, where establishments are grouped into industries based on the similarity of their product markets. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) replaced the SIC method in 1997 and uses a supply-based framework, where establishments are grouped into industries according to similarities in production processes. Although NAICS considers firms′ input commonalities, NAICS and SIC use similar data sources, and research shows that they have similar power to explain firms’ stock return comovement and financial multiples (Bhojraj et al. 2003). The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), developed by Standard & Poor's and MSCI in 1999, offers a market-oriented industry classification. Companies are classified based on their principal businesses and by the market perceptions revealed by investment research reports. Bhojraj et al. (2003) compare the different industry classifications and find that GICS outperforms SIC, NAICS, and the Fama and French 49-industry groupings (Fama and French 1997) in explaining contemporaneous correlations in stock returns.  \n\nText Network Industry Classification (TNIC) is a recent industry classification based on firm pairwise similarity scores from textual analysis of 10K product descriptions. TNIC is updated annually and offers more research flexibility than traditional industry classifications. Research shows that it improves upon SIC and NAICS codes in explaining firm characteristics, such as profitability (Hoberg and Phillips 2010, 2016). However, TNIC is still primarily based on product market similarities. I compare the incremental power of the LMP measure with the four existing industry classifications.  \n\nThis paper also relates to recent papers that identify peer firms through internet search patterns. Lee et al. (2015) identify peer firms using internet traffic on the EDGAR website, while Leung et al. (2017) identify peers using the online searches of individuals who visit Yahoo! Finance. These measures are based on investor perceptions and most likely work through a mix of fundamental and investor-sentiment channels. In contrast, labor market peers based on LinkedIn and Glassdoor data are less subject to investor sentiment and can capture new dimensions of production functions in the labor market.  \n\nLastly, this paper complements two recent studies that also examine firms’ labor market connections. All three papers construct novel measures of labor market peers, and all show that firms’ labor market connections differ from their product market connections. However, the three methods are distinct. Liu and Wu (2022) construct their peers based on a database of job postings and link firms based on the job postings? Occupational Information Network $\\mathrm{(O^{*}N E T)}$ codes. Their approach likely offers a comprehensive set of labor market peers but may classify remotely related or unrelated jobs as relatedbecause $\\mathsf{O}^{*}\\mathsf{N E T}$ codes may classify different jobs as related if they have the same job titles.4 Bae et al. (2022) build their measure based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics? Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey and $\\mathrm{O}^{\\ast}\\mathrm{NET^{\\ast}s}$ classification of occupational knowledge. This approach, while likely also offers a thorough analysis of labor market connections, but is constrained to an industry-level measure due to the nature of the OES data.  \n\nIn contrast, my approach is based on employees’ “also viewed\" patterns when they are researching companies on online labor market platforms. These patterns likely not only reflect labor demand information, such as job postings, but may also reflect information that affects labor supply and may incorporate employees? private information (Hales et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2020; Li et al. 2019). These sources of information are considered by employees but are likely unobservable to outsiders or researchers grouping firms. Thus Liu and Wu (2022) and Bae et al. (2022) likely capture a more comprehensive set of labor market peers, while the LMP measure in this paper likely captures a firm's most relevant labor market peers.  \n\n# 3 Data and measures  \n\n## 3.1 Data from online labor market \"also viewed\" firms  \n\nI assume that people primarily use online labor market platforms for career-related purposes. When company A is listed as company B's “also viewed\" firm on LinkedIn or Glassdoor, it is likely that both companies attract a similar pool of talents. As such, I classify these “also viewed\" firms as labor market peers.5 To construct the LMP measure, I use data from LinkedIn and Glassdoor, respectively. To ensure robustness and gain a deeper understanding of the measure, I create two additional samples: one based on the union of the LinkedIn and Glassdoor labor market peers, which likely captures a broader set of peers, and another based on the intersection of the LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers, which likely captures a core set of peers. I describe the data below.  \n\n### 3.1.1 Linkedln company page \"people also viewed\" data  \n\nLinkedIn is the world's largest online professional networking and recruiting site. Members, recruiters, and companies comprise of its users. There were more than 700 million members and 50 million companies listed on the site as of 2020. Members use  \n\nLinkedIn to build their professional profiles and networks, allowing them to interact with other users and discover new career opportunities. Companies use their LinkedIn pages for recruiting and branding. LinkedIn company homepages have subpages such as \"jobs,’ “life,” “people,” and “insights,” which provide members not only access to job postings but also information about a company's culture, professional development opportunities, employee distribution, and headcount growth based on LinkedIn data. Members can also learn whether any alumni or anyone in their network works at a company and connect with them for information or referrals. Recruiters on LinkedIn, for their part, can use filters to find candidates who have viewed their company page, indicating that recruiters consider these members to be potential employees.  \n\nLinkedIn features “People Also Viewed” companies, based on its item-to-item collaborative filtering program known as “browsemaps.\" This system uses members' browsing histories to build a latent graph of co-occurrences of entities, showcasing relationships between pairs of companies based on the aggregated behavior of many LinkedIn users. Browsemap powers many navigational aids on Linkedln and contributes a significant portion of traffic and engagement on the platform. The system uses techniques such as damping entities that are overly popular (e.g., preventing Google from being overly correlated throughout the ecosystem) and incorporating a form of hysteresis, where newer views are weighted more heavily than older ones. Figure 1 shows the interface of Dow's web page on LinkedIn including its “People Also Viewed” firms.6  \n\nThe “People Also Viewed\" feature on LinkedIn is likely determined by various factors, including counting the co-occurrences of views for different companies (Wu et al. 2014; LinkedIn 2022). LinkedIn may have considered such collaborative filtering features as co-follow or co-employed-at as well as content-based features, such as industry or location.7 Generally, I would expect labor market-related factors to reveal firms’ labor market connections, while nonlabor market-related factors to add noise and influence the outcome of the browsemap.  \n\nRecall that the aim of the “People Also Viewed\" browsemap is to serve as a navigational aid, enhance user engagement, and recommend relevant content. Given LinkedIn's career focus, labor market peer firms are considered suitable candidates to fulfill this purpose. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the possibility of measurement error and selection bias when interpreting the results obtained from the browsemap. I will further discuss these aspects in Sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.4.  \n\n![](images/32402493988b8340426cab889e2d61dd49092cbe52228b9f25f9e8a41c7eaf4c.jpg)  \n\n# Dow  \n\nWe'recelebrating125yearsofpartnership and dreaming bolderforamoresustainablefuture. #Dow125#lmagineBetter   \nChemical Manufacturing·Midland,Michigan·968,785followers  \n\n![](images/b638942dfb0d8503f743b47a127efbd9fe7c970dd4cf901c9b91f73bd685e9eb.jpg)  \n\nswsy 7 people from your company work here · 42,794 employees  \n\n# +Follow  \n\nVisit website（  \n\nMore  \n\nHome About Posts Jobs Life People Insights Events Videos  \n\n# About  \n\nWecombine global breadth;assetintegrationandscale;focusedinnovationandmaterialsscienceexpertise;leading business positions;and environmental, social and governance(ESG) leadership to achieve profitable growth and deliverasustainablefuture.Ourambitionistobecomethemostinnovative,customercentric,inclusivean.seemore  \n\n![](images/a1c3729523324dedb12bd2bcc421f0b529164e2a10973cac4d283364cb43d7ef.jpg)  \nFig. 1 Dow's LinkedIn homepage and “people also viewed\" peers  \n\nLinkedIn's internal applications demonstrate that LinkedIn engineers use the \\*“People Also Viewed\" company browsemap to identify labor market peers and assist recruiters and hiring managers in finding similarly qualified candidates in peer firms. One such application is the “Similar Profiles\" feature, which is a recommender system that pools similar candidates from “also viewed\" companies based on the current company of members viewed by recruiters and hiring managers. An A/B test showed that using the company-view browsemap alone increased profile reviews by morethan $30\\%$ (Wu et al. 2014). Another application, “Search by Ideal Candidates\"  \n\n(Ha-Thuc et al. 2016), constructs a company browsemap using co-viewing relationships to generate a set of companies that are likely to have candidates similar to the ideal candidates. These applications demonstrate that LinkedIn leverages the company-view browsemap, based on the idea that “People Also Viewed’” companies hire individuals with similar skills.  \n\n### 3.1.2 Glassdoor company page \"job seekers also viewed\" data  \n\nGlassdoor is a leading review and recruitment website, founded in 2007. Current and former employees can anonymously write reviews about corporate culture, career opportunities, and salaries on the website. This information is not easily available elsewhere, making Glassdoor useful for both current employees and job seekers. Glassdoor also hosts job postings, and employees can apply for jobs on Glassdoor. As of 2021, Glassdoor had 67 million unique monthly visitors to its website and mobile app and hosted company homepages and job openings.8  \n\nGlassdoor lists “Job Seekers Also Viewed\" firms on its company homepages. According to inquiry with Glassdoor, this feature was based on the analysis of jobclicking by users during my sample period. Two employers are considered related in the labor market if the same user clicks on jobs for both. The top 12 firms of a given firm's “Job Seekers Also Viewed\" firms are listed on the Glassdoor company homepage (Chen-Zion 2015). Over time, the feature expanded to include co-views of other employer pages on Glassdoor, such as employer review pages and salary pages, as of July 2023. I classify these firms as Glassdoor labor market peers. Figure 2 shows the interface of Amazon's web page on Glassdoor and the 12 “Job Seekers Also Viewed’' firms. Karabarbounis and Pinto (2018) found that the wage distribution from Glassdoor reviews resembles that based on U.S. Census data and industries are widely represented on Glassdoor, although certain industries are more represented than others. Further discussion of Glassdoor's contents, user demographics, and user incentives can be found in the work of Hales et al. (2018); Huang et al. (2020); Marinescu et al. (2021); Dehaan et al. (2023).  \n\n### 3.1.3 Measurement error  \n\nThe assumption of constructing peer firms based on LinkedIn and Glassdoor's “also viewed'”’ data is that members primarily use online labor market platforms for careerrelated purposes and the platforms optimize their algorithms to serve this purpose effectively. Thus measurement noise may arise if members use LinkedIn and Glassdoor for other purposes or if nonlabor market factors are used in the construction of “also viewed'firms.  \n\nThe first type of noise is generated when LinkedIn users perform noncareerrelated activities on the platform. According to LinkedIn, the second-largest and fastest-growing activity on its site is B2B marketing. As a result, LinkedIn users may view company profiles for lead generation or to contact people who work for their customers or suppliers.9  \n\n![](images/c40da4c59aa04b06ce59b183c1c92156c09bafbbdb5a5aa9522db9147d7a9d2a.jpg)  \nFig. 2 Amazon's Glassdoor homepage and \"job seekers also viewed\" peers  \n\nThe second type of noncareer-related activity is using LinkedIn or Glassdoor for leisure purposes. For example, LinkedIn members might connect with people they meet locally, view those people's employers out of curiosity, and use LinkedIn for communication. I address the measurement error issues in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2.  \n\nThe third source of noise arises from nonlabor market factors incorporated in the \"also viewed\"’ firms algorithm. For instance, the algorithm may consider standard industry classification similarity as a factor. It is essential to acknowledge that there are natural overlaps between a firm's product-market and labor-market peers, and including this factor could enhance the algorithm's performance. However, the downside is that nonlabor-related product market peers may introduce noise to the algorithm. To address the potential influence of product market peers, I employ standard industry measures as controls for the empirical tests.  \n\n### 3.1.4 Selection bias  \n\nAs labor market peers reflect the aggregate behavior of LinkedIn or Glassdoor users, user demographics, firm representation, and how users and firms use the platform would affect their composition.  \n\nFirst, this composition likely depends on who uses LinkedIn and Glassdoor. Notably, $51\\%$ of LinkedIn members have a college degree, as compared to $35\\%$ based on the most recent U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS).10 These numbers indicate that the employees recruited on LinkedIn are likely the essential labor for the firm and the pool of talent that is in scarce supply. As such, the labor market peers identified through LinkedIn and Glassdoor should be interpreted as a firm's critical peers, and it is unclear whether the results would differ for the types of employees who do not use LinkedIn or Glassdoor.  \n\nSecond, the composition of labor market peers may also depend on firm representation and how firms choose to use the sites. For example, certain industries are more represented on the sites than others (Karabarbounis and Pinto 2018), and this may affect relative web traffic. In addition, firm size may also affect the composition of labor market peers. Big firms likely attract more web traffic, are better known, and may have more accurate labor market peers. Small ones have less web traffic but may still attract interested users because they are likely less well known and have fewer alternative information channels. Sections 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 discusses several robustness tests that further examine this issue.  \n\n## 3.2 Sample selection  \n\nThe base sample of firms is the S&P 1500 universe as of January 2013. Table 1 panel A describes sample selection. In July 2013, I searched LinkedIn for each firm in the S&P 1500 and found LinkedIn homepages for 1,464 unique firms, of which 1,456 firms had the “People Also Viewed\"” company browsemap. I collected the “People Also Viewed'\" firms for each company and manually matched them with firms in the CRSP/Compustat database. This resulted in 5,419 unique peer firms, including 3,366 U.S. public firms. Private and foreign peer firms were excluded due to data availability. I further restricted my sample to firms that could be matched with Compustat and were listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or AMEX trading with ordinary common shares (CRSP share code of 10 or 11). This resulted in 1,325 base firms from the S&P 1500 universe,  \n\nTable 1 Summary statistics of labor market peers   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">PanelA:CoverageofS&P1500firms</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">RepresentationofS&P1500universe</td><td></td><td>S&P1500firmsS&P500firms</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">(1) Number offirmswithaLinkedIncompanyhomepage</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">(2)</td><td>1464</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>Number of firms with“people also viewed\"feature on LinkedIn 1456</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">(3) AtleastoneLinkedInlabormarketpeerwithcommonshares and listed onNYSE,NASDAQorAMEX</td><td>1325</td><td>449</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">(4) NumberoffirmswithaGlassdoorcompanyhomepage</td><td></td><td>442</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">(5) Atleastonelabormarketpeerwithcommonshares</td><td>1309 1250</td><td>425</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B: Composition of S&P 1500 firms’ labor market peers   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Numberof publiclabor market peers</td><td>S&P1500firms LinkedIn</td><td>S&P500firms LinkedIn</td><td>S&P1500firms Glassdoor</td><td>S&P500firms Glassdoor</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>87</td><td>12</td><td>42</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>145</td><td>41</td><td>80</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>258</td><td>50</td><td>89</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>273</td><td>94</td><td>122</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>290</td><td>106</td><td>143</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>272</td><td>146</td><td>174</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>7-12</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>600</td><td>299</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1325</td><td>449</td><td>1250</td><td>425</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table provides summary statistics for S&P 1500 firms’ Linkedln and Glassdoor labor-market peer firms. Panel A reports the coverage of S&P 1500 firms on LinkedIn and Glassdoor. The first row reports the number of base firms with a LinkedIn company homepage. The second row removes firms without a \"People Also Viewed\" browsemap on its LinkedIn company homepage. The third row restricts the sample to firms that could be matched with Compustat and with at least one public labor market peer listed on NYSE, NASDAQ, or AMEX with a CRSP share code of 10 or 11. The third and fourth rows repeat steps in the second and third rows and report the number of firms for the Glassdoor sample. Columns (1) and (2) report the number of firms within the S&P 1500 and S&P 500 samples, respectively. Panel B reports the number of base firms with a corresponding number of public labor market peers. For the LinkedIn sample, each firm has at most six labor market peers, which are a mix of private and public peers. Columns (1) and (2) report the number of base firms with a corresponding number of public Linkedln labor market peers for the S&P 1500 and S&P 500 samples, respectively. For example, in the S&P 1500 firms, 87 base firms have only one public labor market peer, 145 have two, and 258 have three. For the Glassdoor sample, each firm has at most 12 labor market peers. Columns (3) and (4) report the number of base firms with a corresponding number of public Glassdoor labor market peers for the S&P 1500 and S&P 500 samples, respectively  \n\nincluding 449 S&P 500 firms.11 I apply a similar process to collect the “Job Seekers Also Viewed’ firms on Glassdoor for each company in February 2017, which further reduces my sample to 1,250 firms. Table 1 panel B provides the count of public labor market peers. Ninety-three percent $(82\\%)$ of the LinkedIn S&P 1500 sample has at least two (three) public labor market peers. I keep base firms with at least two public peers, but the results are robust to requiring three public peers or to removing this restriction. I obtain stock return data from CRSP, financial information and executive compensation data from Compustat and ExecuComp. TNIC industry data are obtained from the Hoberg and Phillips data library. Firm location data are from Glassdoor. Median employee salary is computed based on Glassdoor salary data or from the Equilar database based on firm proxy statements. Compensation benchmarking peers are obtained from ISS Incentive Lab. Customer-supplier relationships are based on the Compustat Segments Customer File. The number of observations differs across tests, due to data availability.  \n\n## 3.3 Summary statistics  \n\n### 3.3.1 Comparing labor market peers identified from Linkedln and Glassdoor  \n\nThe LinkedIn algorithm is mainly based on “also viewed\" company pages, while the Glassdoor algorithm is primarily based on “also viewed\" job postings. Despite this difference, I expect an overlap in labor market peers identified from LinkedIn and Glassdoor because most activities on the sites are career-related. Indeed $72\\%$ (897/1250) of the base firm's LinkedIn labor market peers share at least one firm with the Glassdoor labor market peers. Among these firms, $49\\%$ of LinkedIn peers are also captured by the Glassdoor peers. This significant overlap validates the LMP measure and suggests that employee “also viewed\" patterns on the two sites reveal a firm's essential labor market peers. Despite this commonality, LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers also differ. I further discuss this difference in Appendix B.  \n\n### 3.3.2 Comparison with product market peers  \n\nTable 2 shows the extent to which a firm's labor market peers differ from its product market peers. The differences are measured by the proportion of labor market peers that belong to different industry classification (two-digit GICS, six-digit GICS, two-digit SIC, four-digit SIC, three-digit NAICS, and six-digit NAICS) compared to the base firm. The results show that labor market peers overlap with but differ from product market peers.  \n\nTable 2 Difference between labor market peers and standard industry classifications

schemes by each GICS2 industry sector. Panels A to B report the fraction of Linkedln and Glassdoor labor market peers with different industry classifications (for GICS2, GICS6, SIC2, SIC4, NAICS3, and NAICS6) from the base firm's, respectively. Panel C reports the fraction for union labor market peers, which is the union of the LinkedIn and Glassdoor. Panel D reports the fraction for intersection labor market peers, which is the intersection of the Linkedln and Glassdoor. In Panels C and D, I require the base firms to have overlapping Linkedln and Glassdoor labor market peers for comparison purposes  \n\nFor LinkedIn labor market peers (Panel A), $18\\%$ have a different two-digit GICS classification from the base firm, $39\\%$ have a different two-digit SIC, and $60\\%$ have a different four-digit SIC. Meanwhile, the Glassdoor peers (Panel B) have a greater difference, with $42\\%$ having a different two-digit GICS, $63\\%$ having a different twodigit SIC, and $77\\%$ having a different four-digit SIC. These variations between the LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers can be attributed to platform-specific differences, such as the maximum number of “also viewed’ firms displayed and other factors discussed by AppendixB.12  \n\nFor the union and intersection peers, I require the base firm to have at least one overlapping LinkedIn and Glassdoor labor market peer for the purpose of comparison. The union peers (Panel C) tend to have differences between those of the LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers, while the intersection peers (Panel D), which are likely the core set of peers, has slightly more overlap with product market peers.  \n\nThe degree of difference between the firm's input and output markets varies by industry, with some industries having less difference, such as energy, healthcare, financial, and information technology, and others having greater difference, such as materials, consumer staples, and industrials. An example is the Dow Chemical, which belongs to the materials industry. Its LinkedIn labor market peers span five different two-digit GICS industries: materials (BASF and Dupont), industrials (3M), energy (Exxon Mobil), healthcare (Monsanto), and consumer staples (Procter & Gamble).  \n\n### 3.3.3 Labor skill similarity  \n\nOne way to measure the relatedness of firms in the labor market is analyzing the proportion of skills that are shared among them. I use self-reported skills listed in the Skills & Expertise section of LinkedIn member profiles. These skills are publicly available to LinkedIn members and are endorsed by their network, which serves as a credibility indicator. LinkedIn also provides an overview of the five most common skills of a company's current employees on each company's LinkedIn homepage. Additionally, LinkedIn uses a proprietary algorithm to calculate related skills for each of the top skills, for example, the top skills and expertise of Google are Google Adwords, Python, machine learning, AdSense, and Google technologies. The related skills for machine learning are feature selection, text mining, pattern recognition, etc.13  \n\nI measure the skill similarity $s_{i,j}$ between firm $i$ and firm $j$ as the proportion of skills that are shared by both, divided by the number of total unique skills of both. This measure is defined as:  \n\n$$\ns_{i,j}=\\frac{|C_{i}\\cap C_{j}|}{|C_{i}\\cup C_{j}|},\n$$  \n\nwhere $C_{i}$ is the skill set of firm $i$ and $C_{j}$ is the skill set of firm $j$ .For example,Google has 88 skills, and Facebook has 76 skills. They have 32 skills in common. Their skill  \n\nTable 3 Summary statistics of skill similarity ratio   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>GICS2groupings</td><td>Number of firms (1)</td><td>LinkedIn labor market peers (2)</td><td>Otherlabormarket related firms (3)</td><td>(2)-(3) (4)</td></tr><tr><td>Energy</td><td>82</td><td>0.19</td><td>0.09</td><td>0.10***</td></tr><tr><td>Utilities</td><td>61</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.06***</td></tr><tr><td>Real Estate</td><td>15</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.09***</td></tr><tr><td>Financial</td><td>172</td><td>0.14</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.04***</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer discretionary</td><td>209</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.06***</td></tr><tr><td>Health care</td><td>147</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.05***</td></tr><tr><td>Materials</td><td>87</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.05***</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer staples</td><td>72</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.04***</td></tr><tr><td>Industrials</td><td>187</td><td>0.08</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.04***</td></tr><tr><td>Communication services</td><td>44</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.02***</td></tr><tr><td>Information technology</td><td>236</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.05</td><td>0.02***</td></tr><tr><td>S&P1500</td><td>1311</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.05***</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table provides summary statistics of the average skill similarity scores between the base firm and its LinkedIn labor market peers by each GICS2 industry sector. Skillsimilarity $s_{i,j}$ is defined in Eq. 1, and is measured as the fraction of skills shared by firm i and firm $j$ divided by the number of total unique skills of firm i and firm $j$ . Column (1) reports the number of firms in each GICS2 sector. Column (2) reports the average skill similarity between the base firm and its labor market peers. Column (3) reports the average skill similarity between the base firm and any firm in my sample that shares at least one skill with the base firm. Column (4) reports the difference between Columns (2) and (3). $^{***}$ denotes significance at the $1\\%$ level (two-tailed t-test)  \n\nsimilrity would be $\\begin{array}{r}{s_{G o o g l e,F a c e b o o k}=\\frac{32}{88+76-32}=0.24.}\\end{array}$ The top and the relaed skills of Google and Facebook can be seen in Appendix D.  \n\nTable 3 summarizes the labor market similarity between the base firm and its LinkedIn labor market peers by measuring the proportion of shared skills. The table presents data on the number of firms and average skill similarity in each two-digit GICS industry. The skill similarity between the base firm and its labor market peers is compared to the average skill similarity between the base firm and other firms that share at least one skill in my sample. The expectation is that, if labor market peers capture firms’ critical labor market peers, the average skill similarity between the base firm and its peers will be higher than the benchmark. On average, S&P 1500 firms share $11\\%$ of skills with their labor market peers, as compared to $6\\%$ with the benchmark groups. Firms share significantly more skills with their labor market peers than with the benchmark in every GICS2 industry. Firms in the information technology industry have the lowest commonality with peers $(7\\%)$ , while energy, utility, and financial firms share $19\\%$ $15\\%$ , and $14\\%$ of skills with their labor market peers respectively.14 Generally, the more skills the base and peer firms share, the more related they are in the labor market. This result supports the conclusion that labor market peers capture labor market relatedness.15  \n\n# 4 Labor market peers and comovements  \n\nThere is a large economics and finance literature on the impact of labor market shocks or risks on employee wages, firm earnings, and stock returns. Studies have found that labor market shocks or risks can affect not only employee wages but also firm earnings and stock returns (Mayers 1973; Jaganathan and Wang 1996; Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou 2013; Donangelo 2014). I develop a stylized model in Appendix A and illustrate how firms’ earnings comove when they hire similar types of scarce labor, and how that comovement strengthens when they share more types of scarce labor. As a result, firms’ stock returns will also comove when they are subject to common labor market shocks or risks.  \n\nIn this section, I control for output market shocks and risks using existing industry groupings and show that labor market peers have significant incremental explanatory power over traditional industry groupings in understanding the cross-sectional variation of returns, valuation multiples, profitability, expense ratios, and wages. This supports the idea that the labor market captures firms’ fundamental connections beyond the output market.  \n\nMoreover, the LMP measure explains more of the cross-sectional variation of returns and wages when firms share more skills and outperforms alternative industry peers when firms share more skills with their peers, supporting the idea that it captures firms’ labor market similarities.  \n\n## 4.1 Return comovements of labor market peers  \n\nAn important aspect of firms’ economic linkages is the degree of contemporaneous correlation in their stock returns. In this analysis, I investigate to what extent labor market peers outperform standard industry classifications in explaining stock return comovements.  \n\nMy first test compares labor market peers with existing industry peers to explain the base firm's stock return variation. Iestimate the cross-sectional regression specification following the method used by Bhojraj et al. (2003) and Lee et al. (2015), for every month from 2014 to 2019. The regression specification is as follows:  \n\n$$\nR_{i,t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta_{t}\\:R_{p e e r,t}+\\epsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $R_{i,t}$ is the monthly stock return for each base firm $i$ drawn from CRSP monthly files and where $R_{p e e r,t}$ is the equally weighted average monthly portfolio return based on the base firm's LMP, GICS, SIC, NAICS, or TNIC peers, excluding the base firm. I estimate Eq. 2 across firms for every month from 2014 to 2019 and obtain an average $R^{2}$ based on the 72 regressions.  \n\nI construct peer portfolio returns using the same number of firms as the number of labor market peers. Since the LMP measure likely picks a firm's closest labor market peers, I select a firm's closest product-market or industry peers for the benchmark peer portfolio construction. Different methods are used to select the closest productmarket or industry peers, such as using the Hoberg-Phillips score data for the TNIC peer construction and selecting peer firms closest in size and in the same industry as the base firm for the GICS, SIC, and NAICS industry peers. For example, to construct the TNIC peer portfolio for a base firm with six labor market peers, I would select six TNIC peers with the highest Hoberg-Phillips score data. To construct the GICS peer portfolio for a base firm with six labor market peers, I would select the six firms closest in size and in the same most granular GICS industry classification as the base firm. If the number of firms in the most granular industry specification is less than the number of labor market peers, I would move up to the next level of industry specification.16  \n\nFour sets of labor market peers are analyzed in this section: the LinkedIn peers, the Glassdoor peers, the union of the LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers, and the intersection of the LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers. For a given base firm, the union set has the most labor market peers, while the intersection set has fewest. The union set likely captures a broader set of labor market peers, and the intersection set likely captures a core set of labor market peers. I don't have an expectation as to which set would perform best but do expect my results to be robust and consistent across the four sets if both the LinkedIn and Glassdoor “also viewed” algorithms capture a similar construct. To facilitate comparison, all regressions are conducted using the same underlying set of base firms. This reduces the number of firms in my sample because only $72\\%$ Oof the base firms' LinkedIn and Glassdoor labor market peers intersect. In online appendix, I drop the intersection sample and show that the results are robust to using a larger sample without requiring overlap between Glassdoor and LinkedIn labor market peers.  \n\nSuppose that the LMP measure captures firms’ connections that transmit common shocks beyond the output market. In that case, it should exhibit incremental power over standard industry classifications in explaining the base firm's stock-return variation. I test the regression specification  \n\n$$\nR_{i,t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta_{L M P,t}~R_{L M P,t}+\\sum\\beta_{p e e r,t}~R_{p e e r,t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $R_{L M P,t}$ is the equally weighted average monthly portfolio return based on the LMP measure and $R_{p e e r,t}$ is the equally weighted average monthly portfolio return based on the same number of closest GICS, SIC, NAICS, or TNIC peers.  \n\nColumns (1) to (5) of Panels A to $\\mathrm{D}$ of Table 4 report estimation results for Eq. 2 for the LinkedIn, Glassdoor, union, and intersection labor market peers, respectively. The average $R^{2}$ is the main measure for explanatory power. The Linkedln labor market peers explain an average of $14.8\\%$ of the cross-sectional variation in realized returns, significantly outperforming output-market-based or investment-oriented industry groupings, that is, GICS $(12.8\\%)$ , SIC $(10.6\\%)$ , NAICS $(10.7\\%)$ , and TNIC $(11.3\\%)$ . The Glassdoor labor market peers explain an average of $11.9\\%$ of the cross-sectional variation in realized returns, significantly underperforming benchmark peers based on GICS but on par with peers based on SIC, NAICS, and TNIC. The union labor market peers explain an average of $14.6\\%$ of the cross-sectional variation  \n\nTable 4 Return comovement tests based on labor market peers and on alternative industry groupings   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Panel A: LinkedIn labor market peers</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td></tr><tr><td>VARIABLES</td><td>ret</td><td>ret</td><td>ret</td><td>ret</td><td>ret</td><td>ret</td><td>ret</td></tr><tr><td>LMP_LN</td><td>0.579***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.323***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(33.344)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(22.350)</td></tr><tr><td>GICS_LN</td><td></td><td>0.461***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.244***</td><td>0.186***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(28.093)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(19.660)</td><td>(15.581)</td></tr><tr><td>SIC_LN</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.388***</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.084***</td><td>0.060***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(24.317)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(6.655)</td><td>(4.947)</td></tr><tr><td>NAICS_LN</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.398***</td><td></td><td>0.104***</td><td>0.068***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(26.445)</td><td></td><td>(8.702)</td><td>(5.695)</td></tr><tr><td>TNIC_LN</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.407***</td><td>0.237***</td><td>0.159***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(27.294)</td><td>(24.029)</td><td>(17.739)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>39,600</td><td>39,600</td><td>39,600</td><td>39,600</td><td>39,600</td><td>39,600</td><td>39,600</td></tr><tr><td>Avg.

The dependent variable is the base firm's stock-level monthly returns. In columns (1) to (5), the independent variable is the equally weighted contemporaneous average return of the LinkedIn labor market peers (LMP_LN), GICS, SIC, NAICS, or TNIC peers formed with the top-N number of industry peers closest in size with the base firm, where $_\\mathrm{N}$ is the number labor market peer firms. Column (6) includes peer returns from all alternative industry groupings. Column (7) adds portfolio returns from the LinkedIn peers. Panels A to D report results for the LinkedIn, Glassdoor, union, and intersection labor market peers, respectively. The time-series average of monthly cross-sectional regression coefficients and average R-squared values are reported. The t-statistics of coefficient estimates are reported in parentheses, where \\*, \\*\\*, and $^{***}$ denote significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ significance levels, respectively. The sample includes S&P 1500 firms, whose LinkedIn and Glassdoor labor market peers overlap and have at least two publicly traded labor market peers between 2014 and 2019  \n\nin realized returns, insignificantly different from the performance of GICS peers and outperforming other peers used in this paper. The intersection labor market peers explain an average of $11.4\\%$ of the cross-sectional variation in realized returns, outperforming peers based on GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC. Two-tailed t-tests are performed to test the difference significance. Note that the performance of the same benchmark industry grouping differs from Panel A to D; this is because I require the same number of firms as the corresponding labor market peer to construct a benchmark industry portfolio, and thus the number of firms used to construct a benchmark portfolio likely differs across panels.  \n\nNext Iexamine whether labor market peers capture firms’ fundamental connections beyond traditional output-market-based peers. Columns (6) to (7) of Panels A to D of Table 4 show the incremental power of labor market peers. In Panel A column (6), GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC together explain an average of $18.5\\%$ of crosssectional variation in realized returns. Adding the LinkedIn labor market peer portfolio in column (7) increases the overall explanatory power to $21.6\\%$ . Similarly, adding the Glassdoor portfolio increases the overall explanatory power from $19.1\\%$ to $20.9\\%$ the union portfolio increases the overall explanatory power from $19.4\\%$ to $21.7\\%$ ， and the intersection portfolio increases the overall explanatory power from $15.3\\%$ to $18.9\\%$ . Two-tailed t-tests, conducted on the time-series of monthly differences from 2014 to 2019, indicate that the explanatory power of column (7) is significantly greater than that of column (6) for all four portfolios at the $1\\%$ significance level. On average, labor market peers achieve an improvement of $14.9\\%$ inaverage $R^{2}$ values over the aggregate explanatory power of GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC for the S&P 1500 sample.17 The results suggest that the labor market peer measure captures frms? important fundamental connections that are not identified by traditional industry peers.  \n\nIn Section 5.2, I show that my results are robust to alternative methods of selecting closest product market peers. This includes selecting peers that are in the same industry and have the closest performance or firms that are closest in both size and performance to the base firm. I also show that my findings are robust when using benchmark portfolios constructed with more peers, such as those based on industry and size quartile-matched portfolios or portfolios that include all firms in the same industry.  \n\n## 4.2 Accounting ratios and valuation multiples  \n\nAnother measure of firms’ economic connections is the degree of contemporaneous correlation in their accounting-based performance metrics. Brown and Ball (1967) show that industry earnings explain a substantial amount of an individual firm's earnings. I use the same sample and methodology as in the stock return analysis, and the LMP measure should have incremental explanatory power over traditional industry peers in explaining profitability ratios and valuation multiples if it measures input market shocks that affect firm value. I use annual data from Compustat on a range of expense ratios, valuation multiples, and a number of other financial ratios, including research and development expenses scaled by net sales (rdpersales); selling, general and administrative expenses scaled by net sales (sgapersales); the price-to-book ratio $(p b)$ ; the enterprise value-to-sales ratio $(e\\nu s)$ ; the price-to-earnings ratio $(p e)$ returns on net operating assets (rnoa); the return on equity (roe); the inverse of assets turnover $(a t)$ ; the profit margin $\\left(p m\\right)$ ; leverage (leverage); and one-year-ahead realized sales growth (salesgrowth). The methods used to calculate these ratios are detailed in Appendix C.  \n\nFor each of these variables, I start by running the cross-sectional regression including traditional industry groupings:  \n\n$$\nR a t i o_{i,t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\sum\\beta_{p e e r,t}R a t i o_{p e e r,t}+\\epsilon_{i,t}\n$$  \n\nand then add the accounting-based performance ratio of my measure:  \n\n$$\nR a t i o_{i,t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta_{L M P,t}R a t i o_{L M P,t}+\\sum\\beta_{p e e r,t}R a t i o_{p e e r,t}+\\epsilon_{i,t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $R a t i o_{i,t}$ is the variable of interest for each base firm $i$ and $R a t i o_{L M P,t}$ is the equally weighted average of the same variable for the closest labor market peers. The independent variables are the same number of equally weighted ratios of the closest GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC peers. I estimate these regressions for every calendar year from 2014 to 2019. I use yearly ratios because different industries are more comparable at the yearly level, due to seasonalities.18  \n\nTable 5 presents the results.

Column (1) shows the number of firms involved in each regression. Column (2) reports the average $R^{2}$ from a yearly cross-sectional regression of the form $R a t i o_{i,t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta_{1,t}R a t i o_{G I C S,t}+$ $\\beta_{2,t}R a t i o_{S I C,t}+\\beta_{3,t}R a t i o_{N A I C S,t}+\\beta_{4,t}R a t i o_{T N I C,t}+\\epsilon_{i,t}.$ The dependent variable is the financial ratio of the base firm, and the independent variables are the average financial ratios of the top-N firms in each industry grouping. $_\\mathrm{N}$ is the number of firms in the corresponding labor market peers. The closest peers were selected based on size and industry similarity (for GICS, SIC, and NAICS) and Hoberg-Phillips score (for TNIC). Each row shows a different financial ratio defined in Appendix C. Panel A column (3) adds the average financial ratio of the LinkedIn labor market peers to the regression form in column (2) and reports average $R^{2}$ values from yearly cross-sectional regressions. Column (4) reports the difference in average $R^{2}$ values between the regressions in columns (3) and (2) and reports significance based on two-tailed t-tests. Panels B to D report results based on the Glassdoor, union, and intersection labor market peers respectively. The sample includes S&P 1500 firms whose LinkedIn and Glassdoor peers overlap, and each have at least two publicly traded firms. I drop observations with missing total assets, long-term debt, net income before extraordinary items, operating income after depreciation, negative common or total equity, share prices smaller than $\\$3$ at the end of the fiscal year, and net sales smaller than $\\$100$ million. Significance levels are indicated by \\*, $^{**}$ and $^{***}$ for $10\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $1\\%$ respectively  \n\nof firms for each estimation. Columns (2) and (3) report the average value of $R^{2}$ on yearly cross-sectional regressions for Eqs. 4 and 5, respectively. Column (4) reports two-tailed t-tests for the $R^{2}$ difference between columns (2) and (3) based on the time-seriesof $R^{2}$ from 2014 to 2019.  \n\nTable 5 shows that labor market peers exhibit significant incremental explanatory power over the aggregate power of GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC in explaining crosssectional variation in accounting-based performance metrics, such as expense ratios and valuation multiples. For example, adding LinkedIn peer portfolio helps explain a significantly greater proportion of the cross-sectional variation for expense ratios (rdpersales, sgapersales), valuation multiples $(p b,e\\nu s)$ , and financial statement ratios (rnoa, at, pm, leverage). The increases for LinkedIn labor market peers are statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level for rdpersales, sgapersales, evs, at, pm, at the $5\\%$ level for rnoa, and at the $10\\%$ level for $p b_{;}$ . leverage. The results for the Glassdoor, union, and intersection peers in Panels B to $\\mathrm{D}$ are also similar, further supporting the robustness of the findings.  \n\nIn sum, the LMP measure increases the explanatory power of existing industrypeer portfolios in explaining cross-sectional accounting-based performance ratios. If GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC peer portfolios together capture common output market shocks, the results in Tables 4 and 5 illustrate that the LMP measure captures important common input-market shocks that are not reflected by existing industry measures.  \n\n## 4.3 Cross-sectional evidence  \n\n### 4.3.1 Return comovements by skill similarity  \n\nIn this section,I provide cross-sectional evidence toexamine whether the LMP measure captures labor market relatedness. If it does capture firms’ labor market similarities, I expect labor market peers to explain more cross-sectional variation in returns when firms share more skills with their peers and are thus exposed to more labor shocks and risks, as illustrated in the stylized model in Appendix A. Additionally, I expect labor market peers to outperform other industry measures when firms are more closely connected with their peers in the labor market.  \n\nSpecifically, I sort the sample into terciles based on the proportion of shared skills between the base firm and its LinkedIn labor market peers. I use skill similarity (defined in Eq. 1), as a proxy for firms’ labor market shocks and risks. Because the skill similarity is based on LinkedIn data, I examine the performance of only LinkedIn labor market peers and the corresponding GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC peers in this section. The bottom tercile shares an average of $2.5\\%$ skills with their LinkedIn peers, the median shares an average of $10.4\\%$ , and the top tercile shares an average of $23.2\\%$  \n\nColumns (1) to (3) of Panel A of Table 6 report the results of estimating Eq. 2 every month from 2014 to 2019, using LinkedIn peer portfolios for each skill similarity group. As firms share more skills with their peers, the average $R^{2}$ increases from $4.7\\%$ for the bottom tercile, to $11.6\\%$ for the median tercile, and then to $22.5\\%$ for the  \n\nTable 6 Return comovements tests by skill similarity   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel A: LinkedIn labor market peers</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td>LMP_LN</td><td>0.31***</td><td>0.49***</td><td>0.73***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(16.30)</td><td>(23.98)</td><td>(33.49)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>17,685</td><td>17,635</td><td>17,652</td></tr><tr><td>Avg.

I sort the sample into terciles based on the proportion of shared labor skills between the base firm and its labor market peers. The dependent variables are the base firm's monthly stock returns. From Panels A to D, the independent variable is the equally weighted contemporaneous average return of LinkedIn labor market peers, closest GICS peers, SIC peers, NAICS peers, and TNIC peers with the same number of LinkedIn labor market peers. Firms in column (1) are in the bottom tercile and share the least proportion of labor skills with their labor market peers. Firms in Column (2) are in the middle tercile. And firms in Column (3) are in the top tercile. The time-series average of monthly cross-sectional regression coefficients and the R-squared values are both reported. The t-statistics of coefficient estimates are reported in parentheses, where \\*, $^{**}$ and $^{***}$ denote significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ ,and $1\\%$ significance levels, respectively. The sample includes the S&P 1500 sample that has at least two publicly traded LinkedIn labor market peer firms between 2014 and 2019  \n\ntop tercile. Two-tailed t-tests indicate that these differences are significant at the $1\\%$ level.  \n\nNext I examine the relative performance of the LMP measure, compared with traditional industry groupings, for each skill similarity group. Product- and labormarket peers may overlap, so they may capture common risks and shocks. But when a firm shares more skills with its peers, it is likely exposed to more labor market shocks and risks, and thus peer measures that capture more common labor market shocks and risks will outperform other industry measures in explaining return variation of the basefirm.  \n\nIn Table 6, for each tercile, I estimate Eq. 2 separately for GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC portfolios formed by the same number of closest industry peers. Panels B to E show the results of the comparison. The average $R^{2}$ values for each tercile are also presented in Fig. 3. When firms share the least amount of labor skills, the explanatory power of the LMP measure is not significantly different from other industry portfolios. However, as firms share more labor skills, the measure significantly outperforms other industry measures. The sharpest contrast comes from comparing the average $R^{2}$ for the high skill-similarity group. The LMP measure explains $22.5\\%$ of the cross-sectional returns, while GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC explain $18.2\\%$ ， $15.9\\%$ ， $16.1\\%$ ， $17.0\\%$ of the cross-sectional returns respectively. The $R^{2}$ differences between the LMP measure and these alternative industry measures are significant at the $1\\%$ level based on twotailed t-tests.19  \n\n![](images/57c5179de6181a6c0506d25c7b51c624842cd917a2aac2032dd7963070b20dd0.jpg)  \nFig. 3 Comparison of return comovement $R^{2}$ values among the LMP measure and alternative industry groupings by skill similarity.This figure reports the average R? values from monthly cross-sectional regressions of the form $R_{i,t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta_{t}R_{I n d,t}+\\epsilon_{i,t}$ for different industry-peer and skill-similarity groups from 2014 to 2019. The dependent variables are the base firm's monthly stock returns. The independent variable is the equally weighted contemporaneous average return of LinkedIn labor market peer, closest GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC peer firms. I sort the sample into terciles based on the average skill similarity between the base firm and its labor market peers. Skill similarity $s_{i,j}$ is defined in Eq. 1 and is measured as the number of skills shared by firm $i$ and firm $j$ divided by the number of total skills of firm i and firm $j$ .High skill similarity implies more shared labor skills between the base firm and its peers. The horizontal line is the skill-similarity group, and the vertical line is the average $R^{2}$ values. The sample includes S&P 1500 firms with at least two publicly traded LinkedIn labor market peer firms  \n\n### 4.3.2 Salary comovements by skill similarity  \n\nOne direct test of firms’ labor market similarities is the similarities of employee salaries. Firms that share similar labor markets should provide comparable salaries. If the LMP measure captures firms? labor market peers, I expect it to explain more of the base firm's salary when that firm and its labor market peers share more skills. I also expect the measure to outperform other industry measures at explaining employee salaries when the base firm and its labor market peers share more skills. I use median employee salary as a proxy for firm salary. For the year 2014 to 2016, I use Glassdoor salary review data to construct annual median employee salary at the firm level. Since 2017, SEC has required firms to disclose the ratio of the compensation of its chief executive officer (CEO) to the median compensation of its employees. For the years 2017 to 2019, I obtain the pay ratio and CEO compensation data from the Equilar database to compute the median employee salary.20  \n\nColumns (1) to (3) of Panel A of Table 7 report the results of regressing annual employee median salary on the average median salary of LinkedIn labor market peers every year from 2014 to 2019 for each skill similarity group. The decrease in the number of observations was significant because these tests require all firms to have available median employee salary data. From columns (1) to (3), the average $R^{2}$ increases from $22.3\\%$ to $40.9\\%$ and then to $57.9\\%$ as firms start sharing more labor skills with their peers. Two-tailed t-tests show that the differences are significant at the $1\\%$ level.  \n\nNext I compare the performance of the LMP measure with traditional industry groupings for each skill similarity group. Similar to the return comovement tests by skill similarity group, when a firm shares more labor market skills with its peers, I expect peer measures that capture more common labor market shocks and risks to outperform other industry measures at explaining salary variation of the base firm.  \n\nIn Table 7, for each tercile, I estimate the explanatory power separately for GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC portfolios formed by closest peers as the same number of LinkedIn peers. Panels B to $\\mathrm{D}$ show the results for comparison. Figure 4 presents the average $R^{2}$ values for each regression and tercile. When firms share the fewest skills, the explanatory power of the LMP measure is not significantly different from other industry portfolios. It significantly outperforms other industry measures for the median skill-similarity group. For the high skill-similarity group, it explains $57.9\\%$ of the cross-sectional returns, compared to $44.7\\%$ $40.8\\%$ ， $45.3\\%$ ， $47.8\\%$ for GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC portfolios respectively. The $R^{2}$ differences are significant at  \n\nTable 7 Salary comovements test based on the LMP measure by skill similarity   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel A: LinkedIn labor market peers</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td>Salary_LMP_LN</td><td>0.54***</td><td>0.75***</td><td>0.89***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(10.29)</td><td>(35.06)</td><td>(39.46)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1,232</td><td>1,296</td><td>1,293</td></tr><tr><td>Avg.

I sort the sample into terciles based on the proportion of shared labor skills between the base firm and its Linkedln labor market peers. The dependent variables are the base firm's annual median employee salary. From Panels A to D, the independent variable is the equally weighted contemporaneous average salary of LinkedIn labor market peers, GICS peers, SIC peers, NAICS peers, and TNIC peers closet in size, and with the same number of firms as LinkedIn labor market peers. Firms in column (1) are in the bottom tercile and share the fewest skills with their labor market peers. Firms in column (2) are in the middle tercile. And firms in Column (3) are in the top tercile. The time-series average of annual cross-sectional regression coefficients and the R-squared values are both reported. The t-statistics of coeffcient estimates are reported in parentheses, where \\*, \\*\\* and \\*\\*\\* denote significance at the $10\\%$ $5\\%$ ,and $1\\%$ significance levels, respectively. The sample includes the S&P 1500 sample that has at least two publicly traded LinkedIn labor market peer firms between 2014 and 2019  \n\nthe $1\\%$ level between the LMP measure and GICS, SIC, NAICS peers and at the $5\\%$ level for the TNIC peers.  \n\nOverall the results show that the LMP measure explains a higher proportion of return and salary comovements when firms are closely connected in the labor market. The measure outperforms traditional measures when firms share more labor skills. These findings allay concerns that labor market peers capture closely related peers that have no connection in the labor market (e.g., an alternative explanation is that labor market peers refect general interest among LinkedIn and Glassdoor users but have no relationship to a firm's labor market). Under this alternative explanation, it is unlikely to see a systematic relationship between skill similarity and the performance of the LMP measure.  \n\n# 5 Additional analyses and robustness tests  \n\n## 5.1 Investigating measurement error and selection bias  \n\n### 5.1.1 Measurement error from customer and supplier relationships  \n\nAs discussed in Section 3.1.3, some users use LinkedIn for lead generation, and thus labor market peers may reflect firms? customer and supplier relationships. It is unlikely that Glassdoor labor market peers are formed through lead generation because Glassdoor reviews are anonymous and users cannot contact each other. However, for the completeness of the analysis, I will examine the four sets of labor market peers as outlined in previous sections.  \n\n![](images/c41b88c663502242bb025a974f0767871f68f73151c0b28134ae1baa56b73021.jpg)  \nFig. 4 Comparison of salary comovement $R^{2}$ values among the LMP measure and alternative industry groupings by skill similarity. This figure reports the average $R^{\\tilde{2}}$ values from monthly cross-sectional regressions of the form $S a l a r y_{i,t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta_{t}S a l a r y_{I n d,t}+\\epsilon_{i,t}$ for different industry-peer and skill-similarity groups from 2014 to 2019. The dependent variables are the base firm's annual median employee salary. The independent variable is the equally weighted contemporaneous average salary of Linkedln labor market peer, closest GICS, SIC, NAICS, and TNIC peer firms. I sort the sample into terciles based on the average skill similarity between the base firm and its labor market peers. Skill similarity $s_{i,j}$ is defined in Eq. 1, and is measured as the number of skills shared by firm $i$ and firm $j$ divided by the number of total skills of firm i and firm $j$ . High skill similarity implies more shared labor skills between the base firm and its peers. The horizontal line is the skill-similarity group, and the vertical line is the average $R^{2}$ values. The sample includes S&P 1500 firms with at least two publicly traded LinkedIn labor market peer firms  \n\nAccording to SFAS No.131, firms must disclose the existence of and sales to customers representing more than $10\\%$ of total firm revenues (principal customers). Therefore I classify two firms as having a customer-supplier relationship if one firm is listed as the other firm's principal customer. Information on customer-supplier relationships is based on the Compustat Segments Customer File (Cen et al. 2018). 1 exclude these customer or supplier firms from the labor market peer sample and replicate columns (6) and (7) of Table 4. The significance level of two-tailed t-test of the $R^{2}$ difference is also reported. Results are presented in Table 8 Panel A and are qualitatively unchanged.  \n\n### 5.1.2 Measurement error from geographic proximity  \n\nLabor market peers may be local firms because geographic distance is a natural component in career considerations (Marinescu and Rathelot 2018) and firms tend to cluster to attract talent (Pouder and St. John 1996). I do not consider these firms as measurement error, but using LinkedIn as a communication channel with local friends and viewing their employer with zero career-related interest may cause measurement error. Although it is difficult to tease out this type of noise from local firms, I form a portfolio of geographically close firms $(R_{g e o p e e r,t})$ for each base firm to control for local firms and local shocks these firms represent. I then examine the incremental return explanatory power of labor market peers over local peers and traditional industry peers. Specifically, I use location data from Glassdoor to identify the metropolitan statistical areas from which employees submit reviews (Dehaan et al. 2023). A firm is considered a local peer if it shares at least one metropolitan statistical area as a work location with the base firm between 2014 to 2019. Results are presented in Table 8 Panel B and show that labor market peers still have significant incremental explanatory power after controlling for local peer returns.  \n\n### 5.1.3 Selection bias based on firm size  \n\nAs discussed in Section 3.1.4, the amount of web traffic and informativeness of LinkedIn or Glassdoor web content may affect the composition of labor market peers. These features likely relate to firm size, and I divide the sample into two groups by base firm size to address this issue. Big firms may attract more users on LinkedIn and Glassdoor, providing a stronger signal to construct labor market peers. However, small firms can still attract users because there may be less alternative information available from other sources, making it unclear which type of firms better captures labor market peers. Panels C and D of Table 8 replicate columns (6) and (7) of Table 4 for small and large firms respectively. The result suggests that labor market peers capture labor market relatedness, regardless of a firm's size. That said, the effect of website content and usage on the LMP measure is an endogeneity threat that I cannot eliminate.  \n\nTable 8 Robustness tests: comparison of $R^{2}$ values   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Panel A: Excluding customer and supplier firms</td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td>Glassdoor</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Standard industriesStandard industries+LMPStandard industriesStandardindustries+LMP</td></tr><tr><td>0.187 0.218***</td><td>0.193 0.210***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Intersection</td></tr><tr><td>Standard industries Standard industries + LMP Standard industries Standard industries +LMP</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.196 0.218***</td><td>0.154 0.190***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">PanelB:Control for local peerfirms</td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td>Glassdoor</td></tr><tr><td>Standard industries Standard industries + LMP Standard industries Standard industries +LMP</td><td>0.195***</td></tr><tr><td>0.171 0.202*** Union</td><td>0.177</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Intersection</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Standard industries Standard industries+LMPStandard industriesStandardindustries+LMP</td></tr><tr><td>0.179 0.202***</td><td>0.146 0.180***</td></tr><tr><td>Panel C:Smallfirms</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td>Glassdoor</td></tr><tr><td>Standard industries Standard industries +LMPStandard industries Standard industries+LMP</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.191***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.164</td><td>0.172 0.190***</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel H: Granular industry classification   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Table8continued</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Union Intersection</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Standard industriesStandard industries +LMPStandard industriesStandard industries+LMH</td></tr><tr><td>0.177</td><td>0.198***</td><td>0.133</td><td>0.164***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel D: Large firms</td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td></td><td>Glassdoor</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Standard industries Standard industries +LMPStandard industriesStandard industries +LMP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.246</td><td>0.289***</td><td>0.248</td><td>0.274***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Union</td></tr><tr><td>0.246</td><td>0.278***</td><td>0.223</td><td>StandardindustriesStandardindustries+LMPStandardindustriesStandardindustries+LMP 0.270***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel E: Closest industry peersmatched by performance and size</td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td></td><td>Glassdoor</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Standard industries Standard industries +LMPStandard industriesStandard industries +LMP</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.217***</td></tr><tr><td>0.188 0.221***</td><td></td><td>0.197</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Union</td><td></td><td>Intersection</td><td>StandardindustriesStandardindustries+LMPStandardindustriesStandardindustries+LMP</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">0.202 0.226***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0.152</td><td>0.192***</td></tr><tr><td>Panel F:Closest industry peers matched by performance</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">LinkedIn Glassdoor</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Standard industriesStandard industries +LMP Standard industries Standard industries +LMP</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.172</td><td>0.205***</td><td>0.173</td><td>0.194***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Union</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>StandardindustriesStandard industries +LMPStandard industriesStandard industries+LMP</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0.174</td><td>0.202***</td><td>0.165</td><td>0.192***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel G: Size quartile matched industry groups</td></tr><tr><td>Standardindustries</td><td>(1)+LMP_LN</td><td>(1)+LMP_GD</td><td>(1)+LMP_UNI</td><td>(1)+LMP_INT</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td>0.199</td><td>0.226***</td><td>0.214***</td><td>0.221***</td><td>0.220***</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Standardindustries</td><td>(1)+LMP_LN</td><td>(1)+LMP_GD</td><td>(1)+LMP_UNI</td><td>(1)+LMP_INT</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td>0.174</td><td>0.211***</td><td>0.197***</td><td>0.207***</td><td>0.200***</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>(7) +LMP_INT 0.331*** 0.192*** 0.188*** Base 0.268 0.162 0.152 E (5) + LMP_UNI 0.316*** 0.187*** 0.213*** Base 0.273 0.154 0.190 (3) +LMP_GD 0.326*** 0.177*** 0.212***</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### 5.1.4 Selection bias by industry  \n\nLastly, some industries are better represented on LinkedIn and Glassdoor than others, and employees in some industries may use these platforms more frequently, leading to selection bias. Although I cannot eliminate this selection bias, I examine whether the results are industry-specific. I classify each base firm in the S&P 1500 sample by its two-digit GICS code and rerun the same specification in Table 4 columns (6) to (7) for each two-digit GICS industry sector (excluding real estate, due to lack of observations). Table 8 Panel I reports the results. Labor market peers significantly increase the explanatory power of stock returns for all two-digit GICS industries, with an increase in R? ranging from $2.2\\%$ for industrial firms to $7.4\\%$ forcommunication servicesfirms.  \n\n## 5.2 Alternative ways of forming benchmarking industry peers  \n\nThis section examines the robustness of the main results in Table 4 Panels A to D columns (6) to (7) to alternative ways of forming industry peers as benchmarks for LinkedIn, Glassdoor, union, and intersection labor market peers.  \n\n### 5.2.1 Top-N peer firms with the closest size and/or performance  \n\nIn this section, the robustness of the main results is tested by using two alternative methods to select a base firm's top-N closest industry (GICS, SIC, or NAICS) peers to form benchmark industry peers. The first alternative approach is to select top$\\mathbf{N}$ firms that are closest in performance and in the same industry as the base firm (Kothari et al. 2005). I use beginning-of-year ROA as a proxy for performance. The second alternative approach is to classify top-N peers as firms that are closest in size and performance. Specifically, I choose firms that are in the same industry and size quartile and closest in performance as the base firm. I select the top-N TNIC peers with the highest Hoberg-Phillips score data, as in Section 4.1. Both of these alternative methods are used to replicate Table 4 columns (6) to (7) for the corresponding industry peers, and the results are presented in Table 8 Panels E and F. The $R^{2}$ valuesincrease for all estimations, and the significance of the $R^{2}$ differences remains at the $1\\%$ level.  \n\n### 5.2.2 Comparison against industry-size peers  \n\nIn this section, I relax the restriction on the number of firms to form an alternative industry peers. This is done to address concerns that averaging a smaller number of peers may bias the results in favor of or against alternative industry groupings. While averaging a smaller number of firms may perform better if the peers are more relevant, this approach may perform worse at cancelling out the idiosyncratic component in stock returns. This section aims to explore this issue further.  \n\nI first apply the approach based on the findings of Albuquerque (2009), who show that industry-size-matched peer groups perform better at capturing peers affected by similar shocks than industry-matched peer groups. To implement this approach, firms are sorted into size quartiles within a two-digit SIC industry and matched with firms in the same industry-size peer group (excluding the firm itself) to compute an equally weighted portfolio return. This method is used to generate size-adjusted industry peers for six-digit GICS industry, two-digit SIC industry, and three-digit NAICS. I then rerun Table 4 columns (6) to (7) for the corresponding size-adjusted industry peers. Table 8 panel G presents the results. The $R^{2}$ differences remain significant and large.  \n\n### 5.2.3 Comparison against benchmark industry peers formed by all industry firms  \n\nIn this section, the incremental performance of labor market peers is compared to benchmark peers formed by all firms within an industry at the industry's most granular level. To do this, the base firm is matched with its eight-digit GICS, four-digit SIC, and six-digit NAICS industry peers and an equally weighted portfolio return is computed. I rerun Table 4 columns (6) to (7) for corresponding peers. The results are presented in Table 8 Panel H, and the $R^{2}$ differences remain significant and are of similar magnitude to the main results.  \n\n## 5.3 The effects of online labor markets on labor market connections  \n\nIn this section, I explore an alternative explanation that the “also viewed\" feature on LinkedIn and Glassdoor enables job seekers to discover companies previously unknown to them, leading to new labor market connections and return comovements, rather than simply reflecting a company's existing connections in the labor market.  \n\nTo test this alternative explanation, I examine the performance of labor market peers prior to the introduction of “also viewed’ functions on online labor market platforms. As both Glassdoor and LinkedIn were founded in 2007, “also viewed\" functions likely became available online between 2007 and 2013. I analyze labor market peer performance during sample periods between 2004 to 2006, 2007 to 2009, 2010 to 2012, and 2013 to 2015, when the infuence of the online labor market on the real labor market was likely limited. Under this alternative explanation, labor market peers should not comove before the introduction of “also viewed\" firms feature on LinkedIn andGlassdoor.  \n\nThe results, shown in Table 9, indicate that labor market peers still demonstrate significant added value over traditional industry classifications in explaining stock returns, suggesting that the introduction of “also viewed”' algorithms is not an impetus for the labor market peer performance. However, this does not rule out the possibility that the “also viewed feature could strengthen labor market connections and enhance comovements. The impact of the “also viewed\" function on the real labor market remains an open area of investigation for further research.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>0.287*** (20.060) 0.138*** (10.066) 0.053*** 0.080*** 0.150*** (12.599) (3.795) (4.715) 31,596 0.168 ret 6 2013-2015 0.180*** (12.634) 0.078*** 0.106*** 0.214*** (13.696) (5.839) (6.929) 31,596 0.142 E 6 0.294*** (17.052) 0.136*** (12.419) 0.059*** 0.054*** 0.158*** (15.719) (4.966) (4.978) 33,329 0.146 ret 6 2010-2012 0.183*** (15.717) 0.076*** 0.084*** 0.228*** (6.458) (7.873) (20.594) 33,329 0.117 ret 6 0.267*** (23.200) 0.138*** (12.872) 0.083*** 0.038*** 0.161*** (15.046) (8.263) (3.589) 32,285 0.152 ret 6 2007-2009 0.180*** (16.261) 0.100*** 0.062*** 0.227*** (9.382) (17.942) (5.640) 32,285 0.128 ? ret 6 0.264*** (17.164) 0.157*** (12.615) 0.090*** 0.175*** (13.802) 0.030** (2.560) (7.983) 29,194 0.155 2 ret 6 Panel B: Glassdoor labor market peers 2004-2006 0.203*** (16.379) 0.049*** 0.113*** 0.238*** (18.519) (4.046) (9.111) 29,194 0.133 (1) ret 3 Number of groups Avg.

First, I find that labor market peers are more likely to be selected as compensation benchmarking peers and help explain CEO compensation. Second, I show that the results are robust to the use of a larger sample without requiring overlap between Glassdoor and LinkedIn labor market peers. Third, I find the results are robust to the use of a pooled regression design.  \n\n# 6 Conclusion  \n\nThis study offers a new measure of labor market peers (LMP) by analyzing the “also viewed' companies on online labor market platforms such as Glassdoor and LinkedIn. The results suggest that labor market peers reveal important economic relationships that are not captured by traditional industry classifications and can provide valuable insights, particularly when firms are closely connected in the labor market.  \n\nI see this study as an initial step in the growing field of using online labor market data for economic and financial analysis. Future research can test the labor market peer construct using different methods, explore differences between online labor market platforms, and investigate how website content and usage impact the composition of labor market peers. Additionally, future research can examine the impact of financial events on labor market peers and the real effects of online labor market platforms on labor market and financial outcomes. Overall there is ample opportunity for further research on firms’ financial performance and their labor market connections through the lens of online labor market platforms.  \n\n# Appendix A: A stylized model of labor market peers and earning comovements  \n\nIn this section, I propose a stylized model in which firms that hire common types of labor in limited supply are exposed to similar labor market shocks, which can affect wages and ultimately firm profits. The model also suggests that the strength of earnings comovements will increase as firms share more types of labor.  \n\nThe stylized model represents two firms, 1 and 2. They share the same types of specific labor in the production process. Specific labor is in limited supply in the short run. To keep the focus on the dynamics of labor, capital is assumed away.21 Outputs  \n\nof firm 1 and 2 are given by:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{Y_{1}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{s\\in S_{1}}{\\beta_{1s}L_{1s}^{\\alpha_{s}}},}\\ {Y_{2}=\\displaystyle\\sum_{s\\in S_{2}}{\\beta_{2s}L_{2s}^{\\alpha_{s}}},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are the labor skills used by firm 1 and 2, respectively; $L_{1s}$ and $L_{2s}$ denote the mass of employed labor with skill $s$ ， $0<\\alpha_{s}<1$ so that firms’ production functions are decreasing returns to scale; and $\\beta_{1s}$ and $\\beta_{2s}$ are parameters denoting production technologies.  \n\nThe firm's profit is $\\pi_{i}=p_{i}Y_{i}-\\sum_{s\\in S_{i}}w_{s}L_{i s}$ ,where $i=1,2$ .Each firm chooses labor to maximize profit. Perfect competition in the labor market drives firms to equate the marginal profitability of employed skills to wages. Hence firms’ profits are:  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{1}^{*}=\\sum_{s\\in S_{1}}(\\alpha_{s}p_{1}\\beta_{1s})^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha_{s}}}((\\alpha_{s}p_{1})^{-1}-1)w_{s}^{\\frac{\\alpha_{s}}{\\alpha_{s}-1}},\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{2}^{*}=\\sum_{s\\in S_{2}}(\\alpha_{s}p_{2}\\beta_{2s})^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha_{s}}}((\\alpha_{s}p_{2})^{-1}-1)w_{s}^{\\frac{\\alpha_{s}}{\\alpha_{s}-1}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are product prices for firm 1 and 2, $w_{s}$ is the wage for labor skill $s$ andeman forlaborsi $s$ $\\begin{array}{r}{L_{1s}=(\\frac{w_{s}}{\\alpha_{s}p_{1}\\beta_{1s}})^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{s-1}}}}\\end{array}$ $\\begin{array}{r}{L_{2s}=(\\frac{w_{s}}{\\alpha_{s}p_{2}\\beta_{2s}})^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{s-1}}}.\\ I}\\end{array}$ assume that there are barriers to entering the product market in the short run, and thus firms have nonzero profits.  \n\nThe supply of labor with skill $s$ is assumed to be $L^{S}=w_{s}^{b_{s}}$ , where the supply increases with wages and with labor supply elasticity $(b_{s}>0)$ 0. The supply of workers with skill $s$ is more elastic when $b_{s}$ is higher, suggesting that a small increase in wages leads to a large increase in labor supply. It takes time for workers to acquire new skills, and so I assume that labor supply is inelastic and that labor markets for different skills are segmented in the short run.  \n\nLabor markets are in equilibrium when the demand for skill $s$ equals its supply, and $L_{1s}+L_{2s}=L^{S}\\epsilon_{s}$ , where $\\epsilon_{s}$ is a demand or a supply $i.i.d$ . shock to the labor market. When the labor market clears ( $\\boldsymbol{L}^{S}=\\boldsymbol{L}^{D}$ ), wages per unit of skill $s$ are endogenously determined in equilibrium:  \n\n$$\nw_{s}=[\\alpha_{s}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{s-1}}}((p_{1}\\beta_{1s})^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha_{s}}}+(p_{2}\\beta_{2s})^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha_{s}}})^{-1}\\epsilon_{s}]^{\\frac{\\alpha_{s}-1}{1+(1-\\alpha_{s})b_{s}}}.\n$$  \n\n## Proposition 1: Firms’ earnings comove when they hire similar types of scarce labor.  \n\nProof: The profits (earnings) of firm 1 and 2 comove due to shocks to shared labor markets. The comovement is represented by the covariance of firms 1's and 2's  \n\nearnings:  \n\n$$\nc o v(\\pi_{1}^{*},\\pi_{2}^{*})=\\sum_{s\\in S_{1}\\cap S_{2}}\\lambda_{s}v a r(w_{s}^{\\frac{\\alpha_{s}}{\\alpha_{s}-1}})=\\sum_{s\\in S_{1}\\cap S_{2}}\\lambda_{s}v a r[(\\gamma_{s}\\epsilon_{s})^{\\frac{\\alpha_{s}}{1+(1-\\alpha_{s})b_{s}}}],\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{l l l}{{\\lambda_{s}}}&{{=}}&{{(\\alpha_{s}^{2}p_{1}p_{2}\\beta_{1s}\\beta_{2s})^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha_{s}}}((\\alpha_{s}p_{1})^{-1}-1)((\\alpha_{s}p_{2})^{-1}-1)}}\\end{array}$ and $\\gamma_{s}=$ s- (pβB1s)-s + (pβ2s)as)-1, which ae both positive parameters, and where $S_{1}\\cap S_{2}$ is the labor skills that firm 1 and 2 share. Thus the covariance of earnings for firms 1 and 2 is the summation of the wage variances in shared labor markets. The more skills the two firms share, the stronger the covariance, and thus we have the following proposition.  \n\nProposition 2: Earning comovements strengthen when firms share more labor skills.  \n\n# Appendix B: Linkedln and Glassdoor comparison  \n\nI compare the LinkedIn with the Glassdoor sample in this appendix. The table below shows the average firm characteristics of the LinkedIn and Glassdoor sample. Glassdoor peers tend to be larger and have more employees. LinkedIn peers tend to have a higher median employee salary of $\\$67$ ,395,compared to $\\$65$ , 365 of the Glassdoor peers (see Section 4.3.2 for the computation of median employee salary). To analyze the geographic relation between the base firm and its labor market peers, I use the location data from Glassdoor to track metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) from which employee reviews are submitted. For each firm, I keep MSAs with more than 10 reviews and assume these MSAs to be the firms' work locations. On average, the base firm shares more MSAs with Glassdoor labor market peers (2.71) than with LinkedIn labor market peers (2.00), indicating that Glassdoor better captures the geographic proximity between firms.  \n\nA few factors might explain the differences in the composition of LinkedIn and Glassdoor labor market peers. First, the also-viewed firms on LinkedIn may reflect more of an employee network because an important engagement for LinkedIn members is through the employee network. Research shows that people with more connections are more likely to be associated with higher paid jobs (Chetty et al. 2022), and referral networks help match high-ability workers to high-paying firms (Burks et al. 2015; Schmutte 2015; Dustmann et al. 2016). So the labor market peers identified through LinkedIn may better reflect the labor market for higher-paid workers.  \n\nSecond, Glassdoor is more likely to capture geographic distance between firms. First, the Glassdoor algorithm for my sample period is based on also-viewed jobs, while the LinkedIn algorithm is likely based on also-viewed companies. Users may be more likely to view job postings from firms located close to them Marinescu and Rathelot (2018). Additionally, the difference in global presence between LinkedIn and Glassdoor could also influence the labor market peers’ differences, as LinkedIn's larger global presence may lead to more diverse labor market peers.22  \n\nThird, firms likely post more jobs on Glassdoor than on LinkedIn, so larger firms may be more likely to be selected as the “job seekers also viewed' firms on Glassdoor. For example, Southwest only has 13 job postings, most of which are data analysts, on LinkedIn. In contrast, there are 86 Southwest jobs posted on Glassdoor on the same day (August 22, 2022), including jobs such as assistant admin, customer service agent, etc. Thus Glassdoor peers are more likely to capture large firms, as Glassdoor labor market peers are based on the browsing histories of a greater variety of employees. However, I hesitate to draw strong inferences for the LinkedIn and Glassdoor labor market peer differences, and further investigation is needed to fully understand the reasons for these differences and their implications.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td>LinkedIn sample</td><td>Glassdoorsample</td><td>Difference</td></tr><tr><td>PercentageofSharedlabormarketpeers</td><td>49%</td><td>35%</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>MedianEmployeeSalary</td><td>67,395</td><td>65,365</td><td>2.030***</td></tr><tr><td>MedianNum.ofSharedMSAs</td><td>2.00</td><td>2.71</td><td>-0.70***</td></tr><tr><td>NumEmployee</td><td>66.16</td><td>122.37</td><td>-56.21***</td></tr><tr><td>Assets</td><td>115,320</td><td>184,851</td><td>-69.531***</td></tr><tr><td>MarketValue</td><td>59,165</td><td>84,910</td><td>-25,745***</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table compares the average of key firm characteristics for the LinkedIn and Glassdoor sample that share at least one labor market peer.

I apply my framework to 20 years of German manufacturing sector micro data containing firm-specific price information to study these three distinct drivers of declining labor shares.

All rights reserved.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nRESEARCH HAS DocUMENTED a worldwide decline in labor's share in economic output (Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2013; Dao et al., 2017). This not only has severe distributional consequences, but also raises doubts on widely applied CobbDouglas production models relying on constant output elasticities of input factors. Not least, the decline in labor shares poses questions about the meaning of work and the future role of people in the economic activities of our society. Therefore, it is unsurprising that a substantial body of literature debates the causes behind the global decline of wage shares.  \n\nTraditionally, research explains falling labor shares through changes in firms' mode of production that reduce the importance of labor to firms. These changes are often seen as a result of biased technological change (Acemoglu, 2003; Oberfield and Raval, 2021), declining relative capital prices (Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2013), or globalization, which facilitates the offshoring of domestic production activities (Harrison, 2005; Elsby et al., 2013). Other work highlights the erosion of labor market institutions (Blanchard and Giavazzi, 2003) and discusses the role of measurement error in explaining declining labor shares (Koh et al., 2020). Most recently, the literature discusses whether rising product markups and firm concentration contributed to falling labor shares (De Loecker and Eeckhout, 2020; De Loecker et al., 2020, henceforth DLEU, Autor et al., 2020).  \n\nYet, despite substantial work, the quantitative importance of the individual channels causing falling labor shares remains not well understood. This study provides such a quantification using a micro-econometric production side framework nesting most of the currently debated mechanisms behind declining labor shares into a parsimonious framework. My framework offers three competing explanations for a fall of labor's share: i) a fall in firms' labor output elasticities, capturing changes in firms' mode of production associated with a decreasing importance of labor to firms, ii) an increase in firms' product market power, or i) an increase in firms' labor market power. The latter two explanations refer to an increase in market distortions and reflect inefficient scenarios.1 In contrast, a decrease in labor's output elasticity causes a fall in the wage share even within a competitive environment. In this case, a fall in labor's share results from an aggregate output maximizing reallocation of factor shares.  \n\nTo study these three distinct drivers of changes in labor's share, I use 20 years of micro-data on German manufacturing sectors firms starting in 1995. This dataset contains information on firms' product quantities and prices, making the data perfectly suited for my study as it allows me to measure firm-specific price variation, which is crucial for calculating unbiased measures of market power parameters and output elasticities (De Loecker et al., 2016, henceforth DLGKP)). In most studies, such information is not accessible.2  \n\nFrom applying my framework, I provide two novel insights. First, by decomposing firm market power into product and labor market power, I show that, coinciding with the fall of labor's share, there is a high and rising degree of aggregate firm labor market power, whereas aggregate product market power, although moderately increasing, stays low. This constitutes important evidence for the debate on rising firm market power and its role for falling labor shares put forward by De Loecker and Eeckhout (2020) and DLEU, who document a severe increase in firm market power throughout the world (particularly in the US) that coincides with the fall of labor shares.3 Most of this debate abstracts from labor market imperfections.4 As consequence, variation in labor's share that does not result from a changing technological importance of labor is by design attributed to product market power. My findings of slightly increasing product market power and strongly rising labor market power challenge this conclusion and point to a key role for labor market power in explaining the documented fall of labor's share.  \n\nFurthermore, by assuming competitive labor markets, the existing literature cannot determine whether rising firm market power results from product or labor markets. Clarifying this, as I do, is important because policies targeting output market power differ from policies targeting labor market power. And indeed, my estimates show that labor market power is the more important source of (growing) firm market power in the German manufacturing sector. Whereas I cannot infer on the much-discussed rise of market power in the US, my findings demonstrate that incorporating labor market power into the analysis is crucial for understanding rising firm market power and its macroeconomic implications.  \n\nSecond, I use my framework to quantify the contribution of market power and changing production processes to the declining wage share. This assessment is informative on the quantitative importance of market power and changing modes of production in explaining a fall of labor's share.5 I answer this question using a simple thought experiment: If a declining labor share results from efficient changes in firms' production processes, the aggregate labor output elasticity decreases in concordance with labor's share. If the labor share, however, falls due to an increase in firms' product or labor market power, one observes a wedge between the wage share and the aggregate labor output elasticity. Applying this idea, I find that half of the decline in Germany's manufacturing sector labor share between 1995 and 2014 is explained by a decrease in the output elasticity of labor. The other half is accounted for by increasing firm market power. Given my estimates of product and labor market power, I infer that most of the contribution of market power results from growing labor market power. Notably, the falling aggregate labor output elasticity results from declining labor output elasticities within most industries and not from reallocation proceses between industries. This supports studies causing doubts on production models featuring time-constant output elasticities of production factors, as most applied Cobb-Douglas specifications (Chirinko et al., 2011; Raval, 2019).  \n\nIn addition to the mentioned literature, my study relates to a substantial body of work on changes in labor's share dating back at least to Kaldor (1955-56, 1957), who established the stability of the labor share as one of his famous stylized facts for economic growth. Already in 1958 (Solow, 1958), published a “skeptical note\" on the presumed constancy of factor shares. In earlier work, Keynes (1939) called the factor share stability “a bit of a miracle\".6 Whereas much of the work in this field focuses on macroeconomic frameworks, my article belongs to a young literature using micro-data to analyze movements of labor's share (e.g. DLEU; Autor et al., 2020; Kehrig and Vincent, 2021; Oberfield and Raval, 2021). The main advantage of using micro-data is that it allows to study the distribution of variables across firms. This is important for understanding the causes of changes in labor's share, labor's output elasticity, and aggregate product and labor market power, which, as I highlight, is central for deriving policy implications.  \n\nFinally, my work relates to a fast-growing literature emphasizing labor market power as an alternative source of firm market power and which recently raised concerns that labor market power creates substantial welfare losses that are comparable to those from product market power (e.g. Naidu et al., 2018; Berger et al., 2019; Azar et al, 2020).7 My article contributes to this research strand by providing insights on how reallocation processes between firms contributed to a severe increase in aggregate labor market power over the past decades in Germany. Furthermore, by linking a direct and firm-specific measure of labor market power to movements of labor's share, my study offers novel insights on the macroeconomic relevance of (growing) firm labor market power.8  \n\nThe remainder proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 derives my framework from which I infer on the mechanisms behind declining labor shares. Section 4 presents descriptive evidence, conducts decomposition exercises, and calculates the contribution of rising market power and changing modes of production to the fall of the labor share. Section 5 provides additional discussion and robustness tests. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Data  \n\nI use an administrative yearly panel dataset on German manufacturing sector firms with more than 20 employees from 1995 to 2014. The data are supplied by the statistical offces of Germany. As firms are obliged to report by law, the data are of comparably high quality and contain only a negligible amount of missing values. Among others, the data contain information on firm-level costs, investment, revenues, employment, and product prices and quantities. To limit administrative burden, some variables are only collected for a representative and periodically rotating subsample covering $40\\%$ of all manufacturing firms with more than 20 employees. This includes information on intermediate input expenditures or labor costs by various categories.9 The online Appendix C.1 details the definitions of all variables used during my analysis and provides information ondata access.  \n\nBy using such a long time span of firm-level data, I face a problem with respect to the time-consistent classification of firms into industry sectors. This is because the NACE sector classification changed in 2002 and 2008. As I am interested in explaining wage shares with firm-level data over time, and as the procedure to recover output elasticities and market power parameters relies on time-consistent industry codes, having a time-consistent industry classification is vital to my study. Recovering such an industry classification from official concordance tables is, however, problematic as they contain many ambiguous sector reclassifications.  \n\nTo solve this problem, I use information on firms' product mix to classify all firms into NACE rev 1.1 sectors based on their main production activities.10 This procedure works because the first four digits of the nine-digit GP product classification reported in AFiD are identical to the NACE sector classification. Applying this method still demands a consistent reclassification of all products into the GP2002 scheme. Reclassifying products is, however, less ambiguous than reclassifying industries. Moreover, in ambiguous cases, I can follow the firm-specific product mix over the reclassification periods to unambiguously reclassify most products (I observe what firms produce before and after reclassifications). Having constructed the product-industry classification, I attribute every firm to the industry in which it generates most of its revenue. The statistical offices of Germany use a similar approach to classify firms into industries. When comparing my and the statistical offices' classification for the years 2002-2008 (years in which industries are already reported in NACE rev 1.1), I find that my two-digit and four-digit classification of firms into industries respectively matches the statistical offices' classification in $95\\%$ and $86\\%$ of all cases.  \n\nUsing my data, Fig. 1 shows how value-added and revenue wage shares evolved in Germany's manufacturing sector. Between 1995 and 2014, revenue (value-added) wage shares declined by 18 (9) percent, corresponding to an absolute decline of the revenue (value-added) labor share from 0.270 (0.762) to 0.222 (0.692).11  \n\nNote the spike during the crisis in 2009. Intuitively, this phenomenon reflects sticky wage and labor quantity adjustments (i.e. labor hoarding) in response to negative output shocks. The percentagewise stronger decline in the revenue wage share indicates a decrease of firms' value-added depth (the revenue over value-added ratio). However, I focus on potential mechanisms behind changes in labor's share at a later point. Beforehand, the next section shows how labor shares relate to market power and the importance of labor in firms' production processes.  \n\n![](images/f17e6dcd9a5c58c62bfbb8737d3e0b17645e70368a0cd2d57f40a17082ad1d22.jpg)  \nVALUE-ADDED AND REVENUE LABOR SHARES, GERMANMANUFACTURINGSECTOR   \nFig. 1. Value-added and revenue labor shares in the German manufacturing sector. Sample firms.  \n\n## 3. A production-side framework for the labor share  \n\nThis section derives my micro-econometric framework connecting labor shares to labor output elasticities and firms' product and labor market power. Section 3.1 derives key equations for this framework and discusses its assumptions. My approach builds upon Dobbelaere and Mairesse (2013) and DLEU. Section 3.2 links my framework to existing work on rising market power. Section 3.3 explains how I separate the contribution of rising market power and a falling technological importance of labor to a decline in labor's share. Section 3.4 recovers necessary parameters from the data.  \n\n### 3.1. Theoretical framework  \n\nA firm i produces physical output in period $t$ using the production function:  \n\n$$\nQ_{i t}=Q_{i t}(.)=Q_{i t}(L_{i t},K_{i t},M_{i t},).\n$$  \n\n$Q_{i t}$ represents total physical output and $L_{i t},K_{i t}$ , and $M_{i t}$ denote labor, capital, and intermediate inputs used in the production of $Q_{i t}$ . Firm-specific total factor productivity is denoted by $\\omega_{i t}$ . The only restriction on the functional form of (1) is that it is twice differentiable.  \n\nEq. (1) describes a physical production process. A production model transforming physical inputs into physical outputs approximates firms' production technology more closely than a value-added specification, simply because there is no market forvalue-added.12  \n\nFirms demand labor on imperfectly competitive labor markets. Following most of the literature, I assume that intermediate input markets are flexible and that intermediate input prices are exogenous to firms.13 For the remainder, I abstract from capital market imperfections and focus on labor markets imperfections because labor market power will be of key interest when discussing declining labor shares.  \n\nAs shown by a large labor market literature, labor market power $(\\gamma_{i t})$ translates into wedges between marginal revenue products of labor and wages:  \n\n$$\n\\gamma_{i t}=\\frac{M R P L_{i t}}{w_{i t}}.\n$$  \n\n$w_{i t}$ and $M R P L_{i t}$ denote the wage and the marginal revenue product of labor. The existence of such a wedge signals labor market power as it reflects an inefficient distortion of rents towards the firm $(\\gamma_{i t}>1$ )or itsemployees $(\\gamma_{i t}<1)$ .Toprovide more intuition, I present two models on how labor market imperfections translate into labor market power as defined in Eq. (2) in the online Appendix A.  \n\nWith respect to the factors driving labor market power, I stay agnostic. I am interested in the extent of labor market power, its evolution, and distribution across firms, instead of the factors causing it. Yet, I study potential factors creating labor market power in online Appendix H and show that market concentration, firm size, and firms' capital intensity are positively correlated with firm labor market power. Moreover, firms located in regions characterized by a lower union density and a lower rate of collective wage agreements (East Germany) possess higher labor market power conditional on severalcontrols.  \n\nDespite this is consistent with defining $\\gamma_{i t}$ as labor market power, Yit also captures firms' adjustment costs. Firm-side adjustment costs can either be related or unrelated to labor market power. Adjustment costs related to labor market power are the main source of worker-side labor market power because without firms facing hiring/firing frictions, workers cannot bargain for wages above the MRPL (as workers could then be easily replace when starting to bargain). This key concept underlies all models featuring worker-side labor market power and is often modelled as workers coordinating their labor supply, e.g. through unions as in Mcdonald and Solow (1981), or as workers having firm-specific human capital that is costly to build (e.g. Kline et al., 2019). Lately, Garin and Silvério (2019) provided a general theoretical framework illustrating this fact. In my framework that allows for worker- and firm-side labor market power, I want to capture these adjustment costs related to labor market power in Yit:  \n\nConsequently, one could view Eq. (2) not just as an outcome of a static optimization problem, but rather as a first order condition of a (potentially) dynamic problem, where $\\gamma_{i t}$ is a function of all factors creating firm- and worker-side labor market power, including adjustment frictions related to labor market power as well as factors causing firm monopsony power (e.g. concentration, job preferences).14 Nevertheless, a potential concern for my analysis are adjustment frictions unrelated to labor market power. I discuss this further in Section 5 and conclude that it is unlikely that such adjustment costs can explain my findings as I focus on changes over time.  \n\nAs the MRPL is unobserved, I now derive a formula expressing labor market power in terms of observables and describe how labor shares connect to labor output elasticities and product and labor market power. I detail the full derivation in the onlineAppendixB.1.  \n\nI follow De Loecker and Warzynski (2012), who have shown that one can derive a firm's product market power/markup $(\\mu_{i t})$ from its cost-minimization problem by using a first order condition with respect to a flexible input for which prices are exogenous to firms (intermediates):  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{i t}=\\theta_{i t}^{M}\\frac{P_{i t}Q_{i t}}{z_{i t}M_{i t}}\\mathrm{~.~}\n$$  \n\n$P_{i t}$ and $z_{i t}$ denote the firm's output price and unit costs for intermediate inputs. $\\theta_{i t}^{X}$ denotes the output elasticity of input $X=$ $\\{L,M,K\\}.\\mu_{i t}>1$ indicates that the firm possesses product market power. Reformulating Eq. (2) leads to a similar expression (see online Appendix B.1):  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{i t}=\\theta_{i t}^{L}\\frac{P_{i t}Q_{i t}}{w_{i t}L_{i t}}\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{i t}}.\n$$  \n\nEq. (4) looks similar to a standard first order condition for labor from a cost-minimization framework. The key difference is that $\\gamma_{i t}$ additionally captures labor market power. Instead of deriving (4) from reformulating Eq. (2), one can alternatively consider a cost-minimization framework extending the De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) framework to allow for labor market power and derive (2) from the first order condition for labor.15 The online Appendix B.2 provides such a framework.  \n\nCombining (3) and (4) gives a measurable expression for labor market power:  \n\n$$\n\\gamma_{i t}=\\frac{M R P L_{i t}}{w_{i t}}=\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L}}{\\theta_{i t}^{M}}\\frac{z_{i t}M_{i t}}{w_{i t}L_{i t}},\n$$  \n\nFinally, reformulating Eq. (4) gives:  \n\n$$\nL S_{i t}\\equiv\\frac{w_{i t}L_{i t}}{P_{i t}Q_{i t}}=\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L}}{\\mu_{i t}\\gamma_{i t}}.\n$$  \n\nEq. (6) implies that a fall in the wage share in sales $(L S_{i t})$ either results from increasing product market power $(\\mu_{i t})$ increasing labor market power $(\\gamma_{i t})$ , or a decreasing labor output elasticity $(\\theta_{i t}^{L})$ , which reflects the importance of labor in firms' production activities. Within my framework, every factor impacting on firms' labor shares works through one of these three channels. Therefore, reallocation processes and variation in these three parameters explain the entire fall of labor's share in the data.  \n\nMultiplying (6) by the ratio of sales to value-added, $P_{i t}Q_{i t}/V A_{i t}\\equiv\\kappa_{i t}$ , defines the value-added labor share:  \n\n$$\nL S_{i t}^{V A}\\equiv\\frac{w_{i t}L_{i t}}{V A_{i t}}=\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L}\\kappa_{i t}}{\\mu_{i t}\\gamma_{i t}},\n$$  \n\nWhere, under certain conditions, $\\theta_{i t}^{L}\\kappa_{i t}=\\theta_{i t}^{V A L}$ approximates the alue-added output elastity of labor.16 This shows how changes in frms' value-added depth explain the wedge between the changes of $L S_{i t}^{V A}$ and $L S_{i t}$ displayed in Fig. 1.  \n\nFor most of the paper, I focus on the gross output labor share, as it naturally results from the firms' production perspective. Moreover, market power parameters do not necessarily have a theoretical foundation under the value-added concept. For instance, the markup under the value-added concept refers to the value-added price over marginal costs for one unit of value-added and is theoretically related to the price elasticity of demand for value-added. Unless these objects are identical to their gross output counterparts, they are neither part of firms' optimization problems nor of consumers' demand functions. Nevertheless, from an accounting perspective the value-added labor share is informative on the relative importance of labor and capital in firms' production processes and on inequality between suppliers of labor and owners of capital. 1 therefore replicate key results for the value-added labor share concept in online Appendix F.1.  \n\n3.2. Insights from separating market power into labor and product market power  \n\nEqs. (6) and (7) are reminiscent of Hall, 1990 and several recent studies use similar expressions to motivate how rising markups could have contributed to declining labor shares (e.g. De Loecker and Eeckhout, 2020 and DLEU). The key differences between existing work and the framework used here is that I separate firm market power into product and labor market power. From that I assess whether a fall of labor's share coincides with an increase in firms' product or labor market power (or both). Frameworks assuming competitive labor markets abstract from this latter source of firm market power as being a potential driver of falling labor shares.  \n\nMoreover, separating firm market power into product and labor market power is informative on the causes of firm market power as it sheds light on whether it results from product or labor markets. In this context, online Appendix B.3 shows that the baseline market power measure in DLEU, denoted by $\\mu_{i t}^{D L E U}$ , is a function of product and labor market power: $\\mu_{i t}^{D L E U}=((\\theta_{i t}^{M}+\\theta_{i t}^{L})/(\\theta_{i t}^{M}\\gamma_{i t}+\\theta_{i t}^{L}))\\mu_{i t}\\gamma_{i t}$  \n\n### 3.3.The distortion parameter  \n\nUnder competitive product and labor markets, the wage share equals the aggregate labor output elasticity. I term changes in labor's share corresponding to changes in labor's output elasticity as efficient as they reflect optimal adjustments in firms' production processes that (ceteris paribus) are not accompanied by a reduction of aggregate output. Contrary, I term a fall of labor's share as inefficient if it results from increasing market power because firms with factor or product market power demand too little inputs and produce too little output.  \n\nTo assess whether the declining wage share is an efficient (decrease in labor's output elasticity) or an inefficient (increase in product or labor market power) outcome, I compare relative changes in the aggregate labor share with relative changes in the aggregate labor output elasticity (using revenue weights for aggregation):  \n\n$$\n\\psi_{t}\\equiv\\left[\\frac{\\left(\\theta_{t=1995}^{L}-\\theta_{t}^{L}\\right)}{\\theta_{t=1995}^{L}}-\\frac{\\left(L S_{t=1995}-L S_{t}\\right)}{L S_{t=1995}}\\right]100.\n$$  \n\n$(\\theta_{t=1995}^{L}-\\theta_{t}^{L})/\\theta_{t=1995}^{L}$ measures thecounterfactual percentage change in labor's share relativet195 had output and iput market power been constant. This term reflects the change in labor's share solely due to changes in firms' production processes. $\\psi_{t}$ captures every change in labor's share that cannot be explained by a change in labor's output elasticity, which through the lens of this study's framework refers to changes in product and labor market power. If a falling wage share is caused by a rise of firms' output or labor market power, $\\psi_{t}$ declines over time. If this is not the case, the above framework implies that a declining wage share is an efficient outcome.  \n\n### 3.4. Recovering output elasticities  \n\nBefore utilizing Eqs. (3), (5), and (8) to study how changes in labor's share relate to changes in the labor output elasticity and product and labor market power, I must estimate a production function to recover firms' output elasticities. Depending on the functional form of the production function, output elasticities vary between firms and across time. For instance, a Cobb-Douglas specification would produce time-constant and industry-specific output elasticities, which would attribute the entire decline in labor's share to rising market power by construction. To avoid this, I apply a translog model, allowing for time- and firm-specific output elasticities:  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\phi_{i t}^{\\prime}\\pmb{\\beta}+\\omega_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nLower-case letters denote logs. $\\phi_{i t}$ is a vector capturing production inputs and their interactions, $\\beta$ is a vector of coefficients, and $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ is an ii.d. error term.  \n\nProductivity, $\\omega_{i t}$ , is Hicks-neutral and can be influenced by firm actions. The firm knows $\\omega_{i t}$ before choosing its consumption of intermediate inputs. Given the characteristics of German factor markets, I assume that the innovation in productivity is uncorrelated with the input decisions for capital and labor.18 The output elasticity of any input $x_{i t}$ is given by $q_{i t}/\\partial x_{i t}=$ $\\theta_{i t}^{X}$ 19 Changes in $\\theta_{i t}^{X}$ reflect a repositioning of firms on their production function defined by $\\beta$  \n\n\" Due to Hicks-neutrality of $\\omega_{i t}$ and constant parameters $\\beta$ the production model specified above cannot account for factor-augmenting technical change that raises the productivity of specific inputs. Output elasticities can, however, still change due to changes in quality-adjusted relative factor prices, which are also affected by factor-specific technological change that is embodied in new production factors (Grossman and Oberfield, 2021). Nevertheless, irrespective of its causes, changes in output elasticities always reflect a change in firms' mode of production, which is the focus of this study. In Section 5, I discuss alternative production models that, among others, allow the parameters $\\beta$ to vary over time at the industry level. As noted in DLEU , this also captures industry-level factor-augmenting technological and my results are highly robust to this and other specifications.20  \n\nTo recover unbiased and consistent estimates of firms' production function (9), I need to address three identification issues. First, I do not directly observe $\\omega_{i t}$ . Yet, firms' flexible input decisions (intermediate inputs) depend on $\\omega_{i t}$ ,causing a simultaneity problem. Second, I do not observe firm-specific input prices. If input prices are correlated with input choices, estimating (9) without controlling for input price variation across firms causes a bias in the estimated input coefficients. Third, I do not directly observe $q_{i t}$ for multi-product firms as one cannot aggregate product quantities across firms' various products (liters of beverages vs. kilogram of food). Using revenues deflted by an industry-level deflator to approximate $q_{i t}$ is infeasible as this would contaminate my coefficients with an unobserved term related to firms' output price variation. The following subsections describe how I solve these identification issues.  \n\n#### 3.4.1. Accounting for firm-specific price variation  \n\nTo circumvent the problem that $q_{i t}$ is not directly observable for multi-product firms, I follow Eslava et al. (2004) in calculating a firm-specific price index, $\\pi_{i t}$ , from firm-specific product price information. I use this index as a deflator to purge firm revenues (of all firms) from price variation. I detail the calculation of $\\pi_{i t}$ in the online Appendix C.4. With slightly abusing notation, I keep using $q_{i t}$ for the resulting quasi-quantities.  \n\nTo control for unobserved firm input prices, I folow DLGKP and formulate a price-control function from firm-productlevel price information that I add to the production function (9):  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\tilde{\\phi}_{i t}^{\\prime}\\beta+B_{i t}\\Big((\\pi_{i t},m s_{i t},G_{i t},D_{i t})\\times\\phi_{i t}^{c};\\beta\\Big)+\\omega_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}.\n$$  \n\n$B_{i t}(.)=B_{i t}((\\pi_{i t},m s_{i t},G_{i t},D_{i t})\\times\\phi_{i t}^{c};\\beta)$ is a price control function consisting of the firm-specific output price index $(\\pi_{i t}),$ a weighted average of firms' product market revenue shares $(m s_{i t})$ , a headquarter location dummy. $\\left(G_{i t}\\right)$ and a four-digit industry dummy $(D_{i t})$ $\\phi_{i t}^{c}=\\{1;\\tilde{\\phi}_{i t}\\}$ contains two vectors. $\\tilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ includes the same input terms as $\\phi_{i t}$ , either in monetary terms and deflated by an industry-level deflator or already reported in quantities (labor). The tilde indicates that some variables in $\\tilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ are not expressed in true quantities (capital and intermediate inputs). The constant entering $\\phi_{i t}^{c}$ highlights that elements in $B(.)$ enter the price control function linearly and interacted with $\\tilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ (a consequence of the translog production function).  \n\nThe idea behind the price-control function $B(.)$ is that output prices, product market shares, firm location, and firms' industry affliation are informative about firms' input prices. In particular, I assume that product prices and market shares contain information about product quality and that producing high-quality products demands expensive high-quality inputs. As DLGKP discuss, this motivates to include a price control function containing output price and market share information on the right-hand side of the production function to absorb input price variation emerging form input quality differences across firms. Additionally, I include location and four-digit industry dummies into $B(.)$ to absorb remaining differences in local and four-digit industry-specific input prices. Conditional on elements in B(.), I assume that there are no remaining input price differences across firms.21 Although being restrictive, this is a weaker assumption than the one employed in studies without access to firm-level price information and in which it is assumed that firms face identical input and output prices within industries.  \n\nA notable difference between the original approach of DLGKP and the one I apply is that DLGKP estimate product-level production functions, whereas I transfer their framework to the firm-level.22 To do so, I use firm-product-specific sales shares in firms' total product market sales to aggregate firm-product-level information to the firm-level. This assumes that i) such firm aggregates of product quality increase in firm aggregates of product prices and input quality, i) frm-level input costs for inputs entering as deflated expenditures are increasing in firm-level input quality, and ii) product price elasticities are equal across the products of a firm. These or even stronger assumptions are always implicitly invoked when estimating firm-level production functions.  \n\nFinally, note that even if some of the above assumptions do not hold, including the price control function is still best practice. This is because the price control function does not demand that input prices vary between firms with respect to all elements of $B_{i t}(.)$ . The estimation can regularly result in coefficients implying that there is no price variation at all. The attractiveness of a price control function lies in its agnostic view about existence and degree of input price variation.23  \n\n#### 3.4.2. Unobserved productivity and identifying moments  \n\nTo solve the simultaneity problem from firms' flexible input decision being dependent on firms' productivity, I employ a control function approach in the spirit of Olley and Pakes (1996). This approach derives a control function for productivity from inverting the firm's input demand function for a flexible input. I base my control function on firms' input decision for energy and raw materials, $e_{i t}$ , which are components of total intermediate inputs. The inverted demand function for $e_{i t}$ can be written as a function $g_{i t}(.)=g_{i t}(e_{i t},k_{i t},l_{i t},{\\pmb v}_{i t})=\\omega_{i t}$ that defines productivity and depends on $e_{i t}$ , capital, labor, and additional state variables specified in $v_{i t}$ Ideally, $v_{i t}$ should capture a broad set of variables affecting demand for $e_{i t}$ . In my case, this includes a dummy variable for export activity $(E x p_{i t})$ , the logged number of products a firm produces $(N u m p_{i t})$ and the logged average wage it pays. Including the latter absorbs unobserved quality and price differences that shift demand for $e_{i t}$ (De Loecker and Scott, 2016).24  \n\nI assume that productivity follows a first order Markov process that can be shifted by firm actions, implying the law of motion: $\\omega_{i t}=h_{i t}(\\omega_{i t-1},\\mathbf{A}_{i t-1})+\\xi_{i t}=h_{i t}(.)+\\xi_{i t}.\\xi_{i t}$ denotes the innovation in productivity and $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}_{i t}=(E X_{i t},N u m P_{i t})$ reflects that I allow for learning effects from export market participation and (dis)economies of scope to influence productivity. Combining the law of motion for productivity with $g_{i t}(.)$ and substituting everything into (10) gives:  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\tilde{\\phi}_{i t}^{\\prime}\\beta+B_{i t}(.)+h_{i t}(.)+\\xi_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nI estimate Eq. (11) using a one-step estimator as in Wooldridge (2009).25 This estimator uses lagged values of flexible inputs as instruments for their contemporary values to address the dependence of firms' flexible input decisions on realizations of $\\xi_{i t}$ . The identifying moments are given by:  \n\n$$\nE((\\varepsilon_{i t}+\\xi_{i t})\\Upsilon_{i t})=0,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Upsilon_{i t}$ includes lagged interactions of intermediate inputs with labor and capital, contemporary interactions of labor and capital, contemporary location and industry dummies, the lagged output price index, lagged market shares, lagged elements Oof $h_{i t}(.)$ , and lagged interactions of the output price index with production inputs (online Appendix E provides a formal definition of $\\Upsilon_{i t}$  \n\nThese moments allow for output prices to respond to productivity shocks but demand that they are correlated over time. Contrary, decisions about product mix, location, and exit and entry into export markets are quasi-fixed variables. This captures the existence of sunk costs when entering export markets or building new manufacturing facilities.  \n\nI estimate (11) separately for each NACE rev. 1.1 two-digit industry and control for a full set of time dummies. Across all industries, mean (median) output elasticities for capital, labor, and intermediate inputs respectively are 0.11 (0.11), 0.30 (0.31), and 0.64 (0.63). Online Appendix C.2 reports detailed results from the production function estimation.  \n\nHaving estimated the production function, I calculate firms' product and labor market power using Eqs. (3) and (5).26 To account for measurement error when calculating $\\mu_{i t}$ , I apply the error correction of De Loecker and Warzynski (2012), i.e. I project output on a polynomial of variables in $\\tilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ $B_{i t}(.)$ ,and $h_{i t}(.)$ and use the residuals of this auxiliary regression as a correction factor in Eq. (3) (see De Loecker and Warzynski (2012). To ensure that I can compare aggregate statistics, I only keep firms with information for all components of Eq. (6). The final sample consists of 212,159 firm-year observations, for which online Appendix C.2 summarizes key variables of this article.  \n\n![](images/fcb8dcf93953e635796b273aef1f4b42193dfea188ceeaae64e9d05ef93d71aa.jpg)  \nFig. 2.

Results  \n\nThis section presents evidence on the evolution of labor shares, output elasticities, and product and labor market power parameters. Section 4.1 analyzes how product and labor market power relate to firm- and industry-level labor shares. Section 4.2 investigates how my variables of interest change over time. Section 4.3 dissects movements of these variables into within- and between-firm changes. Finally, Section 4.4 discusses the extent to which changes in firms' market power and production processes explain the documented change in labor's share.  \n\n### 4.1. Market power and labor's share  \n\nFig. 2 correlates labor shares with market power parameters at the four-digit industry level. For aggregation I use sales weights for all variables. Alternatively, one can use cost weights to aggregate market power parameters, which I do in online Appendix F.1 (results are unchanged).27  \n\nStandard theory implies that, under competitive labor markets, product market power will reduce labor demand by reducing firms' output. This causes a reduction in wages on an increasing labor supply curve and reduces labor's share. Yet, Fig. 2 shows that industry-level labor shares are positively associated with product market power, but negatively correlated with labor market power. The reason for this is a negative relationship between firms' labor and product market power, implying that firms with high product market power share rents with their employees. These rent-sharing processes even overcompensate the negative effect of product market power on labor shares leading to the positive association between labor shares and product markups.28  \n\nTable 1 shows that this also holds at the firm-level by regressing labor shares on labor output elasticities and market power parameters. Note that I am only interested in the change in the coefficient on $\\mu_{i t}$ after including $\\gamma_{i t}$ . Of course, labor shares are perfectly explained by labor output elasticities and market power parameters. Yet, the change in the coefficient on the product market power parameter is informative on the role of labor market power in linking product market power to labor shares. Table 1 shows that irrespective of whether I rely on cross-sectional or within-firm variation, firms' product market power, $\\mu_{i t}$ , is positively correlated with firms' labor shares when I omit the labor market power parameter, Yit· Conditioning on labor market power drastically reduces the coefficient on $\\mu_{i t}$ , turning it negative. Hence, also at the firmlevel, firms with higher product market power share rents extensively with their employees, leading to higher labor shares within these firms.29  \n\nMy findings are consistent with a rent-sharing model for the German manufacturing sector and demonstrate that an abstraction from labor market imperfections (as often done in the literature) might misguide conclusions on the relationship between product market power and labor shares. The positive association between product market power and labor shares at the firm and industry level is striking given that much of the literature connects product rather than labor market power todeclining labor shares.  \n\nTable1 Labor shares and market power, firm- level analysis.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">Revenuelaborshare</td><td colspan=\"4\">Value-addedlaborshare</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td><td>(8)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.509***</td><td>0.984***</td><td>0.760*** (0.0067)</td><td>0.957***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>OVAL it</td><td>(0.0039)</td><td>(0.0017)</td><td></td><td>(0.0034)</td><td>0.435***</td><td>1.274***</td><td>1.188***</td><td>1.408***</td></tr><tr><td>Mit</td><td>1.881***</td><td>-0.873***</td><td>1.504***</td><td>-0.656***</td><td>(0.0047) 0.849***</td><td>(0.0024) -1.156***</td><td>(0.0048) 1.665***</td><td>(0.0021) -0.714***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.0135)</td><td>(0.0083)</td><td>(0.0180)</td><td>(0.00157)</td><td>(0.0117)</td><td>(0.073)</td><td>(0.0198)</td><td>(0.0152)</td></tr><tr><td>Vit</td><td></td><td>-0.968***</td><td></td><td>-0.925***</td><td></td><td>-1.212***</td><td></td><td>-1.156***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.0021)</td><td></td><td>(0.0049)</td><td></td><td>(0.0027)</td><td></td><td>(0.0044)</td></tr><tr><td>Time FE</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Firm-industry NO</td><td></td><td>NO</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>FE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>212,159</td><td>212,159</td><td>206,103</td><td>206,103</td><td>212,159</td><td>212,159</td><td>206,103</td><td>206,103</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.618</td><td>0.941</td><td>0.950</td><td></td><td>0.265</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Num.firms</td><td>40,778</td><td>40,778</td><td>35,412</td><td>0.977 35,412</td><td>40,778</td><td>0.925 40,778</td><td>0.902 35,412</td><td>0.981 35,412</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table 1 reports results from projecting labor shares on market power parameters at the firm level.

Aggregates of firm-level labor shares, output elasticities of labor, product market power, and labor market power. Sales-weighted aggregates. Red dashed lines show linear trends. Germany's manufacturing sector. Sample firms.  \n\n### 4.2. Aggregate movements  \n\nFig. 3 displays the evolution of manufacturing sector aggregates of labor shares, product market power, labor market power, and labor output elasticities. Again, I focus on sales-weighted results for all variables and report results using costweights for market power parameters in online Appendix F1 (results are qualitatively unchanged).  \n\nThe fall of labor's share $\\mathrm{from}0.27\\$ to 0.22) jointly coincides with a fall of the output elasticity of labor, a moderate increase in product market power and a strong rise in labor market power. The strong decline of labor's output elasticity (from 0.329 to 0.299) implies that labor became less important in firms production processes in past decades. Online Appendix D investigates more into the evolution of output elasticities and discuss movements of industry-level average and aggregate labor, capital, and intermediate input output elasticities. Across almost all industries, labor output elasticities exhibit clear negative time trends, suggesting that the fall in the aggregate labor output elasticity is not a results of reallocation processes between industries. Although decreasing in most industries, capital output elasticities show an overall weaker decline. Most notably, intermediate input output elasticities show a strong increase. Jointly, this suggests an increasing importance of intermediate inputs in firms' production activities which reallocates value-added factor shares away from labor and towards capital. This is exactly what one would expect from an increasing tendency of German manufacturing sector firms to outsource/offshore labor-intensive tasks, as documented in the literature (Sinn, 2006; Goldschmidt and Schmieder, 2017).  \n\nWith respect to the market power parameters, I find that whereas firms' labor market power is high and strongly increasing, firms' product market power, although also increasing, stays on comparably low levels. Aggregate product and labor market power respectively rose from 1.00 to 1.03 and from 1.31 to 1.42, i.e. in 2014, wages were $42\\%$ belowtheMRPL. Labor market power is thus the main source of (growing) firm market power in the German manufacturing sector.  \n\nThe rise of labor market power during the early 2oo0s coincides with the introduction of Germany's major labor market reforms (the “Hartz-reforms\"), which, among others, decreased unemployment benefits and increased the flexibility of labor markets. Moreover, the increase in firms' labor market power coincides with secular falls in the union density and the worker share covered by collectively bargained wage standards over the past decades in Germany (Dustmann et al., 2014; OECD,2017).  \n\n### 4.3. Between- and within-firm changes  \n\nTo understand the mechanisms behind the documented changes, I use a within-between-firm decomposition. The aggregate value, $x_{t}$ ,of any variable, $x_{i t}$ , can be decomposed as follows:  \n\n$$\nx_{t}=\\sum_{i}s_{i t}x_{i t}={\\bar{x}}_{t}+c o\\nu_{t}(x_{i t},s_{i t}),\n$$  \n\nwhere $s_{i t}$ is the weight of economic importance (sales or costs). $\\bar{x}_{t}$ and $c o\\nu_{t}(x_{i t},s_{i t})$ denote the unweighted average of $x_{i t}$ across firms and the covariance between $x_{i t}$ and $s_{i t}$ (Olley and Pakes, 1996).30 Changes in the unweighted average reflect within-firm changes. Changes in the covariance reflect between-firm changes. Fig. 4 displays this decomposition for aggregates of $L S_{i t},\\:\\theta_{i t}^{L},$ $\\mu_{i t}$ . and $\\gamma_{i t}$ . Panel A plots unweighted averages (within-firm contribution). Panel B shows covariance terms (between-firm contribution).  \n\nThe decline in the labor share has a strong within- and between-firm component. For labor's output elasticity, the within-firm component dominates, suggesting that its fall is driven by factors influencing most manufacturing firms similarly (e.g. technological change, outsourcing).31 This is consistent with evidence in online Appendix D showing a decline in (unweighted) average labor output elasticities for almost all two-digit industries and raises doubts on common production models assuming time-constant output elasticities (as most applied Cobb-Douglas specifications).  \n\nThe between-firm component is negative for the labor share and aggregate product market power, whereas slightly positive for labor's output elasticity and strongly positive for aggregate labor market power. Hence, large firms have lower labor shares, less product market power, higher labor output elasticities, and clearly higher labor market power compared to small firms.  \n\nThe covariance term is often interpreted as a reallocation term (e.g. Autor et al., 2020). Yet, besides measuring changes in market shares between firms, it also captures how variables of interest change within firms at different parts of the distribution. For instance, if output elasticities fall most for the largest firms, the covariance between labor output elasticities and market shares declines, even if firm market shares stay constant (Decker et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the covariance term is still informative on the importance of the upper parts of the firm sales (size) distribution in driving aggregate changes. Fig. 4 thus indicates that economic activity becomes increasingly concentrated in firms with lower/declining labor shares, a lower/declining technological importance of labor, higher/increasing product market power, and higher/increasing labor marketpower.  \n\nTo understand the role of reallocation processes more explicitly, online Appendix J splits firms into different employment and revenue size classes and studies the quantitative differences between small and large firms behind the covariance terms. There are three important results from this analysis: First, there is considerable variation in levels of labor shares, output elasticities and market power parameters between firms' of different size. For instance, in 2014, firms in the largest size class (more than 250 full time equivalents (FTE)) have an average labor market power parameter of 1.32, whereas for firms in the smallest size class (not more than 50 FTE) this value is 0.79. Second, economic activity reallocates towards large firms over time. And third, large firms show the strongest decline in labor shares and output elasticities of labor and the strongest rise in labor mark power (results are similar when defining size by sales).  \n\nConsistent with these differences across the firm size distribution, Fig. 4 shows that the unweighted average of the labor market power parameter is much lower than its weighted average (because most firms are small), whereas the covariance between size and labor market power is large and rising.32 Firm size is thus an important determinant of labor market power and high and increasing aggregate labor market power mostly results from large and increasing shares of economic activity being concentrated in firms with high and rising labor market power.  \n\nTable 2 complements Fig. 4 and provides insights on the quantitative importance of between- vs. within-firm changes. For every variable, the first column reports the relative change in its aggregate value.

Germany's manufacturing sectol Samplefirms.  \n\nthe within- and between-firm contribution to this change. For instance, the aggregate labor share declined by $8.59\\%$ $(9.25\\%)$ due to within-firm (between-firm) dynamics, showing a similar importance of the within- and between-firm component.  \n\nTable 3 displays how cross-industry dynamics affect aggregate changes by showing results from a 2-digit-industry version of the within-between decomposition in Eq. (14). As can be seen, aggregate changes in labor shares, labor output elasticities, and product market power are mainly driven by within-industry changes. For labor market power, I find that within-industry changesaccount for $35\\%$ of the aggregate increase, whereas between-industry changes contribute with $65\\%$  \n\nFinally, online Appendix K provides further insights on within-industry dynamics and conducts the firm-level decomposition exercise for each industry separately. Most industries show changes in labor shares, labor output elasticities, and product market power that are similar to the aggregate changes in these variables. For labor market power, there is, however, large variation across industries, with almost half of them showing declining labor market power. Yet, this is consistent with Table 3 highlighting a particular importance of between-industry changes in explaining increasing labor market power in the German manufacturing sector.  \n\n### 4.4. Rise of market power vs. efficient sources of declining labor shares  \n\nUsing Eq. (8), Fig. 5 shows how the aggregate wedge $(\\psi_{t})$ between changes in the labor share and the aggregate output elasticity of labor evolved between 1995 and 2014. The level of $\\psi_{t}$ is depicted on the left vertical axis. The evolution of $\\psi_{t}$ (blue solid line), reflects the percentage change in labor's share due to increasing firm labor and product market power.  \n\nAlthough not visible from Fig. 5, we know from comparing $\\theta_{t}^{L}$ (0.329) and $L S_{t}$ (0.270) (Fig. 3) that already in 1995, labor shares were below their counter factual level of competitive output and input markets. Over the following decades, the wedge between movements in $\\theta_{t}^{L}$ and $L S_{t}$ widens. In 2014, $\\psi_{t}$ reaches a value of $-8.71$ . indicating that the labor share fell by $8.71\\%$ due to increasing firm market power. As the labor share fell by $17.85\\%$ . this implies that increasing product and labor market power account for $49\\%$ of the documented decline in the wage share. The remaining $51\\%$ are explained by firms moving towards less labor-intensive production processes (labor's output elasticity dropped by $17.85\\%-8.71\\%=9.14\\%)$  \n\nThe online Appendix F.1 replicates Fig. 5 for the value-added labor share using the approximation $\\theta_{i t}^{V A L}=\\theta_{i t}^{L}\\kappa_{i t}$ and finds comparable results: the increase (fall) in aggregate market power (the value-added output elasticity of labor) explains $56\\%$ $(44\\%)$ of the declining value-added labor share (see online Appendix F1 for details). In sum, for both labor share concepts, increasing firm market power and a decreasing technological importance of labor each account for half of the documented decline in labor's share. The is in line with findings for the global labor share based on macroeconomic data (Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2013).  \n\nGiven that I only find slightly increasing product market power, but strongly rising labor market power levels, my estimates imply that most of the contribution of market power to the decline in labor's share results from increasing firm labor market power.33 To highlight the key role of rising firm labor market power, the dashed black line in Fig. 5 displays invers values of the aggregate labor market power parameter (levels are represented on the right vertical axis), uncovering a striking similarity between movements in aggregate labor market power and the distortion parameter, $\\psi_{t}$  \n\nThe documented rise of labor market power begs questions about its policy implications and implies room for policies that reduce market distortions and increase labor's share. Guiding policies naturally depends on a variety of aspects. If political decisions makers, however, agree on targeting firms' labor market power, the design of appropriate policies depends on the underlying distribution of market power across firms. In case of Germany's manufacturing sector, labor market power is concentrated in large firms and high and increasing labor market power results from a positive and increasing covariance between firms' share of economic activity and labor market power. Consequently, policies targeting all firms equally or small firms especially are ineffective in reducing aggregate labor market power. A suitable policy to reduce firms' labor market power could therefore extend the existing antitrust law, which currently focuses on preventing excessive product market power, to address the prevalence of market power in labor markets (see also Naidu et al., 2018).  \n\n## 5. Discussion and robustness checks  \n\n### 5.1. Discussion: adjustment costs and labor market power  \n\nLabor market power is measured as the wedge between wages and marginal revenue products of labor. Therefore, one concern could be that my labor market power measure captures adjustment frictions unrelated to labor market power instead of labor market power. Recap first that adjustment frictions related to labor market power (e.g. training costs, unions coordinating labor supply) are a precondition for the existence of worker-side labor market power and should thus enter the labor market power measure I derive. This differs from studies focusing on monopsony power only, which assume that there is no worker-side labor market power (e.g. Hershbein et al., 2019). Moreover, as I focus on changes of labor market power, I only require that any unobserved labor adjustment costs unrelated to labor market power are not explaining the documented increase in labor market power.  \n\nAs adjustment costs unrelated to labor market power are unobserved, I cannot directly test whether they are a relevant driver of my labor market power measure. Yet, my results provide strong suggestive evidence that the increase in labor market power is not driven by adjustment costs unrelated to labor market power. First, firm labor market power is much higher in large firms (Section 4.3, online Appendix J). Yet, it is well documented that, in Germany, large firms find it much easier than small firms to fill open vacancies (Dettmann et al., 2019). Hence, if adjustment frictions unrelated to labor market power would be a main driver of my labor market power measure, small firms should have higher labor market power than large firms. But the opposite is true. Second, my period of analysis spans several decades of innovations (e.g. broad band internet, online job search engines) and investments in infrastructure (high speed train connections) that reduce information frictions and increase the possibilities of finding suitable worker-firm matches. This should decrease labor adjustment costs. Yet, my labor market power measure strongly rises over these years. Third, Germany experienced large labor market reforms in 20o5 (Harz reforms) that increased the flexibility of the labor market and reduced unemployment benefits. This should decrease firms' labor adjustment frictions and increase firms' labor market power. Supporting my interpretation, Fig. 3 shows that my labor market power measure strongly rose after 2o05. Finally, in online Appendix H, I correlate my labor market power measure with market concentration and firms being located in regions characterized by a lower union density and smaller share of workers covered by collectively bargained wage agreements (East Germany) and find a highly statistically significant positive association between my labor market power measure and these two proxies for firms' monopsony power and low levels of worker bargaining power. Beyond that, using the same labor market power measure, Dobbelaere, et al. (2020) show that German firms' labor market power, is negatively correlated with the presence of collective bargaining, the presence of work councils, and firm wage premia (wage differences after conditioning on human capital and worker skills) at the firm level.  \n\nOverall, these data patterns and findings support my interpretation of increases in $\\gamma_{i t}$ as rising labor market power.  \n\n### 5.2. Replication using alternative production models  \n\nThis section replicates my main results for five alternative production models. Across all these models, I find strong support for my key findings. Whereas I focus on the results in this section, the online Appendices F.2-F.5 present all associated graphs and discuss the individual production models in detail. Table 4 presents an overview on the changes in aggregate measures of labor's output elasticity, firms' product market power and firms' labor market power for all production models I estimated. The results are derived from comparing point estimates of 1995 and 2014 and thus might under- or overstate trends (see online Appendices F.2-F.5).  \n\nTable4 Changes in aggregates of labor output elasticities, product market power, and labor market power across different production models   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Baseline (1)</td><td>CD-Fix (2)</td><td>CD-Flex (3)</td><td>TimeCD (4)</td><td>TL-Flex (5)</td><td>TL-WoP (6)</td></tr><tr><td>Outputelasticityof</td><td>0.33 to 0.30</td><td>0.30 to 0.30</td><td>0.28 to 0.28</td><td>0.26 to 0.24</td><td>0.35 to 0.32</td><td>0.28 to 0.24</td></tr><tr><td>labor Labormarketpower</td><td>(-0.030) 1.31 to 1.42</td><td>(+0.007) 1.28 to 1.73</td><td>(+0.003) 1.22to 1.62</td><td>(-0.021) 1.08to1.30</td><td>(-0.027) 1.35to 1.50</td><td>(-0.040) 1.00 to1.04</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(+0.102)</td><td>(+0.446)</td><td>(+0.397)</td><td>(+0.225)</td><td>(+0.150)</td><td>(+0.034)</td></tr><tr><td>Productmarketpower</td><td>1.00 to 1.03 (+0.039)</td><td>1.02 to 0.97 (-0.048)</td><td>1.04 to0.99 (-0.049)</td><td>1.10to 1.06 (-0.035)</td><td>1.01 to 1.05</td><td>1.12 to 1.14</td></tr><tr><td>declininglaborshare</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(+0.039)</td><td>(+0.018)</td></tr><tr><td>Marketpower</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>49%</td><td>112%</td><td>105%</td><td>54%</td><td>57%</td><td>22%</td></tr><tr><td>contributionto</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table 4 reports changes in aggregates of labor output elasticities, product market power, and labor market power across different production models. Column 1 shows results for the baseline specification. Columns 2 and 3 use a Cobb-Douglas specification with time-constant output elasticities, respectively with quasi-fixed and flexible labor inputs. Column 4 shows results for a time-varying Cobb-Douglas specification. Column 5 uses the baseline specification with allowing for flexible labor inputs. Column 6 uses the baseline specification but ignores firm-specific price variation.  \n\nColumn 1 refers to the baseline specification used in the main text. Columns 2 and 3 start with the simplest possible model: a Cobb-Douglas (CD) production model featuring constant and industry-specific output elasticities. CD-fix assumes quasi-fixed labor inputs, whereas CD-flex assumes flexible labor inputs (i.e. labor responds to productivity shocks). Given constant and industry-specific output elasticities, these models mostly shut down changes in the aggregate labor output elasticity by design. Under these CD specifications, changes in labor's output elasticity can only be caused by a reallocation of market shares between industries or changes in the firm composition. Such changes are small and, if anything, contribute to a slight increase in labor's output elasticity. Thus, by design, both CD models conclude that the increase in market power explains the entire fall in labor's share. The two models are, however, informative on the role of labor as opposed to product market power in explaining falling labor shares: As firms' product market power decreases under these models, they suggest that the entire fall of the wage share results from increasing labor market power. The strong divergence between labor and product market power in these models implies a dramatic reduction in labor compared to intermediate input expenditures over time because output elasticities are held constant in these models.  \n\nIn column 4, I use a time-varying CD model which produces industry-specific and time-varying output elasticities by estimating the production separately for each year.34 This specification addresses concerns about a functional form dependence between my baseline estimate of labor's output elasticity and labor input levels. A result from such a dependence could be a hard-wired link between movements in labor's share and labor's output elasticity. The time-varying CD model is not subject to this concern. Additionally, the time-varying CD model allows for an limited form of industryspecific factor-augmenting technological change in firms' production processes (DLEU, p.628) . Recent work argues that accounting for factor-augmenting technological change is important when estimating production functions and market power (Doraszelski and Jaumandreu, 2018; Demirer, 2020; Raval, 2020).35 Yet, a particular issue with approaches to account for factor-augmenting technological change is that they assume exogenous wages to firms, which is unsuitable in my case and rejected by the literature for a plethora of datasets (e.g. Card et al., 2018; Manning, 2021). When allowing for imperfectly competitive labor markets, a time-varying production function specification is therefore the best available robustness check to test for the importance of factor-augmenting technological change in driving my results.36 Note that, just as my baseline translog production function, the time-varying CD production function does also capture changes in quality-adjusted relative factor prices because this model does not restrict why output elasticities differ between years.  \n\nIn line with my baseline specification, I find a decrease in labor's output elasticity from the time-varying CD model. Labor market power shows an increase comparable to my baseline model, whereas product market power decreases. Latter implies no role for product market power in contributing to the decline of labor's share. Overall, increasing firm market power and a falling technological importance of labor respectively account for $54\\%$ and $46\\%$ of the decline in labor's share under a time-varying CD model, which is close to my baseline results. Hence, even when allowing for (industry-specific) factor-augmenting technological change, rising labor market power explains half of the documented decline in labor's share.  \n\nDespite the time-varying CD model cannot capture firm-specific biased technological change, this finding is reassuring and suggest that the increase in labor market power is not just reflecting unmeasured biased technological change. Otherwise, one should expect at least a small reduction in the relative importance of labor market power.  \n\nNevertheless, this does not imply that technological change does not matter for changes in firms. production processes (firms' labor output elasticities). Technological change can be embodied in new types of inputs and change quality-adjusted relative factor prices (Grossman and Oberfield, 2021). This type of technological change is captured in my translog and the time-varying CD production function and is also emphasized to be a main driver of declining global labor shares in Karabarbounis and Neiman (2013).  \n\nThe similarity between my baseline and the time-varying Cobb-Douglas specification is also consistent with evidence in Demirer (2020). Although there are several countries where he found a significant difference between a translog production function and a specification allowing for factor-augmenting technological change, he also reported that for some countries differences in parameter estimates where quantitatively small (Demirer, 2020, p. 96).  \n\nColumn 5 estimates a translog model allowing for labor to respond to productivity shocks, which addresses concerns about my timing assumptions for the labor input. Whereas the estimated changes in the variables of interest are similar to the baseline model, this model estimates a slightly stronger increase in firms' labor market power. Yet, the results are closely in line with my baseline estimates.  \n\nFinally, column 6 adds a translog production model where I ignore firm-specific price variation. Due to data constraints, this is also often done in the literature. As discussed, ignoring firm-specific price variation introduces a bias in market power parameters and output elasticities. Ignoring firm price variation i) reduces firm labor market power and moderates its rise, i) increases product market power, i) strengthens the fall of labor's output elasticity, and iv) leads to a much larger importance of a falling labor output elasticity in explaining the documented fall in labor's share. Notably, the reported change in labor (product) market power hides a stronger upward (a negative) trend in this measure (see online Appendix F5).  \n\nGiven the results in Table 4, I view my baseline model as a conservative benchmark that is supported by the other models. Across all models, I find that i) if I allow for firm- or industry-specific labor output elasticities to vary over time, the aggregate labor output elasticity declines, i) changes in product market power are small, and i) the increase in labor marker power dominates the increase in product market power. Moreover, excluding the last model, labor market power levels are clearly above product market power levels. Overall, Table 4 demonstrates that my results on the fall of the aggregate labor output elasticity and the severe increase in aggregate firm labor market power are strong and irrefutable features of the data.  \n\nAs I further show in online Appendices F.2-5, reoccurring findings across all specifications are that i) the labor output elasticity falls mostly due to within-firm changes, ii) there is a close co-movement between the contribution of market power to the declining labor share and the invers of labor market power, highlighting the key role of labor market power in explaining changes in labor's share, and i) high and increasing aggregate labor market power results from large firms possessing high labor market power and gaining increasingly higher levels of labor market power and larger market shares.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nThis article sheds light on mechanisms behind declining labor shares. The micro-econometric framework of this article offers three competing explanations for a fall of labor's share: an increase in firms' product market power, an increase in firms' labor market power, or falling labor output elasticities, which reflects a decreasing importance of labor in firms' production activities.  \n\nI apply my framework to data on German manufacturing sector firms containing information on firm-specific prices, allowing me to account for firm price variation when estimating output elasticities and market power parameters. Coinciding with the decline of the labor share, I find a high and severely increasing degree of aggregate firm labor market power. In contrast, firms' product market power, although increasing, stays low. Hence, labor market power is the main source of (increasing) firm market power in the German manufacturing sector. Increasing firm market power accounts for one half of the observed decline in the labor share. Given my market power estimates, I conclude that most of this contribution of market power to the declining labor share results from increasing firm labor market power. The remaining half is explained by a declining aggregate labor output elasticity which implies a vital role for changing production processes in explaining the fall of labor's share and which raises doubts on production models featuring constant output elasticities of production factors.  \n\nTwo important aspects that this article highlights are that large firms possess particularly high labor market power and that most of the rise in aggregate labor market power results from a growth of labor market power in large firms and a reallocation of market shares towards high labor market power firms. Understanding whether such changes are taking place also outside of the German manufacturing sector and, if so, why large firms can capture increasingly large labor market rents and what this implies for the macroeconomy are relevant questions for future research.  \n\n## Supplementary materials  \n\nSupplementary material associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at doi:10.1016/jijindorg.2021. 102808.  \n\n## References  \n\nAcemoglu, D., 2003.

I develop a framework for measuring such labor market power distortions in monetary terms and document large degrees of these distortions in Germany's manufacturing sector. Import competition only exerts labor market disciplining effects if firms, rather than employees, possess labor market power. Otherwise, increasing export demand and import competition both fortify existing distortions, which decreases labor market efficiency.

INTRODUCTION  \n\nTHE RAPID AND ONGOING PROCESS OF GLOBALIZATION creates profound challenges for firms operating in the market economy. Global integration has increased the size of firms’ product markets and the amount of their competitors, while global production networks and dramatically falling transportation costs redefine the nature of production activities. How firms respond to these new market conditions has fundamental implications for domestic workers, productivity levels, and living standards.  \n\nTraditionally, most research studying firm responses to trade exposure relies on perfectly functioning labor markets. By design, this limits the analyses to scenarios where wages are always on competitive levels and where firms do fully pass gains and losses from trade exposure through to labor expenditure adjustments. Recent work, however, has raised awareness to the role of imperfect functioning labor markets for understanding firms’ responses to trade exposure: By affecting how firms adjust to changes in product and input market conditions, labor market imperfections may alter distributional outcomes from trade and may change aggregate trade gains compared to a baseline scenario with competitive labor markets (e.g. Egger & Kreickemeier (2009); Kambourov (2009); Dix-Carneiro (2014). Therefore, understanding how international trade interacts with labor market imperfections has a first order priority in evaluating welfare effects and distributional impacts from trade.  \n\nIn this article, I contribute to this understanding by using a simple micro-econometric partial equilibrium framework to study how final product trade causally affects and interacts with labor market power distortions in the German manufacturing sector. The production side framework of this article does not depend on specific product market demand characteristics and identifies distortions in labor markets by firm-level wedges between workers’ output contributions and wages.2 The existence of such wedges reflects market power in labor markets that affects distributional outcomes and signals market inefficiencies that decrease aggregate output compared to a scenario with competitive labor markets (Petrin & Sivadasan (2013)).  \n\nIntuitively, final product trade has the potential to affect and interact with labor market power distortions through various channels: Trade influences firms’ labor demand and gives an impetus for reorganizing existing structures within firms as well as for reallocating labor between firms (Caliendo & Rossi-Hansberg (2012); Mayer, Melitz, & Ottaviano (2014)). On the other hand, existing labor market power distortions create adjustment barriers (e.g. employment protection agreements) and influence rent sharing processes between firms and employees. This might determine how firms adjust their labor expenses when being exposed to foreign competition and demand. Yet, how international trade influences labor market imperfections, to what extent prevalent labor market power distortions determine distributional outcomes from trade, and whether trade exposure can function as a disciplining tool for distorted labor markets remain open empirical questions that this study answers.  \n\nWhile doing so, this article adds two new insights to the literature. First, it presents new evidence on the causal effect of final product trade on firms' labor market power. This contributes to our understanding on how trade related changes in product market conditions influence rent sharing processes between employees and their firms. Second, this study presents first empirical results on the causal effect of final product trade on market inefficiencies emerging from imperfect labor markets. This offers insights on potential gains and losses from trade, and more generally, from changes in product market competition and demand, in terms of labor market efficiency - a topic on which our knowledge is rather limited, so far.  \n\nMy main results document that an increase in export demand strengthens the labor market power of firms, whereas final product import competition increases employees?  \n\nlabor market power. When uncovering the mechanisms behind these effects, I find that existing structures of labor market power prevent a complete adjustment of firms? labor expenses. Firms with labor market power do not fully pass export profit gains through to workers, whereas firms facing a workforce with positive labor market power cannot fully adjust to import competition by shrinking or lowering wages. These incomplete pass-through processes increase existing labor market distortions and, therefore, decrease the efficiency of labor markets. Hence, due to imperfect labor market adjustments, final product trade can increase gaps between realized and potential output, which prevents a full realization of classical gains from trade under counterfactually competitive labor markets. In addition, I find that import competition might exert labor market disciplining effects, if firms rather than employees possess labor market power. Yet, these disciplining effects are sensitive to the empirical specification.  \n\nTo conduct my analysis, I use administrative firm-product-level data for the German manufacturing sector. I exploit the eight-digit product-level information in this data to calculate exceptionally fine measures of final product import competition and export opportunities for each individual firm. Measuring trade flows at the firm rather than the industry level reduces mismeasurement in the explanatory variables, creates additional identifying variation, and accounts for multi-product firms being active in multiple industries. In line with most of the literature, the analysis of this article focuses on trade with China, whose unexpected and rapid rise to dominance in the global market constitutes an epochal shift in product market conditions for firms throughout the world (especially in the manufacturing sector) and offers an excellent playing field to study how international trade effects domestic firms and markets (Autor, Dorn, & Hanson (2016). To draw causal inferences, I instrument my trade measures in the spirit of  \n\nAutor, Dorn, & Hanson (2013) and Dauth, Findeisen, & Sidekum (2014) by using trade flows between China and countries similar to Germany.  \n\nThis study connects to the recent discussion on the prevalence and causes of high and rising market power put forward by De Loecker & Eeckhout (2018) and De Loecker, Eeckhout, & Unger (2018). Much of the current discussion on the extent of firm market power focuses on product markets. In contrast, this study belongs to a fast-growing literature that investigates the extent of market power on labor markets as an alternative source of firm market power (e.g. Ashenfelter, Farber, & Ransom (2010); Azar, Marinescu, & Steinbaum (2017); Berger, Herkenhoff, & Mongey (2019)). There are growing concerns that labor market power creates substantial welfare losses that are comparable or even larger than welfare losses from product market power (Naidu, Posner, & Weyl (2018); Berger et al. (2019) In response, recent research in economic law calls for extending existing antitrust regulations, which currently mostly focus on preventing excessive product market power, to address the prevalence of market power in labor markets (e.g. Marinescu & Posner (2018)). With this study I contribute to this young literature, by offering evidence on final product trade as a determinant of labor market power. While most of the recent work on labor market power emphasizes the presence of monopsonistic firm market power, I show that worker-side labor market power is also a key factor in shaping firm responses to changes in product competition and demand. In particular, I find that the existence of employee labor market power, similar to the existence of firm labor market power, creates efficiency losses from (trade related) changes in product market conditions.  \n\nThis study also ties into the literature investigating how international trade affects wage bargaining processes. Rodrik (1997) already noted that imported products substitute domestic with foreign workers, weakening the position of the former within the firm. Moreover, Hornstein, Krusell, & Violante (2005) provide evidence that competitive pressure may lead to deunionisation. Most closely related to this paper, Boulhol, Dobbelaere, & Maioli (2011） find a negative impact of imports from developed countries on workers? bargaining power for the UK, while Nesta & Schiavo (2018), by focusing on the subset of firms within an efficient bargaining regime, find the same for imports from China and OECD countries in the case of France. Similarly, Ahsan & Mitra (2014) document that a reduction in output tariffs is associated with a decrease in workers? bargaining power for India. However, my study complements all mentioned contributions in several aspects. First, in contrast to this study, existing work focuses on distributional aspects and does not investigate the causal link between labor market efficiency and international rade. Second, I do not restrict my analysis to import competition. In fact, I find that labor market distortions react several times stronger to an increase in foreign demand than to an increase in import competition. Third, my results show that final product trade interacts with existing structures of labor market distortions and tends to fortify prevalent labor market power levels. This is reflected in a widening of existing positive and negative firm-level gaps between marginal products and wages and is exactly the source of losses in terms of labor market efficiency from final product trade.  \n\nFinally, this article complements recent work discussing how incomplete passthrough processes of trade related productivity gains to consumer prices give rise to output market distortions. De Loecker, Goldberg, Khandewal, & Pavcnik (2016, henceforth DLGKP) find that Indian firms do not fully pass productivity gains from cheaper imported intermediate products through to consumer prices, increasing firmmarkups. Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson, & Rodriguez-Clare (2018) show that under non-homotheticity in preferences it is unclear whether trade integration increases or decreases output market distortions. Weinberger (2017) illustrates this by incorporating a possible non-optimal market share reallocation into the Melitz (2003) model. In his model, heterogeneous output market power allows firms to heterogeneously pass productivity gains from cheaper imported inputs through to consumer prices. Through this mechanism, more productive firms increase their markups relatively more, which reallocates production to the less efficient firms, giving rise to misallocation.  \n\nMy study transfers these findings for output market distortions to labor markets. Closely related to this literature, I find that the underlying mechanism giving rise to labor market distorting effects from trade is based on an incomplete pass-through of firm profit changes to workforce adjustments. That final product trade has the potential to worsen the efficiency of labor markets is an alarming finding, as it implies that models assuming competitive labor markets might overestimate the gains from trade.  \n\nThe remainder proceeds as follows. Chapter 2 describes the data and explains the construction of trade measures. Chapter 3 derives the framework for measuring labor market power distortions. Chapter 4 presents the empirical results. Chapter 5 concludes.  \n\n## 2. DATA DESCRIPTION AND CALCULATING TRADE MEASURES  \n\nI use yearly administrative data on German manufacturing sector firms over the period 2000-2014 from the AFiD-database.3 The data is supplied by the statistical offices of Germany and consists of i) a firm-level panel for the years 2000-2014, containing, among others, data on expenditures, output, employment, and investment, and ii) a firm-product-level panel for the period 1995-2014, supplying information on quantities and prices for firms’ products.  \n\nAFiD is limited to firms with at least 20 employees. To reduce administrative burden, some variables of the firm-level panel are only available for a representative and periodically rotating subsample encompassing roughly $40\\%$ of firms with at least 20 employees. Among others, this contains expenditures on intermediate inputs or employment in full time equivalents (FTE). As this subsample is stratified by size-class and industry, which are variables that I observe for all firms, I can use inverse probability weights to translate all of my regression results to the underlying population of German manufacturing sector firms (with at least 20 employees).  \n\nBilateral trade flow data comes from the United Nations Comtrade Database (comtrade). I merge the comtrade and AFiD data at the product level. This allows me to calculate final product trade measures at the firm-product level by using information on firms' product mix.  \n\nIn some cases, export values reported in comtrade exceed domestic production reported in AFiD, which could be a result of the reporting threshold of the AFiD data. Therefore, I follow Mion & Zhu (2013) and define Chinese product-level import competion. $I M_{g t}^{C H N\\rightarrow G E R}$ , as the period $t$ share of product $g$ imports from China to Germany, $M_{g t}^{C H N\\rightarrow G E R}$ , in the sum of Germany's total imports and total domestic production of product $g$ (from plants with at least 20 employees), respectively denoted by $M_{g t}$ and $Y_{g t}$  \n\n$$\nI M_{g t}^{C H N\\rightarrow G E R}=\\frac{M_{g t}^{C H N\\rightarrow G E R}}{M_{g t}+Y_{g t}}\\ast100.\n$$  \n\nComplementarily, I define export opportunities for German products as:  \n\n$$\nE X_{g t}^{G E R\\rightarrow C H N}=\\frac{E_{g t}^{G E R\\rightarrow C H N}}{M_{g t}+Y_{g t}}*100.\n$$  \n\nwhere $E_{g t}^{G E R\\rightarrow C H N}$ denotes product $g$ exports from Germany to China. As Idiscuss in my empirical section, I instrument these two measures with trade flows between China and countries similar to Germany. I aggregate all product-level trade flow measures to the firm level by using firm-specific product revenue shares in firms’ total product market revenue as weights. I denote the resulting firm-level measures by $I M P_{i t}^{C H N}$ and $E X P_{i t}^{C H N}$ plo thevlution of my trade masures and report mean alues by industry for them in the online Appendix A. To provide a better overview on the data, the online Appendix A additionally reports detailed summary statistics for key variables based on my final sample of firms.  \n\n## 3. A FRAMEWORK TO ESTIMATE LABOR MARKET POWER  \n\nThis section describes the framework to estimate firm-specific labor market power parameters. Section 3.1 derives a monetary quantifiable expression for labor market power distortions. I discuss the interpretation of this parameter in section 3.2. Section 3.3 continues with a detailed treatment of the production function estimation needed to calculate firm-specific labor market power parameters.  \n\n### 3.1  Deriving an expression for labor market power distortions  \n\nA firm $i$ at period $t$ produces output using the production function:  \n\n$$\nQ_{i t}=Q_{i t}(.)=Q_{i t}(L_{i t},M_{i t},K_{i t},\\omega_{i t}),\n$$  \n\nwhere $Q_{i t}$ denotes total physical output and $L_{i t},M_{i t}$ , and $K_{i t}$ respectively are labor, intermediate, and capital inputs used in the production of $Q_{i t}.~\\omega_{i t}$ denotes total factor productivity. The only restriction on the functional form of $Q_{i t}(.)$ that I impose is that it is continuous and twice differentiable with respect to its arguments. Active firms maximize short run profits and face time- and firm-specific unit input cost for any input $X=\\{L,K,M\\}$ ，denoted by $V_{i t}^{X}$ . Intermediate inputs are flexible and firms take intermediate input prices as given. Contrary, labor and capital markets are imperfect. Hence, these inputs markets are subject to distortions that create wedges between firms′ marginal costs and marginal products. Importantly, as shown by Petrin & Sivadasan (2013), such micro-level wedges signal market inefficiencies that reduce aggregate output (see the discussion below).  \n\nAs I am interested in labor market imperfections, I now focus on labor markets. I introduce  labor market distortions  as  monetary  wedges, $\\delta_{i t}^{L}\\equiv f_{i t}(\\pmb{S}_{i t})$ ，between observed wages and marginal revenue products of labor (MRPL):  \n\n$$\nf_{i t}(S_{i t})=\\delta_{i t}^{L}=V_{i t}^{L}-M R P L_{i t}.\n$$  \n\n$s_{i t}$ captures the sources of labor market distortions and describes their mapping into deviations from the competitive labor market scenario $(V_{i t}^{L}=M R P L_{i t})$ 0.As I discuss in section 3.2, I follow a large labor market literature and interpret these wedges as a sign of labor market power (see Dobbelaere & Mairesse (2013) and the literature cited therein).  \n\nIf labor market power distortions were solely resulting from firms’ wage setting power (i.e. a monopsonistic labor market), observed wages would be given by $V_{i t}^{L}=$  \n\n$M R P L_{i t}+f_{i t}(\\varepsilon_{i t}^{L})$ , with $f_{i t}(\\pmb{S}_{i t})=f_{i t}(\\varepsilon_{i t}^{L})<0$ and $\\varepsilon_{i t}^{L}$ denoting the supply elasticity of labor (see the online Appendix B.2). However, as labor market power distortions are an outcome of various frictions, limiting the analyses to the monopsonistic labor market model as above is restrictive. For instance, $f_{i t}(\\pmb{S}_{i t})$ may also depend on the presence of hiring and firing costs, search frictions, inflexible contracts, imperfect information, or the presence of trade unions. Therefore, I do not restrict $f_{i t}(\\pmb{S}_{i t})$ to a specific set of frictions and stay agnostic about the underlying causes of labor market power.  \n\nConsequently, my approach nests various labor market models, including models generating an outcome where $V_{i t}^{L}>M R P L_{i t}$ . The latter may result from an efficient bargaining regime, where unions have some degree of bargaining power, $\\phi_{i t}$ , and wages (and employment) result from a Nash-bargaining between firms and unions: $V_{i t}^{L}=$ $M R P L_{i t}+f_{i t}(\\phi_{i t},\\Pi_{i t})$ , with $\\Pi_{i t}$ denoting profits and $f_{i t}(\\phi_{i t},\\Pi_{i t})>0$ (see the online Appendix B.2).  \n\nThe problem in using equation (4) is to recover a consistent measure of $M R P L_{i t}$ .To circumvent this problem, I follow Dobbelaere & Mairesse (2013) in using the intermediate input market as a competitive benchmark to express $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ as a function of measurable variables:  \n\n$$\n\\delta_{i t}^{L}=V_{i t}^{L}-\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L}}{\\theta_{i t}^{M}}*\\frac{V_{i t}^{M}M_{i t}}{L_{i t}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\theta_{i t}^{X}$ denotes the output elasticity with respect to input $X.\\mathrm{~I~}$ detail the derivation in the online Appendix B.1.  \n\nAssuming competitive intermediate input markets to identify labor market distortions builds upon a large literature on estimating markups and firm productivity by control function approaches in which this assumption is key to ensure identification. In my results section, I address potential concerns about biases introduced by non-competitive intermediate input markets when estimating the impact of final product trade on $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ Besides that, I present suggestive evidence supporting the usage of intermediate input markets as competitive benchmark in the online Appendix C.  \n\nEquation (5) can be linked to the framework of Dobbelaere & Mairesse (2013), in   \nWwhich abor marke distorins are given by thediferene belwen $\\mu_{i t}^{M}=\\theta_{i t}^{M}*\\frac{P_{i t}Q_{i t}}{V_{i t}^{M}M_{i t}}$   \nand $\\mu_{i t}^{L}=\\theta_{i t}^{L}*\\frac{P_{i t}Q_{i t}}{V_{i t}^{L}L_{i t}}$ Here, $\\mu_{i t}^{M}$ and $\\mu_{i t}^{L}$ respetively denotethefim's marku derived from its input decision for intermediates and labor using the framework of De Loecker & Warzynski (2012). To see the similarity between the approach in this article and the framework of Dobbelaere & Mairesse (2013), note that equation (5) can be rewritten as $\\begin{array}{r}{\\delta_{i t}^{L}=V_{i t}^{L}-\\frac{\\mu_{i t}^{L}}{\\mu_{i t}^{M}}V_{i t}^{L}}\\end{array}$ the value of $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ (the online Appendix B.1 provides a discussion). The advantage of the approach in this study is that I express labor market power distortions in monetary terms, which enables intuitive interpretations.  \n\n### 3.2  Labor market power, adjustment frictions, and market inefficiencies  \n\n$\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ captures the extent to which labor market imperfections, separately from product market imperfections, drive a wedge between marginal products of labor and wages. When $\\delta_{i t}^{L}>0$ , wages are higher than workers’ output contribution. This creates an outcome in which rents are inefficiently distorted towards employees (vice versa for $\\delta_{i t}^{L}<0)$ . Similar to Dobbelaere & Mairesse (2013), I interpret $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ as an inverse measure of firms labor market power, i.e. negative (positive) values of $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ signal labor market power of the firm (firm's workforce).  \n\nAn important precondition for the existence of labor market power is the presence of adjustment frictions that firms and employees utilize to their advantage (e.g. Manning (2003); Naidu, et al. (2018)). On monopsonistic labor markets, firms exploit workerside adjustment costs like moving costs or other local preferences to pay wages below marginal revenue products of labor. On the other hand, worker-side labor market power can only exist if firms cannot freely adjust wages and employment. The latter is a silent feature that underlies all existing bargaining models discussed in the labor market literature. For instance, in the classical efficient bargaining model, firms are restricted to hire workers from an organized union that coordinates its labor supply. This absence of a competitive pool of workers constitutes a hiring friction and causes wages to be higher than workers’ marginal revenue products (McDonald & Solow (1981)). Similarly, any form of institutional employment protection constitutes an adjustment friction from the firm's perspective as well (e.g. contract durations, notice periods for dismissals, etc.). Intuitively, such employiment protection laws (or firm-level agreements) give workers labor market power because they may protect unprofitable workers from being dismissed. To give some more intuition on the interpretation of $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ as a labor market power parameter, the online Appendix B.2 presents two formal labor market models showing how wedges between wages and marginal revenue products of labor translate into labor market power.  \n\nIt remains an issue, however, that $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ could capture adjustment frictions unrelated to labor market power. An example for such an adjustment friction could be the time span of posting a job offer after an unexpected shock. As $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ is derived as a residuum, I cannot completely exclude such adjustment costs as a potential source of my labor market power parameter. In my empirical analysis I will show, however, that firms with $(\\delta_{i t}^{L}<0)$ and without $(\\delta_{i t}^{L}>0)$ labor market power differ in their reactions to (lagged) trade exposure. As I note in section 4.3, this suggests that such technical adjustment barriers faced by all firms equally are unlikely to have a significant role in driving my estimated firm responses to trade. Besides that, I also correlate $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ withobserved characteristics that can be related to labor market power in section 4.1. There I find evidence supporting that $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ (mostly) captures labor market power.  \n\nWhereas $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ reflects the distribution of market power rents between firms and employees, absolute values of $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ measure firms’ contribution to the total extent of labor X market inefficiencies (compared to a neo-classical benchmark scenario with perfect labor markets). This is because perfect labor markets would eliminate every positive and negative gap between wages and MRPL. Petrin & Sivadasan (2013) illustrate this within an accounting framework showing that larger levels of absolute gaps between wages and MRPL signal a larger potential for output increasing reallocation and thus imply a larger gap between realized and potential output. Defining levels of $\\left|\\delta_{i t}^{L}\\right|$ as a measure of firms’ contribution to total labor market inefficiencies therefore follows Petrin & Sivadasan (2013).° Note, however, that this also links into the above definition of labor market power: Intuitively, firms with labor market power demand too few workers, whereas workers with labor market power prevent firms from shrinking. From an efficiency perspective, labor market power creates distortions where too much (little) labor is allocated to firms with $\\delta_{i t}^{L}>0(\\delta_{i t}^{L}<0)$  \n\nBefore using equation (5), I first need to recover $\\theta_{i t}^{L}$ and $\\theta_{i t}^{M}$ by estimating  a production function. As firm-level prices are regularly unobserved, researchers are often forced to assume that input and output prices equalize between firms within industries when estimating the production function. This is hardly compatible with allowing for firm-specific labor market power. As I observe firm-product-level prices, I can account for firm-specific price variation. As shown in the online Appendix D, ignoring firm price variation increases levels of $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ in my case, leading to a higher share of firms and industries in which employees possess labor market power.  \n\n### 3.3 Production function estimation  \n\nI use a translog specification to define firms’ production function because it allows for time-varying and firm-specific output elasticities. For estimation, I define $M_{i t},K_{i t}$ $L_{i t}$ ,and $Q_{i t}$ as a firm's intermediate inputs, capital stock, FTE, and total output, respectively.7 The production function is given by:  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\phi_{i t}^{\\prime}\\beta+\\omega_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nLower-case letters indicate logs. $\\phi_{i t}$ is a vector capturing production inputs and their interactions, $\\pmb{\\beta}$ is the associated vector of coefficients, and $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ is an i.i.d. error term. Hicks-neutral productivity, $\\omega_{i t}$ , follows a Markov process that can be influenced by firm actions and is unobserved to the econometrician. The firm knows $\\omega_{i t}$ before choosing its consumption of intermediate inputs. The innovation in productivity is, however, uncorrelated with the input decision for capital and labor.? Due to the dependence of firms′ intermediate inputs on $\\omega_{i t}$ , estimation of equation (6) by OLS is inconsistent. Besides this simultaneity problem, firm-specific prices are usually unobserved. Hence, if input prices are correlated with input choices, estimating (6) without controlling for firm price variation produces biased input coefficients.  \n\n#### 3.3.1 Unobserved output and input prices  \n\nDue to differences in measurement units, I cannot aggregate output quantities (and prices) for multi-product firms. Therefore, I construct firm-specific output price indices from firm-product-level  price  information  following  the procedure  of  Eslava, Haltiwanger, Kugler, & Kugler (2004), which I describe in the online Appendix I. I purge observed firm revenue (for all firms) from output price variation by deflating it with this price index. With slightly abusing notation, I keep using $q_{i t}$ for the resulting quasi-quantities. To control for unobserved input price variation, I follow Berry (1994) and DLGKP who have shown that market shares and product dummies approximate product quality in a variety of demand models. Consequently, by assuming that producing high quality goods requires high quality inputs, one can use a quality control function based on output price information to absorb input price variation:  \n\n$$\nB_{i t}(.)\\equiv B_{i t}\\big((\\pi_{i t},{\\pmb m}{\\pmb s}_{i t},G_{i t},D_{i t})\\times{\\pmb\\phi}_{i t}^{c};{\\pmb\\beta}\\big).\n$$  \n\n$\\pmb{m}\\pmb{s}_{i t}$ captures domestic quantity and revenue market shares, $\\pi_{i t}$ is the firm-level price index and $G_{i t}$ and $D_{i t}$ contain dummies for headquarter location and four-digit industry affiation. $\\pmb{\\phi}_{i t}^{c}=\\left\\{1;\\widetilde{\\pmb{\\phi}}_{i t}\\right\\}$ contains two vectors. $\\widetilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ includes the same production input terms as $\\phi_{i t}$ , either given in expenditures and deflated by an industrylevel deflator or already reported in quantity terms. The tilde emphasizes that some variables in $\\widetilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ are not expressed in true quantities. The constant highlights that elements of $B(.)$ enter the price control function linearly and interacted with $\\widetilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ (which follows from using a translog production function). This specification captures unobserved input price variation that arises from variation in firms’ input quality, location, and industry affiliation.  \n\nNote that while $M_{i t}$ and $K_{i t}$ enter as deflated expenditures, I use a quantity-based input measure for $L_{i t}$ (FTE). This is strictly preferable to using deflated wage bills because in this case the price control function must only absorb unobserved input price variation in $M_{i t}$ and $K_{i t}$ 1° This is important in my framework, as I allow for labor market power being an additional shifter of wages.  \n\nOriginally, DLGKP estimated product-level production functions when using product prices to control for output and input price variation between firms. I transfer their approach to the firm-level by using revenue weights to aggregate product information. This implicitly assumes that i) such firm aggregates of product quality increase in firm aggregates of product prices and input quality (for inputs entering as deflated expenditures), i) firm-level input costs are increasing in firm-level input quality, and ii) product price elasticities are equal across the various products of a firm. These assumptions, or even stricter versions of them, are always implicitly invoked when estimating firm- instead of product-level production functions.  \n\nFinally, note that the inclusion of a price control function as above would still be preferable to omitting it, even if some of the above assumptions do not hold. This is because including the price control function can still help to absorb some of the unobserved price variation and does not demand that input prices vary between firms with respect to all elements of $B_{i t}(.)$ . The estimation can regularly result in coefficients implying that there is no price variation at all. The attractiveness of a price control function lies in its agnostic view about existence and degree of input price variation.  \n\n#### 3.3.2 Unobserved productivity and identifying moments  \n\nTo address the dependence of firms’ flexible input decision on unobserved productivity, I employ a control function approach in the spirit of Olley & Pakes (1996). I base my control function on firms’ consumption of energy and raw materials, $e_{i t}$ which are components of total intermediate inputs. Inverting the demand function for $e_{i t}$ gives an expression for productivity:  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{i t}\\equiv g_{i t}(.)=g_{i t}(e_{i t},k_{i t},l_{i t},\\mathbf{z}_{i t}),\n$$  \n\nwhere, in addition to $k_{i t}$ and $l_{i t}$ ， $\\mathbf{z}_{i t}$ captures other state variables of the firm. Ideally, $\\mathbf{z}_{i t}$ should include a broad set of variables affecting productivity and demand for $e_{i t}$ Therefore, I include dummy variables for export $(E X_{i t})$ as  well as research and development $(R D_{i t})$ activities, firm-level import competition (as defined in section 2), the number of products a firm produces $(N u m P_{i t})$ ) and the average wage it pays into $\\mathbf{z}_{i t}$ 11 The latter absorbs unobserved quality and price differences that shift demand for $e_{i t}$ , which accounts for the criticism of Gandhi, Navarro, & Rivers (2017) (De Loecker & Scott (2016)).  \n\nI assume that productivity follows a first order Markov process that can be shifted by firm-specific actions: $\\omega_{i t}=h_{i t}(\\omega_{i t-1},T_{i t-1})+\\xi_{i t}=h_{i t}(.)+\\xi_{i t}$ ,where $\\xi_{i t}$ denotes the innovation in productivity and $\\pmb{T_{i t}}=\\left(E X_{i t},R D_{i t},I M P_{i t}^{C H N},N u m P_{i t}\\right)$ reflects that I allow for learning and competition effects from export market participation, import competition, and research activities as well as for (dis)economies of scope to influence firm productivity. Plugging (7), (8) and the law of motion for productivity into (6) gives:  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\widetilde{\\pmb{\\phi}}_{i t}^{\\prime}\\pmb{\\beta}+B_{i t}(.)+h_{i t}(.)+\\varepsilon_{i t}+\\xi_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhich constitutes the basis of my estimation. $^{12}\\mathrm{~I~}$ estimate (9) separately for every two-digit industry by using a one-step estimator in the spirit of Wooldridge (2009). I jointly form identifying moments on $\\varepsilon_{i t}+\\xi_{i t}$  \n\n$$\nE\\big((\\varepsilon_{i t}+\\xi_{i t})\\Upsilon_{i t}\\big)=0,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{Y}}_{i t}$ includes lagged interactions of intermediate inputs with capital and labor, contemporary interactions of capital and labor, lagged elements of $g_{i t}(.)$ ,contemporary location and industry dummies, the lagged output price index, lagged market shares, as well as lagged interactions of the output price index with production inputs. By relying on these moments, I assume that output prices can react to productivity shocks but are correlated over time. Contrary, decisions about location, product mix, and exit and entry into export and research activities are quasi-fixed variables. This allows for the existence of sunk costs when entering export markets, building new plants, or designing new blueprints.  \n\nI report output elasticities derived from the production function estimation in the online Appendix A. Across all industries, median output elasticities for labor, capital, and intermediates respectively equal 0.28, 0.10, and 0.63 (means are similar).  \n\n## 4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS  \n\nThis  chapter presents the empirical results.  Section 4.1  discusses  descriptive evidence on the degree of labor market power distortions within the German manufacturing sector.  Section 4.2 presents the main findings of this article, documenting how final product trade affects labor market power distortions. Section 4.3 continues by analyzing the mechanisms underlying these results.  \n\n### 4.1 Labor market power in the German manufacturing sector  \n\nFrom the estimated output elasticities, I calculate labor market power parameters using equation (5). As a first sanity check, I investigate whether $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ captures relevant dimensions of labor market power by running OLS regressions of the form:  \n\n$$\n\\delta_{i t}^{L}=\\gamma_{0}+c_{i t}^{\\prime}\\gamma+\\upsilon_{j}+\\upsilon_{t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\pmb{c}_{i t}$ is a vector of (mostly) firm-specific variables of interest and $\\upsilon_{j}$ and $\\upsilon_{t}$ capture industry and time fixed effects.  \n\nTable 1 presents the several specifications I estimated. Sample sizes differ due to data availability and I do not claim any causality here. In the first column, I include firms′ FTE, average wages, and capital over labor ratios (all in logs) into the regression model. I find that higher levels of firm labor market power ( $(\\delta_{i t}^{L}<0)$ are associated with a larger firm size, lower wages, and a higher capital intensity. This is already reassuring. Intuitively, firms possessing labor market power should be able to depress wages for a given firm size. The negative coefficient on the capital over labor ratio indicates that firms being less dependent on labor inputs possess more labor market power over their workforce. Column 2 replaces average wages with the value-added labor share and finds that firms with higher labor market power levels are also characterized by smaller labor shares.  \n\nTABLE 1   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"8\">LABORMARKETPOWERPARAMETER</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">ANDOBSERVEDCHARACTERISTICSRELATEDTOLABORMARKETPOWER</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td></tr><tr><td>Employment(FTE)</td><td>-10,834*** (141.70) 23.301***</td><td>-8,999*** (147.10)</td><td>-8,992*** (147.00)</td><td>-9.263*** (146.90)</td><td>-9.753*** (260.20)</td><td></td><td>-9.345*** (549.10)</td></tr><tr><td>Average wages</td><td>(362.80) -4,503***</td><td>-1,807***</td><td>-1,813*** (126.10)</td><td>-1.628***</td><td>-2.052*** (220.80)</td><td></td><td>-3.534***</td></tr><tr><td>Capitaloverlabor Labor share</td><td>(115.30)</td><td>(126.00) 5.131*** (344.80)</td><td>5,138*** (344.8)</td><td>(123.10) 4.864*** (338.10)</td><td>3.507*** (671.90)</td><td></td><td>(709.10) 6,738*** (2,352)</td></tr><tr><td>Labor market</td><td></td><td></td><td>-337.00** (151.20)</td><td>-274.90* (147.80)</td><td>72.62 (320.10)</td><td></td><td>-1,138</td></tr><tr><td>concentration West-Germany</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>7,658***</td><td>7,255***</td><td></td><td>(815.10) 5,615***</td></tr><tr><td>(dummy)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(255.60)</td><td>(389.50) -486.60***</td><td></td><td>(1,273) -625.60*</td></tr><tr><td>Outsourcing rate</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(118.40)</td><td></td><td>(363.60)</td></tr><tr><td>Worker share coveredbyindustry-</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3,089* (1,614)</td><td>-1,511</td></tr><tr><td>widewagestandards</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(1,790)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Time FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>146.209</td><td>146.133</td><td>146.133</td><td>146.133</td><td>84,510</td><td>3,025</td><td>2,184</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.470</td><td>0.367</td><td>0.367</td><td>0.390</td><td>0.406</td><td>0.135</td><td>0.469</td></tr><tr><td>Number of firms</td><td>31,930</td><td>31,916</td><td>31,916</td><td>31,916</td><td>21,282</td><td>2,716</td><td>1,931</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table 1 reports results from estimating equation (11) by OLS using different control variables. The dependent variables in columns 1-7 is the labor market power parameter. All regressions include time and industry fixed effects and are weighted using population weights. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level. The top and bottom one percent of observations with respect to the distribution of the labor market power parameter are excluded.Significance: $^{*10}$ percent, $**5$ percent, $^{***1}$ percent.  \n\nColumn 3 adds a local labor market concentration measure, defined as the log of the sum of firms’ squared employment shares in a given region (i.e. the HHI at the regional level), where I use the 300 German Landkreise as regional unit. The literature documents a positive relationship between local concentration measures and estimates of labor supply elasticities - an alternative measure of firms’ labor market power (e.g. Azar, Marinescu, & Steinbaum (2019)). I also find that firms’ labor market power is higher in concentrated labor markets. Column 4 adds a dummy for being located in West-Germany. Existing work on German industrial relations shows that WestGermany is characterized by a higher union coverage rate and a higher rate of collective wage agreements (Schnabel & Wagner (2007); Oberfichtner & Schnabel (2019)). This should promote a better bargaining position for workers in West-German firms compared to workers employed in East-German firms. I find that $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ can reliably capture this dimension of labor market power. Note, however, that the statistical significance of the labor market concentration measure declines in column 4. Column 5 includes firm's logged outsourcing rate defined as costs for temporary agency workers over total costs for temporary agency and permanently employed workers into the regression model. As expected, firms with higher outsourcing rates have more labor market power over their workforce.  \n\nFinally, I run two more regressions where I control for the log of the firm's employment share working in plants being covered by collectively bargained minimum wage standards (the bargaining is conducted at the industry-level). This information is only available for a small randomly drawn subset of plants and must therefore be treated with caution (not all plants of a firm are necessarily drawn). Consequently, I do not put too much emphasize on the results in columns 6 and 7. As shown in column (6), firms with more workers covered by collectively bargained wage standards possess less labor market power. The coefficient is, however, only statistically significant at the 10 percent level and becomes insignificant after conditioning on the other variables.  \n\nOverall, results in Table 1 are reassuring and indicate that $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ capturesrelevant dimensions of labor market power. Although this does not entirely rule out that variation in $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ might be partly resulting from factors unrelated to labor market power, my results provide evidence that variation in firms? labor market power is a main driver of variation in $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ . In particular, it seems unlikely that frictions unrelated to labor market power differ that clearly along the firm characteristics displayed in Table 1.  \n\nTABLE 2   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">SAMPLEMEDIANSFORLABORMARKETPOWERDISTORTIONSANDFIRMWAGES,</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">BY SECTOR</td></tr><tr><td>Sector</td><td>(1)</td><td>[8] (2)</td><td>Vit (3)</td><td>一屁 (4)</td><td>Observations (5)</td></tr><tr><td>15 Food products and beverages</td><td>12,478.74</td><td>12,494.25</td><td>24,438.17</td><td>0.50</td><td>17,952</td></tr><tr><td>17 Textiles</td><td>11.18</td><td>8,851.34</td><td>31,649.82</td><td>0.00</td><td>5,776</td></tr><tr><td>18 Apparel, dressing, and dyeing of fur</td><td>4,764.42</td><td>8,821.64</td><td>29,988.74</td><td>0.19</td><td>1,766</td></tr><tr><td>19 Leather and leather products</td><td>8,864.06</td><td>9,793.86</td><td>26,980.73</td><td>0.37</td><td>985</td></tr><tr><td>20 Wood and wood products</td><td>1,340.86</td><td>6,620.14</td><td>31,518.65</td><td>0.04</td><td>4,738</td></tr><tr><td>21 Pulp, paper, and paper products</td><td>-6,820.93</td><td>12,525.87</td><td>38,609.97</td><td>-0.20</td><td>4,107</td></tr><tr><td>22 Publishing and printing</td><td>-8,117.07</td><td>22,099.81</td><td>37,544.19</td><td>-0.17</td><td>1,457</td></tr><tr><td>24 Chemicals and chemical products</td><td>-1,907.02</td><td>11,392.41</td><td>46,002.31</td><td>-0.05</td><td>11,481</td></tr><tr><td>25 Rubber and plastic products</td><td>5,667.30</td><td>6,890.19</td><td>34,613.06</td><td>0.18</td><td>11,205</td></tr><tr><td>26 Other non-metallic mineral products</td><td>-f2,790.46</td><td>9,657.55</td><td>36,854.24</td><td>-0.09</td><td>8,952</td></tr><tr><td>27 Basic metals</td><td>-3,900.85</td><td>12,394.92</td><td>40,964.20</td><td>-0.10</td><td>5,900</td></tr><tr><td>28Fabricatedmetalproducts</td><td>5,395.26</td><td>11,042.79</td><td>36,121.34</td><td>0.18</td><td>23,658</td></tr><tr><td>29 Machinery and equipment</td><td>1,718.68</td><td>12,603.35</td><td>42,266.89</td><td>0.05</td><td>27,796</td></tr><tr><td>30 Electrical and optical equipment</td><td>-140.97</td><td>17,395.81</td><td>41,148.26</td><td>0.00</td><td>804</td></tr><tr><td>31 Electrical machinery and apparatus</td><td>1,324.07</td><td>12,755.07</td><td>37,307.54</td><td>0.04</td><td>10,106</td></tr><tr><td>32 Radio,television,and communication</td><td>3,856.67</td><td>16,173.84</td><td>35,583.26</td><td>0.14</td><td>2,385</td></tr><tr><td>33Medical and precisioninstruments</td><td>13,723.91</td><td>16,962.16</td><td>38,148.14</td><td>0.47</td><td>7,480</td></tr><tr><td>34 Motor vehicles and trailers</td><td>-996.72</td><td>20,240.15</td><td>37,439.54</td><td>-0.03</td><td>5,394</td></tr><tr><td>35 Transport equipment</td><td>6,247.36</td><td>17,066.75</td><td>38,471.99</td><td>0.19</td><td>2,007</td></tr><tr><td>36Furniture manufacturing</td><td>6,398.20</td><td>7,698.22</td><td>30,342.60</td><td>0.24</td><td>5,724</td></tr><tr><td>Across all industries</td><td>4,367.01</td><td>11,442.93</td><td>36,519.27</td><td>0.14</td><td>159,673</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table 2 reports sample medians of labor market power distortions for every NACE rev. 1.1 2-digit industry. Column 1-4 respectively report medians for the labor market power parameter, its absolute value, average yearly wages, and differences between De Loecker-Warzynski (2012) markups based on firms' intermediate and labor input decision. Column 5 reports the number of observations used to calculate the respective variables. The top and bottom one percent of observations with respect to the distribution of the labor market power parameter are excluded.  \n\nTable  2  documents  industry-specific  median  values  for $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ , its absolute value, average yearly wages per FTE, and the difference between markup expressions calculated  from  firms’  intermediate $(\\mu_{i t}^{M})$ andlabor $(\\mu_{i t}^{L})$ input decision using the approach of De Loecker & Warzynski (2012).13 The latter difference is included as it is a frequently used measure of labor market power in the literature that implies the value of $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ (see Dobbelaere & Mairesse (2013) and subsequent work). Throughout this study, I express monetary variables in euros of 2000. Across all industries, the median firm pays a wage that, given its employment decision, is 4,400 euros above the output contribution of its employees (column 1). Relating this figure to observed wages, one finds that median labor market power distortions equal to $\\frac{4,367*100}{36,519}\\approx12\\%$ of paid wages. Across industries, labor market power levels vary enormously. Intuitively, one would expect that industries characterized by high wages and which manufacture technologically sophisticated products feature a strong workforce. Whereas this intuition holds for several industries (e.g. medical and precision instruments), high valuesof $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ are not always associated with high wages (e.g. food products and beverages). This ilustrates how employee-side labor market power can also emerge from a low output contribution given paid wages. In that case, employees? labor market power could result from adjustment barriers protecting unproductive workers from being dismissed (e.g. long-term contracts). Column 2 shows absolute values of $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ which reflect the total extent of labor market inefficiencies. Whereas the publishing and printing industry displays the largest absolute distortions, the wood and wood products industry is characterized by the smallest level of labor market inefficiencies. However, even there, median distorted rents equal to 6,600 euros per full-time worker.  \n\nIn some industries, the implied distortions are equivalent to $30{\\cdot}50\\%$ of overall wages. A substantial number that is concealed in existing measures based on subtracting $\\mu_{i t}^{M}$ and $\\mu_{i t}^{L}$ from each other. Notably, the differences between $\\mu_{i t}^{M}$ and $\\mu_{i t}^{L}$ that I estimate are smaller than documented in the literature.14 Consequently, the monetary labor market power distortions reported in Table 2 are small compared to existing estimates. An interesting insight from Table 2 is that judging from the pure magnitude of the estimated wage gaps, models featuring a bargaining over wages subsequent to a perfectly flexible labor quantity decision of the firm cannot explain these massive distortions.  \n\nTABLE 3   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\">SAMPLEPERCENTAGEOFFIRMSWITH POSITIVEANDNEGATIVELABORMARKETPOWERPARAMETERS,BYSECTOR</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of firm- year observations with > 0 (PD-firms)</td><td>Percentage of firm-year observations with 8< 0 (ND-firms)</td><td>Number of firm-year observations</td></tr><tr><td>Sector 15 Food products and beverages</td><td>(1) (2) 96.37 3.63 50.12</td><td>(3) 18,432</td></tr><tr><td>17 Textiles</td><td>49.88 69.16</td><td>5,782 1,767</td></tr><tr><td>18 Apparel, dressing, and dyeing of fur</td><td>30.84</td><td>985</td></tr><tr><td>19 Leather and leather products</td><td>80.91 19.09</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>20 Wood and wood products</td><td>55.48 44.52</td><td>4,755</td></tr><tr><td>21 Pulp, paper, and paper products</td><td>33.60 66.40</td><td>4,217</td></tr><tr><td>22 Publishing and printing</td><td>39.11 60.89</td><td>1,667</td></tr><tr><td>24 Chemicals and chemical products</td><td>45.53 54.47</td><td>11,575</td></tr><tr><td>25 Rubber and plastic products</td><td>76.83 23.17</td><td>11,274</td></tr><tr><td>26 Other non-metallic mineral products</td><td>42.46 57.54</td><td>8,968</td></tr><tr><td>27 Basic metals</td><td>41.16 58.84</td><td>5,965</td></tr><tr><td>28 Fabricated metal products</td><td>64.85 35.15</td><td>23,795</td></tr><tr><td>29 Machinery and equipment</td><td>53.59 46.41</td><td>28,209</td></tr><tr><td>30Electrical and opticalequipment</td><td>47.52 52.48</td><td>909</td></tr><tr><td>31 Electrical machinery and apparatus</td><td>52.81 47.19</td><td>10,242</td></tr><tr><td>32Radio,television,and communication</td><td>55.67 44.33</td><td>2,680</td></tr><tr><td>33Medical andprecisioninstruments</td><td>78.40 21.60</td><td>7,745</td></tr><tr><td>34 Motor vehicles and trailers</td><td>44.37 55.63</td><td>6,094</td></tr><tr><td>35 Transport equipment</td><td>58.41 41.59</td><td>2,104</td></tr><tr><td>36 Furniture manufacturing</td><td>76.85 23.15</td><td>5,766</td></tr><tr><td>Across all industries</td><td>61.31 38.69</td><td>162,931</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table 3 reports sample percentages PD-firms and ND-firms for every NACE rev. 1.1 two-digit industry. Columns 1-2 respectively report the sample percentages of PD-firms and ND-firms for each two-digit industry. Column 3 reports the associated number of sample observations per industry.  \n\nIn my empirical exercise I run separate regressions for firms with $(\\delta_{i t}^{L}<0)$ and without $(\\delta_{i t}^{L}>0)$ labor market power, as the prevalence of labor market power might determine the pass-through of firm profit gains and losses to wage and employment adjustments. Table 3 shows the sample percentages of firms characterized by $\\delta_{i t}^{L}>0$ and $\\delta_{i t}^{L}<0$ , which I respectively denote as positively distorted (PD) and negatively distorted (ND) firms. Thirteen out of twenty industries host a majority of PD-firms, whereas the other seven are dominated by ND-firms. In total, I classify 61.3 (38.7) percent of my firm-year observations as PD-firms (ND-firms).15 Notably, within firms, the classification into PD- and ND-firms is stable across time. Only $7.7\\%$ Of all observations switch between both categories. In the online Appendix J, I run several regressions to show how PD- and ND-firms differ in their characteristics. The results are consistent with the estimates in Table 1. On average, PD-firms pay higher wages, are smaller, both in terms of labor force and produced output, have higher product market power and lower labor shares, display a lower labor productivity, and have lower capital to labor ratios.  \n\n### 4.2 Chinese trade exposure and labor market power distortions  \n\nTo infer on the effects of Chinese trade exposure on labor market power distortions, I consider the following specification:  \n\n$$\ny_{i t}=\\gamma_{I M P}I M P_{i t-1}^{C H N}+\\gamma_{E X P}E X P_{i t-1}^{C H N}+C_{i t-1}^{\\prime}\\gamma+\\upsilon_{i j}+\\upsilon_{t}.\n$$  \n\nEXPiHNMgmd MPCHn measuefm-level oxport oporuies to and import competition from China. Consistent with the production model described in section 3, 1 rely on lagged trade measures to allow for a timeframe in which adjustment processes can be realized. The vector $c$ introduces control variables. $\\upsilon_{t}$ and $\\upsilon_{i j}$ capture time and firm-industry fixed effects, whereas $y_{i t}=\\{\\delta_{i t}^{L},|\\delta_{i t}^{L}|\\}$ .1° Estimating the model in levels while controlling for firm-industry and year fixed effects uses the same identifying variation as a first difference model but avoids a disproportional loss of observations when working with an unbalanced panel (as I do).  \n\n#### 4.2.1 Baseline results  \n\nTable 4 displays results from estimating equation (12). OLS regressions (columns 1- 4) imply that exposure to import competition decreases firms? labor market power $(\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ rises). Simultaneously, they show an increase in labor market efficiency from import competition $(\\left|\\delta_{i t}^{L}\\right|$ falls). According to OLS, export opportunities do not affect labor market power distortions.  \n\nTABLE 4   \nLABOR MARKET DISTORTIONS AND CHINESE TRADE EXPOSURE   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">OLS</td><td colspan=\"4\">IV</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">ott</td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">[8t]</td><td>[8]</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td><td>(8)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>96.68***</td><td>-38.24**</td><td>83.87***</td><td>-40.36** (18.42)</td><td>220.20***</td><td>-40.32</td><td>187.40***</td><td>-45.69</td></tr><tr><td>EXPCHN</td><td>(26.19) -19.81</td><td>(18.57) 30.74</td><td>(23.74) -31.74</td><td>28.77</td><td>(61.92) -428.00***</td><td>(43.89) 278.20***</td><td>(54.09) -391.90***</td><td>(44.35) 284.20***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(23.70)</td><td>(20.94)</td><td>(22.31) 21,564***</td><td>(20.94) 3,559***</td><td>(130.50)</td><td>(100.90)</td><td>(116.30) 21,580***</td><td>(101.00) 3,538***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(714.80)</td><td>(644.00)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(715.90)</td><td>(644.40)</td></tr><tr><td>Firm-industry FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Time FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Firm-level controls</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>108,776</td><td>108,776</td><td>108,776</td><td>108,776</td><td>108,776</td><td>108,776</td><td>108,776</td><td>108,776</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.921</td><td>0.864</td><td>0.930</td><td>0.865</td><td>0.920</td><td>0.864</td><td>0.930</td><td>0.864</td></tr><tr><td>First-stage F-test</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>108.3</td><td>108.3</td><td>108.4</td><td>108.4</td></tr><tr><td>Number of firms</td><td>24,304</td><td>24,304</td><td>24,304</td><td>24,304</td><td>24,304</td><td>24,304</td><td>24,304</td><td>24,304</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes: Table 4 reports results from estimating equation (12) by OLS and IV using the full sample of firms. OLS results are reported in columns 1-4. IV results are reported in columns 5-8. The dependent variable in columns 1, 3, 5, and 7 is the labor market power parameter, $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ , whereas in columns 2, 4, 6, and 8 it is the absolute value of the labor market power parameter, $\\lvert\\delta_{i t}^{L}\\rvert$ .All regressions include time and firm-industry fixed effects and controls for firms’ size, worker outsourcing rate, share of researchers in the workforce, market share, and labor productivity. All regressions are weighted using population weights. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level. The top and bottom one percent of observations with respect to the distribution of the labor market  \n\npower parameter are excluded. Significance: $^{*}10$ percent, $**5$ percent, $^{***1}$ percent.  \n\nFor identifying the effects of international trade on labor market distortions, it is important that the competitiveness of intermediate inputs markets does not itself react to trade exposure. I account for this concern by controlling for contemporaneous values of $\\mu_{i t}^{M}=\\theta_{i t}^{M}*\\frac{P_{i t}Q_{i t}}{V_{i t}^{M}M_{i t}}$ As $\\mu_{i t}^{M}$ cauesafiam controlling for it isolates responses of $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ and $\\left|\\delta_{i t}^{L}\\right|$ from reactions of firms’ market power in intermediate input markets and thus ensures that the estimated effects are not caused by changes in the competitive benchmark (see also the online Appendix C.1). Controlling for $\\mu_{i t}^{M}$ , however, also absorbs the part of the effect from international trade on $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ which works through changes in firms? product market power. As such changes could itself influence rent sharing processes (Nickell (1999)), I focus my interpretations on specifications excluding $\\mu_{i t}^{M}$ and consider regressions including $\\mu_{i t}^{M}$ as robustness checks. Yet, controlling for $\\mu_{i t}^{M}$ leaves the results unchanged.  \n\nAs OLS regressions might suffer from an endogeneity bias, we cannot draw causal inference from them. The main concern is that unobserved product demand and supply shocks simultaneously affect trade flows and domestic firms’ labor demand. To address this identification problem, I apply an IV approach using trade flows between China and countries similar to Germany as instruments for IMPCHN and EXPCHN. . I define instruments in the following way: For every product, I calculate the share of imports (exports） flowing from China (instrument group countries) to instrument group countries (China) in total imports (exports) flowing from the world (instrument group countries) to the instrument group countries (world).17 Identical to the construction of  \n\n$I M P_{i t}^{C H N}$ and $E X P_{i t}^{C H N}$ I agregae thse podut-level rade lows to the fim level by using product revenue shares in firms? total product market revenue.  \n\nUsing trade flows to other countries as instruments for local trade flows exploits that China's rise induces demand and supply shocks also for other trade partners. When defining instruments, I only use countries that are neither direct neighbors of Germany nor share the same currency. This minimizes concerns about correlated unobserved demand and supply shocks between Germany and countries included in the instrument group that would invalidate my identification (Dauth et al. (2014).18 The online Appendix G reports the first stage regressions for the following main IV results.  \n\nUsing IV estimators increases the magnitude of my coefficients.19 According to column 5, a unit increase in import competition raises the share of rents that every fulltime worker captures from its firm relative to its output contribution by 220 euros, whereas a unit increase in export opportunities decreases this share by 428 euros. To put this into perspective: Using weights, I calculate that throughout my observation period Chinese import competition and export demand increased by 0.8 and 1.0 points, respectively. Furthermore, I calculate that each year roughly 5 million full-time workers are active in German manufacturing sector firms with at least 20 employees. Hence, the estimates in column 5 suggest that the increase in export demand (import competition)  \n\nfrom China raised rents that firms (workers) can capture, relative to their employees (firms) by 2.14 billion (880 million) euros.  \n\nThe increaseof $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ from import competition is not associated with a statistically significant effect on labor market efficiency, whereas a rise in export demand decreases labor market efficiency (column 6).2o  \n\n#### 4.2.2 PD- vs. ND-firms  \n\nAt first glance, my results seem counterintuitive. One could expect that a rise in import competition would decrease $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ by lowering employees? bargaining power due to a replacement of domestic production by foreign firms (Rodrik (1997). Reversely, one could expect an increase of $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ from new export opportunities. However, there is a simple mechanism working against this logic: Final product trade may increase or decrease firms’ profits stronger than their labor expenditures. Intuitively, the degree of pass-through of profit changes to workforce adjustment may be determined by existing labor market power structures that prevent smooth workforce adjustments.21  \n\nTo shed light on that, I investigate whether firms with (ND-firms) and without (PDfirms) labor market power respond heterogeneously to final product trade. ND-firms could exploit their labor market power to prevent export market profit gains from being shared with their workforce, decreasing $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ for these firms. Oppositely, employees with positive labor market power might prevent output losses from import competition from being transferred to them.  \n\nTable 5 runs the regressions from Table 4 again on firms grouped according to their t - 1 regime-type. Within PD-firms, a one unit increase in import competition increases the share of rents that workers can gain relative to their firm by 136 euros (column 5). For ND-firms, this coefficient is larger (230 euros). Consistent with these findings, labor market efficiency decreases (increases) from import competition targeted at PDfirms (ND-firms). For ND-firms, controlling for $\\mu_{i t}^{M}$ reduces the significance of these results to the 10-percent level (column 7 and 8).  \n\nConcerning the effects of foreign demand, I find that a unit increase in export opportunities increases firms? rents, relative to their workers, by 637 euros (column 5). This translates into a huge loss in labor market efficiency that amounts to 5 percent of the median (absolute) labor market distortion across all industries (Table 2). Interestingly, there is no effect of export opportunities on labor market power within PD-firms. Thus, an increase in foreign demand tends to raise inequality in labor market power between workers employed in PD- and ND-firms. I investigate this further in the online Appendix E and indeed find a positive causal relationship between industry-level dispersion in $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ and industry-level export opportunities. Again, IV-estimates are much larger in terms of magnitude than OLS-estimates in Table 5 (see footnote 19 above).  \n\nTable 5 confirms that existing labor market power structures are relevant for determining how international trade influences labor market distortions. As export opportunities (import competition) might increase existing labor market distortions if firms (employees) possess labor market power, trade can widen gaps between potential and realized output. Import competition can, however, exert a disciplining effect by decreasing ND-firms’ labor market power. Consequently, it depends on existing domestic labor market power structures whether final product trade can improve or worsen labor market efficiency. This constitutes a novel margin for gains (losses) from trade. Although I cannot quantify such additional gains and losses in my analysis, my findings highlight that models abstracting from such interdependencies might misjudge distributional outcomes and welfare gains from trade and, more generally, from product market competition and demand shocks.  \n\nTABLE 5   \nLABOR MARKET DISTORTIONS AND CHINESE TRADE EXPOSURE,   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"9\">PD-FIRMS VS.

Table 5 reports results from estimating equation (12) by OLS and IV using separate samples for t - 1 PD-firms (Panel A) and ND-firms (Panel B). OLS results are reported in columns 1-4. IV results are reported in columns 5-8. The dependent variable in columns 1, 3, 5, and 7 is the labor market power parameter, $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ , whereas in columns 2, 4, 6, and 8 it is the absolute value of the  \n\nlabor market power parameter, $\\overline{{|\\delta_{i t}^{L}|}}$ . All regressions include time and firm-industry fixed effects and controls for firms? size, worker outsourcing rate, share of researchers in the workforce, market share, and labor productivity. Regressions are weighted using population weights. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level. The top and bottom one percent of observations with respect to the distribution of the labor market power parameter are excluded. Significance: $^{*}10$ percent, $**5$ percent, $^{***1}$ percent.  \n\nI present several robustness checks in the online Appendix F. First, I use the BRICS country group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) instead of China as Germany's trade partner. This generalizes my analysis to a broader set of countries and addresses concerns about measurement errors in my trade measures for products that do not have China as their main import origin or export destination. Second, to address concerns about splitting firms into PD- and ND-samples based on a time-varying lagged outcome variable, I run three additional sets of regressions where I i) control for a dummy being one if firms switched their classification into PD- and ND-firms between $t$ and $t-1$ , i) exclude firms that changed their classification into PD- and ND-firms at some point in time, and i) split my firm sample on the basis of time-invariant regional measures of labor market power. Third, I re-run my entire estimation procedure without correcting for unobserved firm price variation showing that the effects of final product trade on labor market power do not depend on the complicated estimation approach described in section 33. Fourth, I address concerns of endogeneity with respect to my instruments by constructing new instruments that exclusively rely on firms’ first observed product portfolio when aggregating product-level trade flows to the firm level (i.e. I use fixed weights for agregation). While I find that the labor market disciplining effect of import competition on ND-firms is sensitive to the choice of the empirical specification, most of my other results are extremely robust to these different specifications.  \n\n### 4.3 Firm adjustments to Chinese trade exposure  \n\nWedges between workers’ output contribution and wages change in response to increasing trade exposure, if labor expenditure adjustments do not concord with changes in profits. This creates room for labor market disciplining and distorting effects from trade. My findings suggest a domination of the latter in the case of Germany. Interestingly, incomplete adjustment processes on labor markets bear a close analogy to recent findings on an incomplete pass-through of trade related cost savings and exchange rate shocks to consumer prices (e.g. Amiti, Itskhoki, & Konings (2014); DLGKP). Recent work highlights such incomplete pass-through processes in output markets as a source of distorting effects from international trade (e.g. Weinberger (2017); Arkolakis et al. (2018)). Similar to this literature on product market distortions, an incomplete pass-through of firm profit changes to labor input adjustments could introduce distortions on labor markets, explaining the previous section's results.  \n\nTo investigate this further, Table 6 reports IV regression results for the responses of firms² revenue deflated by an industry-level deflator $(r_{i t})$ ,FTE $(l_{i t})$ ,averagewages $(v_{i t}^{L})$ , and ratio of intermediate to labor input expenditures $(\\chi_{i t})-\\mathrm{all}$ in logs - to trade exposure. Results are separately reported for PD- (Panel A) and ND-firms (Panel B).  \n\nTable 6 suggests that trade related profit changes do not perfectly translate into labor adjustments. Note, however, that the mechanism behind the effect of import competition on ND-firms cannot be identified. This is unsurprising as the associated responseof $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ within ND-firms is imprecisely estimated and sensitive to the empirical specification. In contrast, I find a clear negative effect of import competition on revenues and employment for PD-firms. Yet, PD-firms decrease intermediate input expenditures stronger than labor expenditures in response to import competition (column 4). This creates a wedge between the adjustments of flexible commodities and labor inputs and (holding technology constant) implies that, although employees in PDfirms suffer from adverse competition shocks, PD-firms cannot completely pass the revenue losses from import competition through to workforce adjustments. As consequence, $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ increases for these firms. Hence, labor market power on the employee side protects workers from adverse shocks, which creates labor market inefficiencies (i.e. PD-firms cannot shrink sufficiently). Yet, whether the inability of PD-firms to adjust their labor input downwards emerges from fixed contract durations, important firm specific worker skills, or other frictions cannot be differentiated in my empirical analysis.  \n\nTable 6  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">FIRM ADJUSTMENTS AND CHINESE TRADE EXPOSURE, PD-FIRMSVS.ND-FIRMS</td></tr><tr><td>Panel A: PD-firms</td><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>rit (1)</td><td>lit (2)</td><td>vit (3)</td><td>Xit (4)</td></tr><tr><td>IMPCHN it-1</td><td>-0.0104*** (0.00250)</td><td>-0.00813*** (0.00206)</td><td>-0.000650 (0.000854)</td><td>-0.00557*** (0.00194)</td></tr><tr><td>EXPCHN it-1</td><td>0.0258*** (0.00627)</td><td>0.00899** (0.00438)</td><td>0.00969*** (0.00237)</td><td>0.00611 (0.00463)</td></tr><tr><td>Firm * Industry FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Time FE Observations</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES 63,183</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>63,183 0.982</td><td>63,183 0.981</td><td>63,183 0.939</td><td>0.940</td></tr><tr><td>First-stage F-test</td><td>71.73</td><td>71.73</td><td>71.73</td><td>71.73</td></tr><tr><td>Number of firms</td><td>16,481</td><td>16,481</td><td>16,481</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>16,481</td></tr><tr><td>Panel B: ND-firms</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>ND-firms</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>rit</td><td>lit</td><td>vit</td><td>Xit</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>IMPCHN it-1</td><td>0.00383</td><td>0.00190</td><td>0.00106</td><td>-0.00313</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.00430)</td><td>(0.00319)</td><td>(0.00212)</td><td>(0.00361)</td></tr><tr><td>EXPCHN</td><td>0.0212***</td><td>0.00240</td><td>0.00237</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Pit-1</td><td>(0.00717)</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0239***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.00576)</td><td>(0.00363)</td><td>(0.00733)</td></tr><tr><td>Firm * Industry FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Time FE</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>41,263</td><td></td><td></td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>41,263</td><td>41,263</td><td>41,263</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.986</td><td>0.986</td><td>0.955</td><td>0.926</td></tr><tr><td>First-stage F-test</td><td>34.44</td><td>34.44</td><td>34.44</td><td>34.44</td></tr><tr><td>Number of firms</td><td>8,717</td><td>8,717</td><td>8,717</td><td>8,717</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table 6 reports results from estimating equation (12) without any control variables by IV using separatesamplesfor $t-1$ PD-firms (Panel A) and ND-firms (Panel B). The dependent variables in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively are logs of firms′ revenue deflated with an industry specific price index, FTE, average wages, and ratio between intermediate and labor input expenditures. All regressions include time and firm-industry fixed effects and are weighted using population weights. Standard errors are  \n\nclustered at the firm level. The top and bottom one percent of observations with respect to the distribution of the labor market power parameter are excluded. Significance: $^{*10}$ percent, $**5$ percent, $^{***1}$ percent.  \n\nWithin PD-firms, new rents from export market participation are passed on to positive workforce adjustments. This explains the insignificant effects from export opportunitieson $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ and $|\\delta_{i t}^{L}|$ within PD-firms. Interestingly, while ND-firms can increase their output in response to an increase in export demand, I find no statistically significant adjustment in their labor expenditures (also the point estimates are low compared to changes in revenue). Yet, ND-firms increase their intermediate input expenditures which causes a wedge between adjustments in flexible commodities and labor input expenditures implying an incomplete pass-through of export profit gains to adjustments in labor expenses. This ND-firm-specific mechanism gives rise to labor market distorting effects from export opportunities (again, compared to a model with perfect labor markets).  \n\nThe results in Table 6 suggest that ND-firms do not share rents from increasing foreign demand  with their workforce and instead try  to substitute labor for intermediates. Firms on monopsonistic labor markets have strong incentives to do so: If labor and intermediates are substitutes, and if firms have labor market power, we expect that firms, in response to rising product demand, increase their demand for inputs bought on competitive input markets relative to labor. This is because increasing the amount of labor becomes increasingly costly for monopsonistic firms, while input prices are exogenously fixed on competitive input markets. Notably, a substitution of workers with intermediates might additionally fortify ND-firms labor market power by lowering the bargaining power of their workers (i.e. ND-firms become less dependent On labor).2  \n\nFinally, note that rising foreign demand leads to an increase in wages and employment within PD-firms, while both variables are unaffected within ND-firms. This  implies  that the  decrease in $\\delta_{i t}^{L}$ and the  associated  decrease  in  labor market efficiency from an increase in export opportunities for ND-firms are unlikely to be caused by institutional barriers or short run adjustment frictions preventing upward wage and employment adjustments.  \n\n## 5. CONCLUSION  \n\nThis article examines how final product trade with China shapes and interacts with labor markets power distortions in the German manufacturing sector by using a simple econometric partial equilibrium approach. I estimate labor market power distortions by calculating monetary wedges between workers’ output contribution and received compensation that prevent the competitive labor market outcome.  \n\nIn studying the impact of final product trade on labor market power in the German manufacturing sector, I find that firms possessing labor market power prevent an optimal pass-through of export profits gains to labor input expenditures. This raises their profit shares relative to their workers? labor shares. On the other hand, firms facing a workforce with positive labor market power cannot fully pass losses from import competition through to efficient wage and employment adjustments. Both effects distort rents towards firms and employees with labor market power and decrease total labor market efficiency. In contrast, evidence for labor market disciplining effects is extremely sensitive to the employed empirical specification.  \n\nThe relevance of existing heterogeneous structures of labor market distortions in shaping distributional and efficiency related outcomes is an aspect that is widely unconsidered in the theoretical literature. Yet, the result that trade related changes in product market competition and demand can fortify prevalent labor market power distortions is of clear importance for designing industrial and trade policy. Although trade may still be welfare increasing, an increase in labor market distortions diminishes total trade gains compared to the first best allocative efficient scenario, which is usually considered in most theoretical models of trade.  \n\nAn important aspect that this article emphasizes is the role of labor market power as an alternative source of firm market power. While most existing IO-studies neglect this dimension of firm market power, incorporating imperfect labor markets into the analysis might offer new insights on currently intensively debated questions concerning firm market power. For instance, the existence of labor market power might be important for understanding how firm market power has changed over the past decades and how potentially rising firm market power has contributed to several macroeconomic trends like falling labor shares, rising inequality, and declining business dynamism. I therefore believe that investigating the determinants and importance of labor market power constitutes a promising field for future research and hope that this article encourages fruitful discussions on this topic.  \n\nREFERENCES   \nACKERBERG, D., & HAHN, J.

In past decades, labour market power increasingly moderated rising between-firm wage inequality. This is because high-paying firms possess high and increasing labour market power and pay wages below competitive levels, whereas low-wage firms pay competitive wages. Over time, large, high-wage, high-productivity firms generate increasingly large labour market rents while selling on competitive product markets. This provides novel insights on why such “superstar firms\" are profitable and successful.

Technological change and globalization are often seen as main contributors to these trends. Yet, recent research started a new debate on the role of monopsonistic corporate market power in explaining this labor market transformation and in affecting economic welfare (e.g. Naidu et al. (2018); Berger et al. (2019); Mertens (2020a); Azar & Vives (2019, 2020); Stansbury & Summers (2020); Manning (2021)).1 This work spurred discussions on benefits of intensifying the regulation of firms’ labor market power, which in the enforcement of most antitrust regulations plays only a tangential role, at least when it comes to the success of actual litigations (Naidu et al. (2018); Marinescu & Hovenkamp (2019). Yet, to assess the desirability of such policies, we need to understand the causes and consequences of labor market power and how labor market power is distributed across firms and employees - a topic to which this article contributes.  \n\nMonopsonistic labor market power reflects in wages being below the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL) and much of the recent industrial organization and economic law literature focuses on this firm-side labor market power while ignoring cases where employees use their labor market power to drive wages above firms? MRPL. Yet, accounting for both, employer- and employee-side labor market power, is crucial for understanding how labor market power affects labor markets because wages also depend on rent-sharing processes between workers and firms.  \n\nAgainst this backdrop, I first derive an efficient bargaining framework allowing for arbitrary firm- and employee-side labor market power.2 I introduce firm-side labor market power into this setting by assuming that only a part of the workforce bargains with firms over rents. Wages of the remaining workforce are determined in a monopsonistic labor market. Combining different first order conditions then recovers a measurable expression for firm- and even firm-worker-group-specific labor market power (the wedge between firms wages and MRPL). Due to duality of firms’ cost minimization and profit maximization, my approach also delivers product markup expressions identical to the framework of De Loecker & Warzynski (2012) and thus conceptually extends their work to include firm- and workerside labor market power.  \n\nAlthough the literature applies similar approaches, existing research either i) invokes a polar labor market structure sorting firms into monopsonistic and efficient bargaining regimes (e.g. Dobbelaere & Mairesse (2013); Dobbelaere et al. (2020) or ii) completely abstracts from either rent-sharing or monopsonistic wage setting power (e.g. Card et al. (2018); Morlacco (2019); Azar et al. (2019)). In contrast, I derive firm- and employee-side labor market power from a single optimization framework that nests existing rent-sharing and monopsonistic labor market models and does not sort firms into specific labor market regimes.  \n\nHaving derived this framework, I apply it to German manufacturing sector firm-level data from 1995 to 2016, covering a time span of strongly rising wage inequality in Germany (Card et al. (2013)), to study how firm-specific labor market power affects firm wage differences. This dataset is well-suited for my analysis as it contains firm-specific price information which is key for estimating production functions and labor market power (De Loecker et al. (2016)).3  \n\nAlthough there  is  an  important  dimension  of  within-firm-between-worker  wage differences for explaining inequality, this article focuses on how firm-specific labor market power relates to between-firm wage dispersion, which has been identified as a key factor (if not the most important factor) in contributing to rising wage inequality.4 As I show, my framework can, however, readily be used to study worker-group-specific labor market power within firms, which I leave for future work. Nevertheless, I prove from these worker-groupspecific labor market power expressions that, even without information on firms’ workforce compositions, one can calculate unbiased measures of firm-level labor market power - the object of interest in this study - from firm-level production and cost data.5  \n\nStrikingly, I find that a counterfactual elimination of all existing labor market power would increase the dispersion of wages between firms. Hence, labor market power contributes to between-firm wage equality. This moderating effect of labor market power on firm wage inequality became increasingly stronger in past decades.  \n\nThe reason for this result is that although large, high-paying, and highly productive firms (recently called “superstar firms\") pay above average wages, they enjoy large labor market power and pay wages below their high MRPL.6 Simultaneously, given market-wide wages, smaller and low-paying firms cannot pay wages below their low MRPL. This compresses the firm wage distribution relative to the firm MRPL distribution, causing the firm labor market power distribution to contribute to between-firm wage equality.  \n\nParticularly at the upper ends of the wage, size, and MRPL distributions, wage-MRPL gaps are large and increasing. This i) results in wages being below competitive levels in these firms, which strongly contributes to between-firm wage equality (as these firms pay already high wages), and i) reflects that firm labor market power is increasingly concentrated in large, high-paying, high-MRPL firms. Whereas these firms’ labor market power is high and growing, their product market power is low. Hence, these firms generate increasingly high labor market rents while selling on competitive product markets, which offers a novel view on why such “superstar firms\"” are profitable and successful.  \n\nDue to exploiting long and detailed firm-product-level panel data, my analysis is limited to the German manufacturing sector. I address this shortcoming using micro-aggregated data covering most economic sectors for ten other European countries to test the external validity of my results. Most of my findings hold across all countries of my additional analysis, implying that the inequality-moderating effect of labor market power due to “superstar firms\"’ enjoying a huge amount of labor market power is not unique to the German manufacturing sector, but an economic feature of many countries and sectors.  \n\nPersistent and rising wage inequality remains to be one of the most intensively debated public policy issues. Recent work increasingly highlights the importance of firm heterogeneity in explaining pay inequality. Song et al. (2019) show that two thirds of the rise in U.S. earnings inequality between 1978 and 2013 are explained by an increase in the dispersion of average wages between firms. Other studies highlighting the importance of between-firm wage dispersion in contributing to wage inequality are Davis & Haltiwanger (1991) for the U.S., Helpman et al. (2017) for Brazil, and Faggio et al. (2010) for the United Kingdom. Similarly, Card et al. (2013) report a substantial contribution of firm wage premia to rising wage inequality in West-Germany between 1985 and 2009.  \n\nIn addition, several studies highlight a link between increasing firm wage differences and rising firm productivity dispersion (Dunne et al. (2004); Barth et al. (2016); Berlingieri et al. (2017). Typically, this link is motivated through rent-sharing models where better firm performance results in higher wages (Card et al. (2018) provide a review). In contrast to classical rent-sharing approaches, I derive labor market power from measurable wedges between firms’ wages and MRPL. This yields a firm-specific measure of monopsonistic and/or worker-side labor market power. Allowing for this type of firm heterogeneity is precisely what uncovers that labor market power counteracts existing firm wage differences. Conceptually, the existing rent-sharing literature cannot provide this insight as it defines rent-sharing elasticities that are equal across firms. My findings therefore call for a serious reevaluation of the long-standing view that labor market power causes firm pay differences. If it would, wages should be (unconditionally) higher in firms where workers enjoy higher labor market power. Yet, the opposite is true. In line with Lamadon et al. (2019) and Bonhomme et al. (2020), my study is therefore supportive of alternative factors causing between-firm  wage  inequality,  like  (unobserved)  worker productivity  differentials, differences in firms? production technologies, and worker-firm sorting.7  \n\nMy study also speaks to the recent literature on rising firm market power and its relation to secular labor market trends (e.g. De Loecker & Eeckhout (2020); De Loecker et al. (2020). More specifically, I address work focusing on (rising) firm labor market power as explanation for these trends. Much of this young literature concentrates on the importance of (rising) firm labor market power for the fall of labor's share (Mertens (2020a); GouinBonenfant (2020); Brooks et al. (2021). I instead study the role of firm- and worker-side labor market power on the widely documented increase in wage inequality. This also contributes to the general debate on how firm market power shaped the economic environment in past decades.\\*  \n\nThe remainder proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 derives my framework to estimate firms? labor market power and MRPL. Section 4 presents results and studies how labor market power affects between-firm wage inequality. Section 5 discusses robustness tests including a replication of my key results for ten other European countries. Section 6 concludes.  \n\n### 2Data  \n\n#### 2.1  Firm-level data on the German manufacturing sector  \n\nMy main analysis is based on an administrative firm-level panel dataset for the German manufacturing sector from 1995 to 2016. This dataset is supplied by the statistical offices of Germany and firms are obliged to report. Among others, the data contain information on firms’ employment, investment, revenue, and, most importantly, product quantities and prices at a detailed ten-digit product classification (Appendix A.1 provides examples of the product classifications). The information on firm-specific prices and output quantities allows me to estimate a quantity-based production model of firms, which is key in estimating firms? labor market power and MRPL (De Loecker et al. (2016)).  \n\nTo limit administrative burden, the statistical offices collect this data only for firms with at least 20 employees.? Moreover, some variables are only collected for a representative and periodically rotating firm sample, covering $40\\%$ of all manufacturing firms with at least 20 employees. The latter includes information on intermediate input expenditures and labor costs by various categories.10 Online Appendix A.1 details all variable definitions used in this article, explains how to access this data, and provides relevant summary statistics. There, I also discuss how I address changes in sector classifications in my data.  \n\n### 2.2 CompNet data  \n\nIn section 5, I asses the external validity of my findings using the CompNet data (8th vintage)  for ten other  European countries. This data contains aggregated firm-level information at the industry (two-digit), sector (one-digit), and country level, including most economic sectors. The data is collected from harmonized data collection protocols that run over administrative firm-level databases of several European national statistical institutes and central banks.  \n\nThe data includes information on various productivity and performance measures of firms and other basic information, like firm wages, employment, capital stocks, and sales. In its $8^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vintage, the CompNet data also includes information on firms’ MRPL and labor market power based on production function estimation techniques. Although this data is aggregated, it collects the distribution of variables within each aggregation level and contains so called joint-distributions” that summarize variables for given percentiles of other variables. As the CompNet data is population weighted, it is highly representative. The data is available with and without a cut-off rule of 20 employees per firm. I focus on the truncated version, as it is available for more countries (results are robust to using non-truncated data).  \n\nA drawback of the CompNet data is its lack of firm-specific price data. Estimates of labor market power and MRPL are thus based on much more assumptions than in my main analysis (see online Appendix C and CompNet (2020)).11 Besides that, the data features a shorter and by country varying time span. Nevertheless, the CompNet data constitutes a valuable source for testing the external validity of my results. Online Appendix A.2 provides more details on the data and on how to access it.  \n\n### 3  Recovering labor market power expressions  \n\nThis section derives my framework to estimate firms’ labor market power and MRPL. Section 3.1 describes the general setting. Section 3.2 derives the theoretical framework and discusses how labor market power effects wages. Section 3.3 explains how to estimate necessary parameters.  \n\n#### 3.1 Preliminaries  \n\nFirm $i$ produces physical output $Q_{i t}$ in period $t$ using the production function:  \n\n$$\nQ_{i t}=Q_{i t}(.)=Q_{i t}(L_{i t},K_{i t},M_{i t},e^{\\omega_{i t}}).\n$$  \n\n$\\omega_{i t}$ is total factor productivity. $L_{i t},K_{i t}$ , and $M_{i t}$ respectively denote labor, capital, and intermediate inputs. The only formal requirement for the production function (1) is that it is twice differentiable. To derive firms? labor (or product) market power, we must observe at least one flexible input for which input prices are given to firms. Following the literature, this is $M_{i t}$ in my case.12 In contrast, labor markets can feature any type of market power imperfection. For convenience, I ignore capital market imperfections as they are irrelevant for my analysis.  \n\nLabor exists in two types, $L_{i t}^{M O}$ and $L_{i t}^{E B}$ , with $L_{i t}^{M O}+L_{i t}^{E B}=L_{i t}$ where $M O$ and $E B$ are reminiscent of the monopsonistic (MO) and efficient bargaining (EB) labor market models. $L_{i t}^{M O}$ are workers over which firms possess labor market power. LEt areemployeesthat themselves possesses labor market power. Both labor types are imperfectly substitutable, and firms are characterized by different demand (and supply) for (of) each labor type. There are two wage rates $w_{i t}^{M O}$ and $w_{i t}^{E B}$ , with $w_{i t}^{M O}~(w_{i t}^{E B})$ being below (above) the marginal revenue product of $L_{i t}^{M O}~(L_{i t}^{E B})$ 13  \n\nIn the data, I cannot differentiate between both labor types as I lack information on firms' workforce composition. Therefore, the production function (1） does not differentiate between $L_{i t}^{M O}$ and $L_{i t}^{E B}$ .Nevertheless, separating labor into $L_{i t}^{M O}$ and $L_{i t}^{E B}$ in my model is key for i) showing how labor market power can offset existing sources of between-firm wage inequality, i) offering an intuitive explanation for observing firms paying wages below and above their MRPL, and i) showing that my estimate of firm labor market power is unbiased under heterogenous workers. The latter allows me to exactly measure firm-level labor market power, which is a weighted average of both workforce types? labor market power, from firmlevel production and cost data. Although I focus on two labor types, all my derivations extend to a continuum of differentiated workers.  \n\n#### 3.2 A framework to calculate labor market power  \n\nConsider a bargaining model where risk-neutral EB-workers bargain with profit maximizing firms over rents. In contrast, MO-workers do not bargain with firms. Their wages are a function of firms’ MO-labor demand. EB-workers’ objective is to maximize wage income taking their outside option $\\overline{{w}}_{i t}^{E B}$ as given. This motivates the following Nash problem that EB-workers and firms solve:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\underset{L_{t t}^{E B},L_{t t}^{M O},w_{i t}^{E B},M_{i t},K_{i t}}{\\operatorname*{max}}[\\phi_{i t}\\log\\left(\\left(w_{i t}^{E B}-\\overline{{w}}_{i t}^{E B}\\right)L_{i t}^{E B}\\right)}\\ &{\\qquad+\\left(1-\\phi_{i t}\\right)\\log\\left(P_{i t}(Q_{i t})Q_{i t}+w_{i t}^{M O}\\left(L_{i t}^{M O}\\right)L_{i t}^{M O}-w_{i t}^{E B}L_{i t}^{E B}-z_{i t}M_{i t}-r_{i t}K_{i t}\\right)]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$r_{i t}$ and $z_{i t}$ are unit input costs for $K_{i t}$ and $M_{i t}.\\phi_{i t}\\in[0,1]$ denotes EB-workers bargaining power and $P_{i t}$ is firms’ output price. This bargaining formulation assumes i) that, in case of a breakdown of negotiations, firms earn zero profits and EB-workers receive their outside option $\\overline{{w}}_{i t}^{E B}$ and i firms face adjustment frctions preventing a costless replacement of EBworkers.14 Otherwise, firms would have no incentive to bargain with EB-workers and worker-firm bargaining could not exist in a long-run equilibrium.15 Hence, adjustment costs are a precondition for worker-side labor market power to exist. Such adjustment frictions result, among others, from unions coordinating their labor supply (McDonald & Solow (1981)) or sunk training costs (e.g. Kline et al. (2019).  \n\nFrom the first order condition for $M_{i t}$ , one can derive firms′ markups $(\\mu_{i t})$  \n\n$$\nz_{i t}=M C_{i t}\\frac{\\partial Q_{i t}(.)}{\\partial M_{i t}}\\Leftrightarrow\\mu_{i t}=\\frac{\\partial Q_{i t}(.)}{\\partial M_{i t}}\\frac{M_{i t}}{Q_{i t}}*\\frac{P_{i t}Q_{i t}}{z_{i t}M_{i t}}=\\theta_{i t}^{M}*\\frac{P_{i t}Q_{i t}}{z_{i t}M_{i t}}.\n$$  \n\n$M C_{i t}=P_{i t}/\\mu_{i t}$ denotesmarginal costsand $\\theta_{i t}^{X}$ is the output elasticity of input $X=$ $\\{L_{i t}^{M O},L_{i t}^{E B},K_{i t},M_{i t}\\}.$  \n\nFrom the first order conditions for $L_{i t}^{M O}$ and $L_{i t}^{E B}$ , we find:  \n\nand  \n\n$$\nw_{i t}^{M O}\\left(1+\\frac{\\partial w_{i t}^{M O}}{\\partial L_{i t}^{M O}}\\frac{L_{i t}^{M O}}{w_{i t}^{M O}}\\right)=w_{i t}^{M O}\\qquad\\widetilde{\\gamma_{i t}^{M O}}\\qquad=M R P L_{i t}^{M O}\n$$  \n\n$$\nw_{i t}^{E B}\\left(1-\\frac{\\phi_{i t}}{1-\\phi_{i t}}\\frac{\\pi_{i t}}{w_{i t}^{E B}L_{i t}^{E B}}\\right)=w_{i t}^{E B}\\qquad\\widetilde{\\gamma_{i t}^{E B}}\\quad=M R P L_{i t}^{E B}.\n$$  \n\nMRPLMO and and MRPLEB are the marginal revenue produes of MOo- and B-employes. $\\pi_{i t}$ denotes firm profits. It holds that $\\gamma_{i t}^{M O}>1$ as $(\\partial w_{i t}^{M O}/\\partial L_{i t}^{M O})(L_{i t}^{M O}/w_{i t}^{M O})>0$ is the inverse labor supply elasticity of MO-type labor. Conversely, $0<\\gamma_{i t}^{E B}<1$ denotes the part of EBworkers’ wages that results from rent sharing, i.e. EB-workers wages exceed their MRPL because they can bargain for a share of firm rents. As wages for EB-workers (MO-workers) are above (below) the marginal revenue product of EB-workers (MO-workers), I call $\\gamma_{i t}^{M O}$ and $\\gamma_{i t}^{E B}$ a wage markdown and markup component, respectively.  \n\nNow, I show that firm-level labor market power is a function of $\\gamma_{i t}^{M O}$ and $\\gamma_{i t}^{E B}$ .Multiplying equation (4) with $L_{i t}^{M O}/Q_{i t}$ and equation (5) with $L_{i t}^{E B}/Q_{i t}$ gives:  \n\n$$\n\\gamma_{i t}^{M O}=\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L^{M O}}}{\\theta_{i t}^{M}}\\frac{z_{i t}M_{i t}}{w_{i t}^{M O}L_{i t}^{M O}}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\gamma_{i t}^{E B}=\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L^{E B}}}{\\theta_{i t}^{M}}\\frac{z_{i t}M_{i t}}{w_{i t}^{E B}L_{i t}^{E B}},\n$$  \n\nwhich are firm-labor-type-specific expressions for labor market power. Whereas I do not focus on such worker-type-specific labor market power, equations (6) and (7) can be used by other researchers having access to linked employer-employee data to study firm-workertype-specific labor market power.  \n\nFinally, use wit Lit $w_{i t}^{E B}L_{i t}^{E B}+w_{i t}^{M O}L_{i t}^{M O}=w_{i t}L_{i t}$ and (6) and (7) to get:  \n\n$$\nw_{i t}L_{i t}=\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L^{M O}}}{\\theta_{i t}^{M}}\\frac{z_{i t}M_{i t}}{\\gamma_{i t}^{M O}}+\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L^{E B}}}{\\theta_{i t}^{M}}\\frac{z_{i t}M_{i t}}{\\gamma_{i t}^{E B}}.\n$$  \n\nRearranging terms and using (3) gives:  \n\n$$\n\\gamma_{i t}\\equiv\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L^{M O}}+\\theta_{i t}^{L^{E B}}}{\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L^{M O}}}{\\gamma_{i t}^{M O}}+\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L^{E B}}}{\\gamma_{i t}^{E B}}}=\\frac{\\theta_{i t}^{L}}{\\theta_{i t}^{M}}\\frac{z_{i t}M_{i t}}{w_{i t}L_{i t}}=\\frac{M R P L_{i t}}{w_{i t}},\n$$  \n\nbecause under standard production functions $\\theta_{i t}^{L^{M O}}+\\theta_{i t}^{L^{E B}}=\\theta_{i t}^{L}$ 6． $M R P L_{i t}$ denotes the marginal revenue product of firms² total labor and $\\gamma_{i t}$ defines  firms’ total labor market power. If $\\gamma_{i t}>1$ $(\\gamma_{i t}<1)$ , wages are below (above) the MRPL and the firm (the firm's workforce) possesses labor market power. As (9) shows, total firm labor market power is a weighted average of firm labor market power over individual worker groups.  \n\nIn my framework, workers? wages can differ on competitive labor markets $(\\gamma_{i t}=1)$ due to differences  in worker characteristics  (e.g. skill).  This heterogeneity in worker characteristics creates between-firm wage dispersion, if firms differ in their workforce compositions (and thus their MRPL).17 To see this, write average wages as:  \n\n$$\nw_{i t}=\\frac{L_{i t}^{E B}}{L_{i t}}\\frac{M R P L_{i t}^{E B}}{\\gamma_{i t}^{E B}}+\\frac{L_{i t}^{M O}}{L_{i t}}\\frac{M R P L_{i t}^{M O}}{\\gamma_{i t}^{M O}}=\\frac{M R P L_{i t}}{\\gamma_{i t}},\n$$  \n\nwhere even for Yit = $\\gamma_{i t}^{E B}=\\gamma_{i t}^{M O}=\\gamma_{i t}=1$ firm wages can differ due to differences in workforce compositions between firms / worker-firm sorting.  \n\nWithout this realistic feature, labor market power would always contribute to betweenfirm wage inequality. The extent to which labor market power can moderate between-firm wage inequality is thus the extent to which it can offset other causes of firm wage differences. Because $w_{i t}=M R P L_{i t}\\gamma_{i t}^{-1}$ , labor market power moderates between-firm wage inequality, if $M R P L_{i t}$ and $\\gamma_{i t}$ are positively correlated, which is what I document for the German manufacturing sector and ten other European countries.18 The existing rent-sharing literature could not document this fact, as it defines identical rent-sharing parameters across firms. By construction, this creates a hard-wired link between rent-sharing processes (labor market power) and between-firm pay inequality that misinterprets rent-sharing processes (labor market power) as a cause of firm pay differences. From the rent-sharing literature's perspective, my approach can thus be seen as a way to estimate firm-specific labor market power (rent-sharing parameters). Online Appendix B provides a numerical example showing that realistically small differences in firms? labor market power/rent-sharing parameters can create the inequality moderating force highlighted in this study.  \n\n#### 3.3 Estimation  \n\nBefore I calculate firms? labor market power and MRPL (equation (9)), I need to recover firms’ output elasticities. Therefore, I estimate firms’ production function. As the methodology follows previous work, I focus on key aspects and describe the estimation routine in online Appendix C in more detail.  \n\nI apply a translog production function allowing for firm- and time-specific output elasticities. The empirical production function writes:  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\pmb{\\phi}_{i t}^{\\prime}\\pmb{\\beta}+\\omega_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nLower case leters denote logs. $\\phi_{i t}^{\\prime}$ captures production inputs and their interactions.19 $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ is an i.i.d. error term. $\\omega_{i t}$ denotes Hicks-neutral productivity and follows a Markov process that firms can influence. Formally, $\\omega_{i t}=h_{i t}(\\omega_{i t-1},T_{i t-1})+\\xi_{i t}=h_{i t}(.)+\\xi_{i t}$ ，where $\\xi_{i t}$ denotes the innovation in productivity and $\\pmb{T}_{i t}=(E X_{i t},N u m P_{i t})$ captures firm actions influencing productivity. $E X_{i t}$ and $N u m P_{i t}$ denote firms’ export status and number of products. I thus allow for (dis)economies of scope and learning from export market participation to affect productivity. Whereas $\\omega_{i t}$ is unobserved to the econometrician, firms know $\\omega_{i t}$ before making their input decisions for flexible inputs (intermediates). I assume that labor and capital do not respond to productivity shocks, which is motivated by Germany's inflexible labor market setting (OECD (2018)).20  \n\nThere are three identification issues preventing a direct estimation of equation (11) by OLS. First, firms′ intermediate input decisions depend on unobserved realizations of $\\omega_{i t}$ Second, the production function (11) specifies a physical production model. Yet, while I observe firms’ physical output, I cannot aggregate it across various products of multiproduct firms (e.g. kilograms of vegetables vs. liters of beverages). Third, I do not observe input prices for all production inputs. If input prices are correlated with input decisions and output levels, this causes another endogeneity problem.  \n\nOnline Appendix C details how I address these identification issues. In summary: I address the endogeneity problem resulting from the dependence of firms’ flexible input decision  on realization  of $\\omega_{i t}$ by applying a control function approach to control for unobserved productivity following Olley & Pakes (1996). To address the issue that output quantities cannot be aggregated within multi-product firms, I calculate a firm-specific output price index as in Eslava et al. (2004). I use this price index to deflate observed firm revenue (for all firms), which purges it from price variation (I keep using $q_{i t}$ for the resulting quasiquantities). Finally, to account for unobserved input prices, I follow De Loecker et al. (2016)  \n\nand define a price control function from firms’ observed output prices and market shares to control for unobserved input price variation. The latter assumes that output prices are informative about input prices.  \n\nAfter implementing these procedures, the production function contains two additional control functions, one for unobserved productivity $(h_{i t}(.))$ and one for unobserved input prices $(B_{i t}(.))$  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\widetilde{\\pmb{\\phi}}_{i t}^{\\prime}\\pmb{\\beta}+B_{i t}(.)+h_{i t}(.)+\\xi_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}.\n$$  \n\n$\\widetilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ contains the same input terms as $\\phi_{i t}^{\\prime}$ , either deflated by an industry-deflator (capital and intermediates) or reported in true quantities (labor). The tilde highlights that some inputs do not enter in true quantities. The latter is precisely the reason for introducing the input price control function, $B_{i t}(.)$ , which controls for firm price variation and is a flexible function of output prices, product market shares, firm location, and firms’ four-digit industry classification. Finally, $h_{i t}(.)=\\omega_{i t}-\\xi_{i t}$ , is a control function for productivity based on a firm's inverted demand function for raw materials and energy inputs.  \n\nI estimate (12) separately by two-digit sectors and jointly form identifying moments on $\\xi_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}$ as in Wooldridge (2009). As mentioned, I discuss the entire approach and its assumptions in online Appendix C. Estimated average (median) output elasticities across all firms equal 0.64 (0.63) 0.30 (0.30) 0.11 (0.11) respectively for intermediate, labor, and capital inputs (online Appendix C). To ensure that I can compare statistics across firms, I only keep firms for which I can compute labor market power and marginal revenue products of labor. My final sample consists of 242,982 firm-year observations for which online Appendix A.1 summarizes key statistics.  \n\n### 4 Results  \n\nThis section shows my empirical results. Section 4.1 compares the wage and MRPL distribution over time and concludes that labor market power contributed to between-firm wage equality. Section 4.2 highlights that the key mechanism for this finding is that large, high-paying, high-MRPL firms posses the highest degree of labor market power and thus pay wages below MRPL. Section 5 will discuss the role of measurement error, adjustment costs, and characteristics of the German manufacturing sector in driving my results.  \n\n#### 4.1 Wage distribution and marginal revenue products  \n\nDISTRIBUTION OF MARGINAL REVENUE PRODUCTS OF LABOR AND WAGES ACROSS FIRMS  \n\n![](images/a000eb592ad7d58d67d66b777d60d0f47875345e148e71c87b97fa9c672522f5.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1 - Distribution of marginal revenue products of labor and average wages across firms in 1995. Results for other years look similar. Expressed in values of 1995. Germany's manufacturing sector. Sample firms.  \n\nFigure 1 shows the firm wage and MRPL distributions for the German manufacturing sector, documenting that MRPL dispersion exceeds wage dispersion. As wages are a function of firms’ MRPL and labor market power, wages would equal the MRPL in every firm on competitive labor markets. Holding marginal revenue products constant, the competitive wage distribution $(\\gamma_{i t}=1)$ ) would thus be much more dispersed than observed in the data. This even holds if firms’ marginal products decline in labor (i.e. if the MRPL distribution changes when adjusting wages). In that case, if firms adjust their labor inputs while moving from the factual case with labor market power to the counterfactually competitive labor market scenario, the MRPL and wage distributions will move towards each other, leading to a larger between-firm wage dispersion than observed in the data.21 Labor market power therefore contributes to between-firm wage equality.  \n\nTable 1 shows qualitatively the same result within each two-digit manufacturing industry of my analysis. MRPL dispersion exceeds wage dispersion in almost every industry, sometimes by a factor of more than two. Table 1 also displays industry statistics for labor market power. As labor market power creates a wedge between firms’ wages and MRPL, high (low) labor market power firms are too small (large) from an efficiency perspective. The extent of labor market power dispersion is thus a direct measure of misallocation (as in Hsieh & Klenow (2009)). Labor market power dispersion is on average larger in sectors in which wage and MRPL dispersion differ the most, highlighting a potential trade-off between the moderating effect of labor market power on firm pay differences and allocative efficiency. As I show below, this mostly results from large, high-paying, and high-MRPL firms having large and growing labor market power due to paying relatively high wages that are still far below their MRPL. This makes these firms inefficiently small, although they are already large.  \n\nFigure 2, Panel A shows how between-firm dispersion in wages and MRPL changed within the German manufacturing sector between 1995 and 2016. Over these years, betweenfirm dispersion in wages and MRPL, measured by the standard deviation (90-10 percentile difference), increased by $24\\%$ $(25\\%)$ and $26\\%$ $(18\\%)$ , reflecting an absolute increase of 2,300E (6,100e) and 5,000E (7,800E) in values of 1995, respectively.  \n\nd   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Percentile diff.

Values are normalized to unity in 1995. Germany's manufacturing sector. Sample firms.  \n\nAs, relative to wage dispersion, the level of MRPL dispersion is larger, the percentage wise similar increase in MRPL and wage dispersion implies a widening of the gap between MRPL and wage dispersion levels. Figure 2, Panel B illustrates this by plotting level differences between wage and MRPL dispersion. The documented upward trends imply that MRPL dispersion became larger over time compared to wage dispersion. The latest decrease in the difference between wage and MRPL dispersion reflects an increase in between-firm wage inequality. Here, wage dispersion catches up with the growth of MRPL dispersion  \n\nFigure 2, Panel B shows that dispersion in labor market power displayed only a slight upward trend in past decades. This is because firms labor market power is defined as the ratio (not the difference) between wages and the MRPL. Nevertheless, as MRPL dispersion increases stronger than wage dispersion in terms of Euro levels, there is an increasingly strong moderating effect of labor market power on the increase in between-firm wage inequality over time. Under competitive labor markets, wage inequality between firms would thus have grown stronger.  \n\nTABLE 2   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"9\">SELECTEDPERCENTILEDIFFERENCESFORFIRMWAGESANDMARGINALREVENUEPRODUCTSOFLABOR OVERTIME,ENTIREMANUFACTURINGSECTOR</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Year</td><td colspan=\"3\">Percentiledifferencesfirmwages</td><td colspan=\"4\">PercentiledifferencesfirmMRPL</td></tr><tr><td>90-10</td><td colspan=\"2\">90-50</td><td colspan=\"3\">90-10</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Diff.between column4and1 (7)</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>50-10 (3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>90-50 (5)</td><td>50-10 (6)</td></tr><tr><td>1995</td><td>24,525</td><td>12,041</td><td>12,484</td><td>43,502</td><td>28,724</td><td>14,778</td><td>18,977</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>27,148</td><td>13,492</td><td>13,656</td><td>46,775</td><td>31,247</td><td>15,528</td><td>19,628</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>29,141</td><td>14,766</td><td>14,375</td><td>52,861</td><td>35,763</td><td>17,098</td><td>23,720</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>28,869</td><td>15,641</td><td>13,228</td><td>53,292</td><td>36,991</td><td>16,302</td><td>24,423</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>30,578</td><td>16,687</td><td>13,891</td><td>51,321</td><td>35,037</td><td>16,284</td><td>20,743</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table 2 reports 90-10, 90-50, and 50-10 percentile differences of the firm distribution for wages and marginal revenue products of labor. Wages and marginal revenue products of labor are expressed in values of 1995. Germany's manufacturing sector. Sample firms.  \n\nTable 2 shows that most of the increase in wage and MRPL dispersion occurs in the upper part of the distributions. For wages, the 90-50 percentile difference was even below the 50- 10 difference in 1995. Over time, however, the former increased from 12,000E to 16,500E, whereas the 50-10 percentile difference only increased from 12,500f to 14,000e (in values of 1995). For the MRPL distribution, the importance of the upper half of the distribution in explaining the increase in MRPL dispersion is even larger. Firms at the upper ends of the wage and MRPL distributions have thus a significant role in explaining the observed increase in wage and MRPL dispersion.  \n\nTable 3 documents a strong increase in wage and MRPL dispersion also within narrow four-digit industries and German federal states (Germany consists of 16 federal states). Table 3 shows selected year coefficients from regressing percentile differences from the wage and MRPL distributions on a full set of year and four-digit industry (federal state) dummies using OLS were 1995 is the baseline category. The coefficients for the year dummies reflect the average change in percentile differences within four-digit industries and within regions between 1995 and the reported year.  \n\nTABLE 3   \nSELECTED PERCENTILE DIFFERENCES FOR FIRM WAGES AND MARGINAL REVENUE PRODUCTS OF LABOR OVER TIME, WITHIN FOUR-DIGIT INDUSTRIES AND FEDERAL STATES.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Coefficienton year dummies</td><td colspan=\"3\">Percentile differences firm wages</td><td colspan=\"3\">Percentile differences firm MRPL</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Diff.column 4 and 1 (7)</td></tr><tr><td>90-10 (1)</td><td>90-50 (2)</td><td>50-10 (3)</td><td>90-10 (4)</td><td>90-50 (5)</td><td>50-10 (6)</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>795.1 (339.2)</td><td>662.8 (259.2)</td><td>132.4 (245.6)</td><td>2,660 (925.0)</td><td>2,506 (802.9)</td><td>154.0 (409.9)</td><td>1,864.9</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>2,674 (336.3)</td><td>1,937 (260.3)</td><td>737.1 (259.0)</td><td>5,730 (911.8)</td><td>4,167 (841.2)</td><td>1,562 (365.9)</td><td>3,056.0</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2,481 (342.7)</td><td>2,600 (283.1)</td><td>-118.9 (237.0)</td><td>6,982 (1,062)</td><td>6,049 (951.9)</td><td>932.9 (370.3)</td><td>2,481.0</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2,597 (370.0)</td><td>2,662 (306.0)</td><td>-65.32 (257.4)</td><td>5,688 (1,113)</td><td>5,181 (1,048)</td><td>506.8 (373.5)</td><td>3,091.0</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel A: Within four-digit industries   \nPanel B: Within federal states   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Coefficienton year dummies</td><td colspan=\"3\">Percentiledifferencesfirmwages</td><td colspan=\"3\">Percentile differences firm MRPL</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Diff.column 4 and 1 (7)</td></tr><tr><td>90-10 (1)</td><td>90-50 (2)</td><td>50-10 (3)</td><td>90-10 (4)</td><td>90-50 (5)</td><td>50-10 (6)</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>3,811 (804.1)</td><td>2,700 (703.8)</td><td>1,111 (294.5)</td><td>3,292 (1,342)</td><td>2,565 (1,354)</td><td>727.9 (507.7)</td><td>-519.0</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>5,794 (379.5)</td><td>2,996 (352.6)</td><td>2,798 (283.4)</td><td>10,566 (1,393)</td><td>7,997 (1,283)</td><td>2,569 (438.4)</td><td>4,772.0</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>5,626 (579.0)</td><td>3,835 (369.5)</td><td>1,791 (379.0)</td><td>11,633 (1,339)</td><td>9,593 (1,204)</td><td>2,040 (396.7)</td><td>6,007.0</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>6,709 (943.1)</td><td>4,391 (513.1)</td><td>2,318 (548.3)</td><td>9,344 (1,169)</td><td>7,930 (1,062)</td><td>1,415 (513.1)</td><td>2,635.0</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table 3 reports coefficients and standard errors from regressions of 90-10, 90-50, and 50-10 percentile differences on a full set of year dummies and either a full set of four-digit industry dummies (Panel A) or a full set of federal state dummies (Panel B). The coefficients report the average changes in percentile differences within four-digit industries (Panel A) or federal states (Panel B), relative to the base year 1995. Columns 1-3 show percentile differences for firm wages. Columns 4-6 show percentile differences for firms’ marginal revenue products of labor. Standard errors are reported in parentheses and clustered at the four-digit industry (Panel A) or federal state (Panel B) level. Euro values of 1995. Germany's manufacturing sector. Sample firms.  \n\nThe coefficients on 2016 indicate that the 90-10 percentile difference for firm wages and marginal revenue products of labor increased by 2,600E and 5,700E within four-digit industries (Panel A) and by 6,700E and 9,300E within federal states (Panel B), respectively.22 As the increase in MRPL dispersion is much larger than the increase in wage dispersion, firm heterogeneities in labor market power moderated the increase in between-firm wage inequality also within narrow industries and regions.  \n\nConsistent with evidence on the entire manufacturing sector, Table 3 shows that also within four-digit industries and regions, wage and MRPL dispersion mostly grew due to a widening of 90-50 percentile differences. Changes in the upper parts of these distributions were several times larger than changes in the corresponding 50-10 percentile differences. The next section investigates this key role of the upper percentiles in more detail.  \n\n#### 4.2  The role of high-paying, large, and high-MRPL firms  \n\nTable 4 reports averages for wages, marginal revenue products of labor, labor productivity (log of value-added over employment, denoted by “labor prod.\"), firms’ product market power/markups (calculated from equation (4), denoted by PMP), and firms? labor market power (LMP) for ventiles of the firm employment, wage, and MRPL distributions (I divide each distribution into twenty equally sized parts).  \n\nIn addition to highlighting the strong persistence of firms? MRPL being much more dispersed than firms’ wages, Table 4 provides several key insights. First, note that for most of the wage distribution, marginal revenue products of labor are close to wages. Just after the $70^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of the wage distribution, the wedge between wages and marginal revenue products widens and increases further when moving to the top ventiles (columns 1 and 2). Similarly, except for the first ventile, firm labor market power stays around unity until the $70^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile. The further we move beyond the $70^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile, the larger the average degree of firms? labor market power. Labor market power is thus concentrated in high-paying firms. The latter is in line with existing evidence i) suggesting that high-paying firms can lower wages and create rents by hiding behind industry-wide wage standards (Hirsch & Mueller (2020) and i) documenting for specific occupational fields that firms exert labor market power particularly over high-paid workers.23 Notably, product market power, while slightly increasing, stays on similar levels along the wage distribution.  \n\nLooking at the firm size and MRPL distributions, I find that small and low-MRPL firms pay low wages that are below marginal revenue products of labor. This implies that employees possess themselves labor market power within these firms (columns 6, 7, 11, and 12).24 Moving to upper ventiles, wages and marginal revenue products become larger. Slightly above the median of both distributions, marginal revenue products exceed wages, eventually becoming much larger than wages at the top ventiles. Accordingly, firms? labor market power steadily grows along the firm size and MRPL distributions, reaching extreme values for the largest and highest-MRPL firms. The positive association between size and marginal revenue products of labor highlights the exceptional productivity of large firms. This is because, holding productivity constant, firms’ MRPL decreases in the number of employees, whereas higher firm productivity levels shift up a firm's MPRL for a given firm size.25  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>MeanvaluesforMRPLventiles PMP Labor prod.

MRPL-wage differences in high-paying, large, and high-MRPL firms are thus the main reason for why the MRPL distribution is more dispersed than the wage distribution. As consequence, the extreme labor market power of top firms heavily contributes to between-firm wage equality.  \n\nFinally, note that highly productive firms are large, pay high wages, and have high marginal revenue products of labor (columns 3, 6, and 9). Furthermore, product market power is less dispersed than labor market power and falls with firms? size and MRPL, while it slightly grows with wages. This is consistent with i) high product market power firms being forced to share rents with their workforce (Nickell (1999)) and i) large firms expanding their product mix into competitive product markets (e.g. predatory pricing), while generating most of their rents from labor markets. The extreme labor market power, compared to low product market power levels, of large, high-paying, and high-MRPL firms offers an appealing explanation for the success of these firms: Although such “superstar firms\"’ pay high wages, the return on their workers is larger. This allows these “superstars\"’ to create high labor market rents and to be profitable despite selling on competitive product markets.  \n\nFigures 3 and 4 show that the key role of large, high-wage, and high-MRPL firms in contributing to wage and MRPL dispersion grows over time. Both figures plot changes in wages, MRPL, and labor market power for the bottom and top ventiles of the wage, size, and MRPL distributions. Panel A and B of Figure 3 show that wages and marginal revenue products of labor steadily grew for the top ventiles, while they stayed constant or slightly declined for the bottom ventile firms. Again, marginal products grew stronger than wages for the top ventiles. Figure 4 shows that there is even a slightly increasing labor market power trend for top ventile firms. Recap, even a stable trend in labor market power implies a widening of MRPL-wage gaps in these firms. The slight upward trend in labor market power for top firms thus implies a strong increase in their labor market rents.26  \n\n#### FIRM WAGES AND MRPL OVER TIME FOR TOP AND BOTTOM VENTILE FIRMS  \n\n![](images/31ed104b45713f65d655167dd83834a691dd1de8ba5b0dd79a96376f4e56dc97.jpg)  \nPanel A: Firm wages over time  \n\n![](images/eafff7b0b84822c1647e3349edbbccf4c685c2bdc429f186ffbf76444bc9fb97.jpg)  \nPanel B: Firm MRPL over time  \n\nFIGURE 3 - Average firm wages and MRPL over time for the top and bottom ventiles of the firm wage, size, and MRPL distributions.

Germany's manufacturing sector. Sample firms.  \n\nIn contrast, bottom ventile firms show a stable or even declining labor market power trend. This can be seen most clearly from comparing high- and low-wage firms in Figure 4.  \n\nBoth firm types had equal labor market power levels in 1995. Yet, high-wage firms significantly increased their labor market power, while low-wage firms? labor market power strongly declined over time. Although wages departed for both groups, the differential evolution of high- and low-wage firms? labor market power alleviated the increase in firm wage differences over the past decades.  \n\n### 5  Discussion and replication for other countries  \n\n#### 5.1 Measurement error: discussion and alternative estimates  \n\nMy estimation of the MRPL is based on a complex production function estimation routine. Hence, there might be concerns about measurement error causing MRPL dispersion to be larger than wage dispersion. As my results are driven by the right tails of the firm wage, size, and MRPL distributions, any measurement error relevant for explaining my findings would need to create an upward bias in labor market power for the upper parts of these distributions. Hence, my results cannot be driven by statistical noise.  \n\nIt is also unlikely that adjustment costs unrelated to labor market power drive my results because MRPL-wage differences are larger in top firms and grow over time. Particularly, growing labor or skill shortage cannot explain the increase in measured labor market rents at top firms because it is well-documented that, for Germany, skill shortage is lowest for the largest firms and that large firms generate sufficiently high profits to pay higher wages, which could raise labor supply (Dettman et al. (2019)). Finally, my findings are consistent with recent evidence showing that firms exert high labor market power over high-paid workers (Goolsbee & Syverson (2019); Gibson (2020); Bachmann et al. (2020)), providing support for an inequality-moderating effect of labor market power in high-wage segments. Also numerically, measurement error would need to be unrealistically high to compensate MRPL-wage differences at top firms that drive my results. Depending on the distribution (wages, employment, or MRPL) average marginal revenue products of labor exceed average Wagesby $15\\%$ to $215\\%$ in the top three ventiles.  \n\nNevertheless, to provide some robustness analysis, I replicate core results using a much simpler Cobb-Douglas specification and i) a time-varying version of my baseline translog production model that estimates production function coefficients separately by years in online Appendix E. The latter specification also accounts for industry-level biased technological change that affects the relative marginal products of input factors as it allows the coefficients of the production function to vary over time (De Loecker et al. (2020)). My results hold for both robustness checks.  \n\n#### 5.2 Replication for other countries  \n\nAnother concern could be that factors specific to the German manufacturing sector drive my results. For instance, the German manufacturing sector is characterized by a high coverage of industry-level bargained wage standards. This might cause the wage distribution to be narrower than in other sectors and countries and might be one factor creating labor market power. To test for the external validity of my results, I replicate key findings for ten other European countries using the CompNet data.27 As mentioned, the CompNet data includes information on almost all economic sectors (see online Appendix A.2). Therefore, the results below are not subject to any sector specificities.  \n\nTABLE 5   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">MRPLANDFIRMWAGEDISPERSIONINSEVERALEUROPEANCOUNTRIES</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">90-10 percentile differences,wage</td><td>90-10 percentile differences,MRPL</td><td>Timetrendofdifferences betweenMRPLandwage</td></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td>Years</td><td>Average firm wage</td><td>distribution</td><td>distribution</td><td>dispersion (5)</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>(1) 2006-2019</td><td>(2) 30,676.12</td><td>(3) 28,296.22</td><td>(4) 64,539.35</td><td>-1,320.67***(225.01)</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td></td><td></td><td>26,296.81</td><td>66,736.65</td><td>-147.62 (264.10)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2008-2018</td><td>28,176.89</td><td>32,338.87</td><td>82,421.75</td><td>482.81***(143.82)</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>2000-2018</td><td>39,470.57</td><td>22,323.28</td><td>53,789.52</td><td>556.94***(103.24)</td></tr><tr><td>Slovenia</td><td>2002-2019</td><td>25,414.64</td><td>19,840.09</td><td>36,673.02</td><td>302.05***(38.33)</td></tr><tr><td>Poland Croatia</td><td>2002-2019 2002-2019</td><td>16,750.54 14,171.30</td><td>15,681.26</td><td>70,533.57</td><td>-1,386.22*** (241.19)</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>2004-2016</td><td>29,565.18</td><td>33,534.12</td><td>101,603.2</td><td>-1,185.22(874.48)</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>1999-2019</td><td>29,548.92</td><td>23,098.78</td><td>55,550.73</td><td>-559.51***(84.22)</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>2003-2019</td><td>37,512.13</td><td>32,146.18</td><td>14,9761.3</td><td>-1,222.56**(516.85)</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>2009-2018</td><td>53,517.75</td><td>44,752.45</td><td>66,230.91</td><td>53.64 (272.01)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table 5 shows MRPL and firm wage dispersion for several European countries. Column (1) reports the years of observation, column (2) reports the average firm wage and column (3) and (4) respectively show average 90-10 percentile differences for firms’ wages and MRPL across all years (values of 2005, PPP deflated). Column (5) reports the coefficient from a regression of the difference in wage and MRPL dispersion (column (4) minus column (3) for every year) on a linear time trend. Robust standard errors for column (5) are reported in parentheses. Significance: $^{*10}$ percent, $**5$ percent, $^{***1}$ percent.CompNet data.  \n\nTable 5 shows country-level average 90-10 percentile differences for wage and MRPL distributions for several European countries.28 In every country of the sample, MRPL dispersion exceeds wage dispersion. Hence, in all countries, labor market power contributes to between-firm wage equality.  \n\nColumn 4 shows coefficients from a regression of the difference between MRPL and wage dispersion on a linear time trend. A positive coefficient implies that MRPL dispersion grows stronger than wage dispersion, implying that the moderating effect of labor market power on firm pay differences increases over time. Results are more mixed with respect to this analysis. In Italy, Croatia, Finland, and Sweden the inequality moderating effect of labor market power decreases over time, whereas in Belgium, Slovenia, and Poland, it became stronger in past years. Results for Spain, Denmark, and Switzerland are inconclusive. Yet, in all countries, MRPL dispersion exceeds wage dispersion in every year of the data (see also online Appendix G). Hence, there is a persistent inequality moderating effect of labor market power in all ten countries.  \n\nTable 6 replicates key results from Table 4 for my set of European countries using the “joint distributions” from the CompNet data. These “joint distributions” report median values of several variables by deciles of another variable's distribution. To condense my analysis for multiple countries, I run the following regressions:  \n\n$$\n\\bar{y}_{n d t}=\\beta_{d e c i l e\\_}d e c i l e\\_x_{n d t}+\\upsilon_{t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\overline{{y}}_{n d t}=\\{L M P,P M P,f i r m w a g e,M R P L,\\}$ is the median value of a variable of interest and  decile $\\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{x}}_{n d t}=\\{1,2,\\dots,10\\}$ denotes deciles, $d$ ，of the distribution of $x=$ {wage, MRPL, size,labor productivity} in country $n$ and year $t$ $\\upsilon_{t}$ is a year fixed effect. The coefficients $\\beta_{d e c i l e\\_x}$ , which I report in Table 6, give the percentage increase in ${\\bar{y}}_{n d t}$ when moving up one decile of the distribution of $x$  \n\nResults are consistent with evidence for the German manufacturing sector. With only a few expectations, MRPL-wage differences, which can be calculated from subtracting columns (1)-(4) from columns (5)-(8), are growing when moving up the wage, MRPL, size, and productivity distributions. The key mechanism reported in this study, that high wages are associated with higher labor market rents of firms which exerts a strong moderating effect of labor market power on firm pay differences is thus validated for almost all countries. Only in Switzerland, wages grow stronger than MRPL along the size distributions. Yet, even here, MRPL growth exceeds wage growth along the MRPL and size distributions.  \n\nAs columns (9)-(16) show, labor (product) market power grows (slightly falls) along the wage, MRPL, and productivity distributions in most countries. This is consistent with evidence on Germany and shows that high wage and highly productive firms generate large labor market rents while being active on competitive product markets.  \n\nIn sum, I therefore conclude that the inequality moderating effect of labor market power, particularly driven from high labor market power at high-paying “superstar? firms, is a widespread phenomenon across several European countries and sectors and not just a specificity of the German manufacturing sector.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>PMP along wage, MRPL, size, a distributions distrib.</td><td>Size distril MRPL distrib.

I show that firms? labor market power had an important moderating effect on the documented rise in between-firm wage inequality. This holds at the aggregate manufacturing sector level, within regions, and within narrow industries. The mechanism behind this finding is that small, low-wage, low-MRPL firms possess no labor market power and pay wages equal to or above their MRPL, whereas large, high-wage, high-MRPL firms, possess high labor market power and pay wages far below their MRPL. These labor market power heterogeneities compress the firm wage distribution relative to a counterfactually competitive labor market and contribute to between-firm wage equality. Over past decades, this inequality moderating effect of labor market power became increasingly stronger.  \n\nParticularly in the largest, highest-paying, and highest-MRPL firms, which are also the most productive firms, MRPL-wage differences strongly widen over time. Despite wages grew within these top firms, the larger increase in their MRPL implies that these firms' (rising) labor market power exerts a strong moderating effect on (rising) between-firm wage inequality. This is because under competitive labor markets, wage gains would have been even larger in these top firms. While these “superstar firms\"” generate enormous rents from labor markets, they are active on competitive product markets. This highlights the relevance of labor markets rents for “superstar firms” and provides new insights on why such firms are particularly profitable and successful.  \n\nI show that my findings are not unique to the German manufacturing sector. Instead, the inequality-moderating effect of labor market power from high-wage, high-productivity firms paying wages far below competitive levels is a robust feature of several other European countries and occurs also outside of manufacturing.  \n\nMy findings challenge the view that labor market power causes firm wage differences, which is a key feature of a large labor market literature and a main result of the rent-sharing literature (Card et al. (2018). The main difference between my approach and the existing rent-sharing literature is that I allow for firm heterogeneities in labor market power (or rentsharing parameters). Without such heterogeneities, there is a positive connection between labor market power and between-firm wage differences by construction. My findings therefore call for a serious reevaluation of this long-standing view. Overall, my results are supportive of factors other than labor market power causing firm wage differences, like differences in worker skills, production technologies, or firm-worker sorting effects.  \n\nFinally, my study informs recent debates on the effects of firm labor market power and the design of policies to regulate it. Policies addressing labor market power targeted at lowwage firms are unlikely to successfully reduce labor market power as most of it is concentrated in high-paying and highly productive firms. Firms that pay on average low wages are not necessarily monopsonists but may pay low wages because of low marginal revenue products. Binding minimum wages would make these firms unprofitable and force them to exit the market. The design of policies targeted at the regulation of labor markets must consider such characteristics of labor market power.  \n\n### References  \n\nAbowd, J. M., Kramarz, F., & Margolis, D. N.

Data request can be made at: https://www.forschungsdatenzentrum.de/en/request.  \n\nThe statistics that I used are: “AFiD-Modul Produkte\", “AFiD-Panel Industriebetriebe\", “AFiD-Panel Industrieunternehmen\", “Investitionserhebung im Bereich Verarbeitendes Gewerbe, Bergbau und Gewinnung von Steinen und Erden\",“Panel der Kostenstrukturerhebung im Bereich Verarbeitendes Gewerbe, Bergbau und Gewinnung von Steinen und Erden'. The data are combined by the statistical offices and provided as a merged dataset.  \n\n#### Variable definitions  \n\nThe following list presents an overview on the variable definitions of all variables used in this article. This includes variables used in other sections of the online Appendix.  \n\n$L_{i t}$ : Labor in headcounts.   \n$w_{i t}$ : Firm wage (firm average), defined as gross salary $+$ “other social expenses\" (latter includes expenditures for company outings, advanced training, and similar costs) divided by the number of employees.   \n$K_{i t}$ : Capital derived by a perpetual inventory method (see online Appendix D), where investment captures firms’ total investment in buildings, equipment, machines, and Mertens 41 other investment goods. Nominal values are deflated by a two-digit industry-level deflator supplied by the statistical office of Germany. $M_{i t}$ : Deflated total intermediate input expenditures, defined as expenditures for raw materials, energy, intermediate services, goods for resale, renting, temporary agency workers, repairs, and contracted work conducted by other firms. Nominal values are deflated by a 2-digit industry-level deflator supplied by the statistical office of Germany. $z_{i t}M_{i t}$ : Nominal values of total intermediate input expenditures. $P_{i t}Q_{i t}$ : Nominal output / nominal total revenue, defined as total gross output, including, among others, sales from own products, sales from intermediate goods, revenue from offered services, and revenue from commissions/brokerage. $Q_{i t}$ : Quasi-quantity measure of physical output, i.e. $P_{i t}Q_{i t}$ deflated by a firm-specific price index (denoted by $\\pi_{i t}$ , see the definition of $\\pi_{i t}$ below).29 $\\pi_{i t}$ : Firm-specific Tornqvist price index, derived as in Eslava, Haltiwanger, Kugler, & Kugler (2004). See the online Appendix C for its construction.   \n· $p_{i g t}$ : Price of a product $g$ ，   \n· $s h a r e_{i g t}$ : Revenue share of a product $g$ in total firm revenue. $m s_{i t}$ : Weighted average of firms? product market shares in terms of revenues. The weights are the sales of each product in firms′ total product market sales. $G_{i t}$ : Headquarter location of the firm. $90\\%$ of firms in my sample are single-plant firms. $D_{i t}$ : A four-digit industry indicator variable. The industry of each firm is defined as the industry in which the firm generates most of its sales.   \n$E_{i t}$ (or in logs, $e_{i t}$ ): Deflated expenditures for raw materials and energy inputs. Nominal values are deflated by a 2-digit industry-level deflator for intermediate inputs and which is supplied by the statistical office of Germany. $E_{i t}$ is part of $M_{i t}$ $E x p_{i t}$ : Dummy-variable being one, if firms generate export market sales.   \n$N u m P_{i t}$ : The number of products a firm produces.  \n\n#### Summary statistics, German manufacturing sector data  \n\nTABLE A.1   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\">SUMMARYSTATISTICSFORSAMPLEFIRMS</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>Sd</td><td>P25</td><td>Median</td><td>P75</td><td>Observations</td></tr><tr><td>Variable</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>Average real wage</td><td>33,560</td><td>11,091</td><td>25,666</td><td>33,211</td><td>40,646</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Labor market power parameter</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.51</td><td>.069</td><td>0.93</td><td>1.25</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>MRPL</td><td>35,348</td><td>23,301</td><td>19,787</td><td>29,650</td><td>44,440</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Product market power parameter</td><td>1.09</td><td>0.18</td><td>0.97</td><td>1.05</td><td>1.17</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Numberofemployees</td><td>303.74</td><td>2,220.89</td><td>47</td><td>94</td><td>223</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Deflated capital stock in thousands</td><td>39,900</td><td>408,000</td><td>2,384</td><td>6,673</td><td>21,100</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Deflated intermediate input expenditures in thousands</td><td>49,200</td><td>743,000</td><td>2,649</td><td>7,047</td><td>22,400</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Deflated capital per employee in thousands</td><td>95.97</td><td>96.04</td><td>38.03</td><td>68.54</td><td>119.88</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Value-added overrevenue</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.49</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Value-addedlabor share</td><td>0.78</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.63</td><td>0.76</td><td>0.88</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Nominal revenue in thousands</td><td>74,200</td><td>1,000,000</td><td>5,097</td><td>12,400</td><td>37,100</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Log of real value-added per employee</td><td>10.55</td><td>0.87</td><td>10.12</td><td>10.61</td><td>11.06</td><td>222,215</td></tr><tr><td>Number of products</td><td>3.60</td><td>6.72</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Exportstatus dummy</td><td>0.78</td><td>0.42</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue weighted product market shares</td><td>10.79</td><td>17.65</td><td>0.77</td><td>3.23</td><td>12.28</td><td>242,982</td></tr><tr><td>(euro-based, in percent) Average real wage</td><td>33,560</td><td>11,091</td><td>25,666</td><td>33,211</td><td>40,646</td><td>242,982</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table A.1 reports sample summary statistics. Columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively report the mean, standard deviation, $25^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile, median, $75^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile, and the number of observations used to produce summary statistics for therespectivevariable.  \n\n#### Deriving a time consistent industry classification  \n\nDuring my 22 years of data, the NACE classification of industry sectors (and thus firms into industries) changed twice. Once in 2002 and once in 2008. Because my estimation of labor market power relies on having a time-consistent industry classification at the firm level (as I allow for sector-specific production functions and as I use sector-specific deflators) it is crucial for me to recover a time-consistent NACE industry classification. Recovering such a time-consistent  industry classification from official concordance tables is, however, problematic as they contain many ambiguous sector reclassifications.  \n\nTo address this issue, I follow the procedure described in Mertens (2020a) and use information on firms’ product mix to classify firms into NACE rev 1.1 sectors based on their main production activities. This procedure exploits that the first four digits of the ten-digit GP product classification reported in the German data are identical to the NACE sector classification (i.e. they indicate the industry of the product). Obviously, applying this method demands a consistent reclassification of all products into the GP2002 scheme (which corresponds to the NACE rev 1.1 scheme). Reclassifying products is, however, due to the granularity of the ten-digit classification, less ambiguous than reclassifying industries. In the few ambiguous cases, I can follow the firms’ product mix over the reclassification periods and unambiguously reclassify most products (i.e. I observe what firms produce before and after  reclassification  years).  Having   constructed  a  time-consistent  product-industry classification according to the GP2002 scheme, I attribute every firm to the NACE rev 1.1 industry in which it generates most of its revenue.30 When comparing my classification with the one of the statistical offices for the years 2002-2008 (years in which industries are already reported in NACE rev 1.1), I find that my two-digit and four-digit classification of firms into industries matches the classification of the statistical offices in $95\\%$ and $86\\%$ Oof all cases, respectively.  \n\nTable A.2 provides a few examples on the product classifications within the product-level data used to calculate firm-specific price indices as described in online Appendix D. Table A.2 is taken from Mertens & Muller (2020).  \n\nTABLE A.2   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">EXAMPLESOFINDUSTRYANDPRODUCTCLASSIFICATIONS</td></tr><tr><td>NACE rev. 1.1</td><td colspan=\"2\">Product code</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>18 1821</td><td rowspan=\"3\">182112410(0)</td><td rowspan=\"10\"></td><td>Manufacture of wearing apparel; dressing and dyeing of fur</td></tr><tr><td>Products</td><td>Manufacture ofworkwear</td></tr><tr><td>Long trousers for men, cotton (not contracted)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"9\">27 2743</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>182112510(0) 182112510(2)</td><td>Overalls for men, cotton (not contracted)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Overalls for men, cotton (contracted production)</td></tr><tr><td>182121350(2)</td><td>Coats for women, chemical fiber (contracted production)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Manufactureofbasicmetals Lead, zinc, and tin production</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>274312300(0)</td><td>Products</td></tr><tr><td>274311300(0)</td><td>Zinc, unwrought, refined (not contracted)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Lead, unwrought, refined (not contracted)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>274311500(0)</td><td>Lead,unwrought,with antimony (not contracted)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>274328300(0)</td><td>Tin sheets and tapes, thicker than 0.2mm (not contracted)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>274328600(0)</td><td>Tin sheets and tapes, not thicker than O.2mm (not contracted)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table A.2 presents examples of the products available in our data. The reported GP2002 product codes define 6,500 distinct products at the nine-digit level from which we find 5,927 in our database and 4,194 in our final sample of firms. The last number of each product code ( $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$ position)indicateswhether the product was manufactured as contracted work (2). Source: Mertens & Muiller (2020).  \n\n#### Appendix A.2: The CompNet data  \n\nThe CompNet data - collection and vintages  \n\nThe CompNet data is collected by running harmonized data collection protocols over administrative firm-level data located in several national statistical institutes and central banks. These firm-level databases are arguably the best (in terms of coverage, quality, representativeness) available firm-level data sources for the respective countries included in CompNet. The data collection protocols calculate harmonized performance measures and other variables at the firm-level and aggregate these results to the two-digit-industry-, NUTS2-, one-digit-sector-, and country-level. A key feature of these aggregate statistics is that they also contain detailed information on the distribution (standard deviations, selected percentiles) of variables, allowing researchers to understand firm heterogeneity within the aggregation levels. After having executed the data collection protocols, data providers (statistical institutes and central banks) send back the aggregated results to the Scientific Staff of CompNet which combines the results into a final database. More details on this procedure can be found on: https://www.comp-net.org/data/7th-vintage/.  \n\nAn important feature of the CompNet data is that it provides population weighted and non-population weighted versions of the data.31 I focus on the former, but replications of my results using the non-weighted version did not change any results.  \n\nThe data collection is done every 12-16 months. The information gathered varies between each data collection round, while there is a certain set of key variables included in every data collection. The results from the data collection are published as so called \"CompNet vintages\". The most recent publicly available data vintage is the $7^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vintage. The data I use comes from the $8^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vintage of the CompNet data, which I access via an earlyaccess account. I do so, because key information on the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL) is not included in the $7^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vintage. Due to using the early-access version, my data does not contain all countries eventually being included in the publicly available $8^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vintage data that is planned to be published in autumn 2021 (also Germany is not included in my data).32 Details on the most recent and older vintages can be found on the CompNet webpage: https://www.comp-net.org/data/7th-vintage/. For a detailed treatment of the data, I refer to the most recent User-Guide version, which is constantly updated and can be accessed via the same weblink above.  \n\n#### Coverage and scope  \n\nAs in previous vintages, the early-access data of the $8^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vintage features information on almost all economic sectors. The data excludes agriculture and financial services as well as firms active in mining and quarrying. Moreover, the data contains only a restricted number of public service sectors. Overall, the data covers firms from nine broader sector categories:  \n\nManufacturing   \nConstruction   \nWholesale and retail trade   \nTransportation and storage   \nAccommodation and food service activities   \nInformation and Communication   \nReal estate activities  \n\nProfessional, scientific, and technical activities Administrative and support service  \n\nNotably, not every country provides information on all sectors.

Column (1) reports the years of coverage, column (2) lists the one-digit sectors excluded from the underlying firm-level dataset, column (3) shows the number of firms with wage and MRPL information in the underlying firm-level data (firm numbers for MRPL observations are reported in brackets), and column (4) reports the average population number of firms as reported on Eurostat. All statistics refer to firms with at least 20 employees.  \n\n#### Variables and statistics used from the CompNet data  \n\nThe variables I use from the CompNet data are deflated average firm wages, firm labor market power, firm product market power, firm MRPL, firm size (number of employees), and the log of firm-level labor productivity (value-added divided by employees).  \n\nFrom the various data files in the CompNet data, I use the unconditional country- and one-digit sector-level data containing percentile values and standard deviations for all my variables of interest for every country and year. Additionally, I use the so called “joint distributions” that provide percentiles of my variables of interest by deciles of other variables.  \n\nNotably, as opposed to the sophisticated production function estimation of the main text, the market power measures as well as the MRPL I use from the CompNet data are based on a simple Cobb-Douglas production function estimated by OLS and which do not account for firm-specific price variation. The CompNet data also provides these variables based on a translog production function estimated by following the control function approach of Ackerberg, Caves, Frazer (2015), but due to this being the much more demanding specification in terms of data, the “joint distributions” only contain market power and MRPL estimates for the basic Cobb-Douglas specification estimated by OLS.33  \n\nI nevertheless checked my results on the distribution of firms’ MRPL being much more dispersed than the distribution of firm wages using the more sophisticated versions of the MRPL in the unconditional country- and one-digit-sector-level files and found that they are highly robust across the various production function specifications.  \n\nFor more details on the CompNet data and its variables, I refer to CompNet's User-Guide (CompNet 2020).34  \n\n#### Data access  \n\nResearchers can request data access to the CompNet data via: https://www.iwh-halle.de/en/research/data-and-analysis/research-data-centre/compnetdatabase/request-form/  \n\n#### Appendix B: Numerical example on how labor market power offsets existing firm pay differences  \n\nTo illustrate that even small differences in labor market power can have large impacts on firm wage differences, let us use a simple example from the rent-sharing literature: The rentsharing literature typically uses a rent-sharing/bargaining model to express wages $(w_{i t})$ as a function of workers outside options $(\\overline{{w}}_{i t})$ , profits per employees (or quasi-rents per employees), $\\frac{\\pi_{i t}}{L_{i t}}$ , and a rent-sharing parameter $(\\chi_{i t})$  \n\n$$\nw_{i t}=\\overline{{w}}_{i t}+\\chi_{i t}\\frac{\\pi_{i t}}{L_{i t}}.\n$$  \n\nNote that (B.1) is similar to equation (5) of the main text. From that, existing work motivates the estimation of rent-sharing parameters $(\\chi_{i t})$ from regressing wages on valueadded based labor productivity (Card et al. (2018), which comes from multiplying $\\frac{\\pi_{i t}}{L_{i t}}$ with the value-added over profits (or quasi-rents) ratio. Using the resulting elasticity of wages to changes in labor productivity, existing work argues that productivity dispersion can cause significant wage dispersion through rent-sharing processes. For instance, using a rent-sharing elasticity of 0.08, Card et al. (2018) argue that a productivity spread between the $90^{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of the (log) labor productivity distribution of 1.6, as reported in their data, implies a Lester range of wage variability between firms at the $90^{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of $1.6*0.08\\approx13$ log points.  \n\nLet us assume that the $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $90^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile have values of 10 and 11.6, which are realistic values (see Table A.1). If the rent-sharing elasticity between these firms just differs by a factor of (10/11.6), rent sharing will create no wage variability at all: $10*0.08=$ $11.6*0.08$ (10/11.6). Hence, if firms at the $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile have a rent-sharing elasticity of 0.08, firms at the $90^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile would just need to have a rent-sharing elasticity of 0.069 to eliminate the entire transmission from productivity dispersion to wage dispersion. If highproductivity firms have an even lower rent-sharing elasticity, the part of wages due to rentsharing will even be lower in high-productivity firms. This would reduce any existing wage differences between high and low-productivity firms, as long as high-productivity firms still pay higher wages than low-productivity firms and thus contribute to between-firm wage equality. Given that Card et al. (2018) document large differences in average rent-sharing elasticities that have been reported in the literature across different countries and dataset (varying between 0.03 and 0.29), the above back-of-the-envelope calculations show that reasonably small differences in rent-sharing elasticities can create a between-firm-wageinequality-moderating effect of labor market power, as long as there are other sources of firm wage differences that can be compensated by such labor market power differences (e.g. due to differences in workforce compositions between firms).  \n\nThis argument can readily be extended to differences in labor supply elasticities as estimated in the literature on monopsonistic firm labor market power using a standard monopsonistic labor market model.  \n\n#### Appendix C: Estimating the production function  \n\nThe following approach is closely in line with Mertens (2020a, 2020b) and follows the established work of Olley & Pakes (1996), Wooldridge (2009), and De Loecker et al. (2016). The general form of the translog production I apply writes:  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\pmb{\\phi}_{i t}^{\\prime}\\pmb{\\beta}+\\omega_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nLower case letters denote logs and $\\phi_{i t}^{\\prime}$ captures the production inputs $K_{i t},L_{i t}$ , and $M_{i t}$ and its interactions.35 $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ is an i.i.d. error term and $\\omega_{i t}$ denotes Hicks-neutral productivity and follows a Markov process. Whereas $\\omega_{i t}$ is unobserved to the econometrician, firms know $\\omega_{i t}$ before making their input decisions for flexible inputs (i.e. intermediates in my case). As noted in the main text, I assume that only firms? input decision for intermediates depends on productivity shocks. Labor and capital do not respond to contemporary productivity shocks and are thus quasi-fixed inputs.  \n\nAs mentioned in the main text, there are three issues preventing me from directly estimating the production function (C.1) with OLS:  \n\ni.) Although I observe product quantities, I cannot aggregate quantities across the various products of multi-product firms. Yet, I need to estimate a quantity-based production model to recover the relevant output elasticities. Relying on the standard practice to apply sector-specific output deflators does not solve this issue if output prices vary within industries.  \n\ni.)  I do not observe firm-specific input prices for capital and intermediate inputs (I observe only output prices). If input prices are correlated with input decisions and output levels, I face an endogeneity issue.   \ni.) The facts that productivity is unobserved and that firms’ intermediate input decisions depend on productivity shocks create another endogeneity problem.  \n\nBelow, I show how I address these problems and how this leads to equation (12) of the main text.  \n\nSolving issue 1: Deriving a firm-specific price index for firms’ output  \n\nAs it is impossible to aggregate output quantities across the different products of a firm, I construct a firm-specific price index from observed output price information following Eslava, Haltiwanger, Kugler, & Kugler (2004). I use this price index to purged observed firm revenue (for single- and multi-product firms) from price variation by deflating firm revenues with this price index.36 Specifically, I construct firm-specific Tornqvist price indices for each firm's composite revenue from its various products:  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{i t}=\\prod_{g=1}^{n}\\left({\\frac{p_{i g t}}{p_{i g t-1}}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}(s h a r e_{i g t}+s h a r e_{i g t-1})}\\pi_{i t-1}.\n$$  \n\n$\\pi_{i t}$ denotes the price index, $p_{i g t}$ is the price of good $g$ , and $s h a r e_{i g t}$ is the share of this good in total product market sales of firm $i$ in period $t$ . Hence, the growth of the index value is the product of the individual products′ price growths, each weighted with the average sales share of that product over the current and the last year. I define the first year available in the data as the base year, i.e. $\\pi_{t=1995}=100$ . For firms entering after 1995, I follow Eslava et al. (2004) in using an industry average of my firm price indices as a starting value.  \n\nSimilarly, I follow Eslava et al. (2004) and impute missing product price growth information in other cases with an average of product price changes within the same industry.37  \n\nAfter deflating firm revenue with this price index, I end up with a quasi-quantity measure of output, for which, with slightly abusing notation, I keep using $q_{i t}$  \n\n#### Solving issue 2: Controlling for unobserved input price variation  \n\nTo control for unobserved input price variation across firms, I follow De Loecker, Goldberg, Khandelwal, Pavcnik (2016) and define a price-control function from firmproduct-level output price information that I add to the production function (C.1):  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\widetilde{\\phi}_{i t}^{\\prime}\\beta+B_{i t}\\big((\\pi_{i t},m s_{i t},G_{i t},D_{i t})\\times\\pmb{\\phi}_{i t}^{c}\\big)+\\omega_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}.\n$$  \n\nComments on the notation are in order. $B_{i t}(.)=B_{i t}{\\big(}(\\pi_{i t},m s_{i t},G_{i t},D_{i t})\\times\\pmb{\\phi}_{i t}^{c}{\\big)}$ is a price control function consisting of the firm-specific output price index $(\\pi_{i t})$ , a weighted average of firms’ product market shares in terms of revenues $(m s_{i t})$ , a headquarter location dummy $(G_{i t})$ and a four-digit industry dummy $(D_{i t})$ $\\pmb{\\phi}_{i t}^{c}=\\{1;\\widetilde{\\pmb{\\phi}}_{i t}\\}$ ,where $\\widetilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ includes the same input terms as $\\phi_{i t}$ , either in monetary terms and deflated by an industry-level deflator (capital and intermediates) or already reported in quantities (i.e. labor). The tilde indicates that some variables in $\\widetilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ are not expressed in true quantities. The constant entering $\\phi_{i t}^{c}$ highlights that elements of $B(.)$ enter the price control function linearly and interacted with $\\widetilde{\\phi}_{i t}$ (a consequence of the translog production function).  \n\nThe idea behind the price-control function $B(.)$ is that output prices, product market shares, firm location, and firms’ industry affiliation are informative about input prices of firms. Particularly, I assume that product prices and market shares contain information about product quality and that producing high-quality products demands expensive high-quality inputs. As discussed in De Loecker et al. (2016), this motivates to add a control function containing output price and market share information to the right-hand side of the production function to control for unobserved input price variation emerging form input quality differences across firms. Additionally, I include location and four-digit industry dummies into $B(.)$ to absorb remaining differences in local and four-digit industry-specific input prices. Conditional on elements in $B(.)$ , I assume that there are no remaining input price differences across firms.38 Although being restrictive, this assumption is more general than the ones employed in most other studies that estimate production functions without having access to firm-specific price data and which implicitly assume that firms face identical input and output prices within industries.  \n\nA notable difference between the original approach of De Loecker et al. (2016) and the one I apply is that De Loecker et al. (2016) estimate product-level production functions, whereas I transfer their framework to the firm-level. To do so, I use firm-product-specific sales shares in firms’ total product market sales to aggregate firm-product-level information to the firm-level. By doing so, I assume that i) such firm aggregates of product quality increase in firm aggregates of product prices and input quality, i) firm-level input costs for inputs entering as deflated expenditures are increasing in firm-level input quality, and ii) product price elasticities are equal across the various products of a firm. These assumptions, or even stricter versions of them, are always implicitly invoked when estimating firminstead of product-level production functions.  \n\nFinally, note that even if some of the above assumptions do not hold, including the price control function is still preferable to omitting it. This is because the price control function can still absorb some of the unobserved price variation and does not demand that input prices vary between firms with respect to all elements of $B_{i t}(.)$ . The estimation can regularly result in coefficients implying that there is no price variation at all. The attractiveness of a price control function lies in its agnostic view about existence and degree of input price variation.  \n\n#### Solving issue 3: Controlling for unobserved productivity  \n\nTo address the dependence of firms? flexible input decision on unobserved productivity, I employ a control function approach in the spirit of Olley & Pakes (1996). I base my control function on firms’ consumption of energy and raw materials, which I denote both with $e_{i t}$ and which are components of total intermediate inputs. Inverting the demand function for $e_{i t}$ gives an expression for productivity:  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{i t}\\equiv g_{i t}(.)=g_{i t}(e_{i t},k_{i t},l_{i t},\\Gamma_{i t}),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Gamma_{i t}$ captures state variables of the firm, that in addition to $k_{i t}$ and $l_{i t}$ affect firms demand for $e_{i t}$ . Ideally, $\\Gamma_{i t}$ should include a broad set of variables affecting productivity and demand for $e_{i t}$ . In my specification, I include dummy variables for export $(E X_{i t})$ activities, the log of the number of products a firm produces $(N u m P_{i t})$ and the average wage it pays $(w_{i t})$ into $\\Gamma_{i t}$ . The latter absorbs unobserved quality and price differences that shift demand for $e_{i t}$ , which accounts for the criticism of Gandhi, Navarro, & Rivers (2020) (see also De Loecker & Scott (2016).  \n\nRecap that productivity follows a first order Markov process. I allow that firms can shift this Markov process, giving rise to the following law of motion for productivity: $\\omega_{i t}=$ $h_{i t}(\\omega_{i t-1},T_{i t-1})+\\xi_{i t}=h_{i t}(.)+\\xi_{i t}$ ,where $\\xi_{i t}$ denotes the innovation in productivity and $\\pmb{T}_{i t}=(E X_{i t},N u m P_{i t})$ reflects  that I allow  for learning effects  from  export market participation and (dis)economies of scope through adding and dropping products to influence firm productivity.39 Plugging (C.4) and the law of motion for productivity into (C.3) gives:  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\widetilde{\\pmb{\\phi}}_{i t}^{\\prime}\\pmb{\\beta}+B_{i t}(.)+h_{i t}(.)+\\varepsilon_{i t}+\\xi_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhich constitutes the basis of my estimation and is identical to equation (12) of the main text.  \n\n#### Identifying moments  \n\nI estimate equation (12) separately by two-digit NACE rev. 1.1 industries using a one-step estimator as in Wooldridge (2009).40 This estimator uses lagged values of flexible inputs (i.e. intermediates) as instruments for their contemporary values to address the dependence of firms’ flexible input decisions on realizations of $\\xi_{i t}$ . Similarly, I use lagged values of terms including firms’ market share and output price index as instruments for their contemporary values as I consider these to be flexible variables.41 I define identifying moments jointly on $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ and $\\xi_{i t}$  \n\n$$\nE\\big((\\varepsilon_{i t}+\\xi_{i t})\\Upsilon_{i t}\\big)=0,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{Y}}_{i t}$ includes lagged interactions of intermediate inputs with labor and capital, contemporary interactions of labor and capital, contemporary location and industry  \n\ndummies, the lagged output price index, lagged market shares, lagged elements of $h_{i t}(.)$ and lagged interactions of the output price index with production inputs. Formally this implies:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Y}_{i t}^{\\prime}=(J_{i t}(.),A_{i t-1}(.),T_{i t-1}(.),\\Psi_{i t}(.),\\nu_{i t-1}),\n$$  \n\nwhere for convenience I defined:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{J_{i t}(.)=(l_{i t},k_{i t},l_{i t}^{2},k_{i t}^{2},l_{i t}k_{i t},G_{i t},D_{i t}),}\\ &{A_{i t}(.)=(m_{i t},m_{i t}^{2},l_{i t}m_{i t},k_{i t}m_{i t},l_{i t}k_{i t}m_{i t},m s_{i t},\\pi_{i t}),}\\ &{T_{i t}(.)=\\bigg((l_{i t},k_{i t},l_{i t}^{2},k_{i t}^{2},l_{i t}k_{i t},m_{i t},m_{i t}^{2},l_{i t}m_{i t},k_{i t}m_{i t},l_{i t}k_{i t}m_{i t})\\times\\pi_{i t}\\bigg),}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{\\Psi_{i t}(.)=\\sum_{n=0}^{3}\\sum_{w=0}^{3-b}\\sum_{h=0}^{3-n-b}l_{i t-1}^{n}k_{i t-1}^{b}e_{i t-1}^{h}}\\end{array}$ , and  \n\n$$\n\\nu_{i t-1}=(E x p_{i t-1},N u m P_{i t-1},w_{i t-1}),\n$$  \n\nwith $w_{i t}$ denoting the average wage a firm pays.42  \n\n#### Results  \n\nTable C.1 and C.2 show median and average output elasticities.43 In total, I can compute output elasticities for 248,400 firms. Median (mean) output elasticities across all industries equal 0.63 (0.64) 0.30 (0.30) 0.11 (0.11) for intermediates, labor, and capital inputs, respectively.  \n\nFor 5,418 firms in the data, I estimate negative output elasticities. As negative output elasticities are inconsistent with the production model I assume, I drop these firms from the further analysis.  \n\nTABLE C.1   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">PRODUCTIONFUNCTIONESTIMATION: MEDIANOUTPUTELASTICITIES,BYSECTOR</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Number of observations</td><td>Intermediate inputs</td><td>Labor</td><td>Capital</td><td>Returns to scale</td></tr><tr><td>Sector</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td>15 Food products and beverages</td><td>29,874</td><td>0.66</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.95</td></tr><tr><td>17 Textiles</td><td>8,618</td><td>0.67</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.17</td><td>1.14</td></tr><tr><td>18 Apparel, dressing, and dyeing of fur</td><td>3,236</td><td>0.73</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.12</td><td>1.05</td></tr><tr><td>19 Leather and leather products</td><td>1,923</td><td>0.65</td><td>0.27</td><td>0.14</td><td>1.09</td></tr><tr><td>20 Wood and wood products</td><td>7,229</td><td>0.66</td><td>0.23</td><td>0.09</td><td>0.99</td></tr><tr><td>21 Pulp, paper, and paper products</td><td>7,115</td><td>0.69</td><td>0.27</td><td>0.09</td><td>1.05</td></tr><tr><td>22 Publishing and printing</td><td>5,967</td><td>0.57</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.08</td><td>0.88</td></tr><tr><td>24 Chemicals and chemical products</td><td>15,155</td><td>0.69</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.12</td><td>1.09</td></tr><tr><td>25 Rubber and plastic products</td><td>15,909</td><td>0.66</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.99</td></tr><tr><td>26 Other non-metallic mineral products</td><td>13,612</td><td>0.62</td><td>0.29</td><td>0.13</td><td>1.07</td></tr><tr><td>27 Basic metals</td><td>10,178</td><td>0.66</td><td>0.34</td><td>0.06</td><td>1.06</td></tr><tr><td>28 Fabricated metal products</td><td>32,866</td><td>0.60 0.62</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.09 0.10</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>29 Machinery and equipment</td><td>40,169</td><td>0.62</td><td>0.37 0.33</td><td>0.13</td><td>1.08</td></tr><tr><td>30 Electrical and optical equipment</td><td>1,984 14,833</td><td>0.63</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.11</td><td>1.09</td></tr><tr><td>31 Electrical machinery and apparatus</td><td>4,380</td><td>0.60</td><td>0.39</td><td>0.13</td><td>1.04</td></tr><tr><td>32 Radio,television,and communication</td><td>10,534</td><td>0.57</td><td>0.37</td><td>0.14</td><td>1.10</td></tr><tr><td>33 Medical and precision instruments</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.10</td><td>1.09</td></tr><tr><td>34Motorvehicles and trailers</td><td>8,815 3,894</td><td>0.68 0.62</td><td>0.32 0.31</td><td>0.02</td><td>1.07</td></tr><tr><td>35 Transport equipment</td><td>12,109</td><td>0.65</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.14</td><td>0.96</td></tr><tr><td>36 Furniture manufacturing</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1.09</td></tr><tr><td>Across all industries</td><td>248,400</td><td>0.63</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.11</td><td>1.04</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table C.1 reports median output elasticities calculated after estimating the production function (C.5) for every NACE rev. 1.1 two-digit industry with sufficient observations.

Having calculated this depreciation rate, one can use a perpetual inventory method to calculate a capital stock series for every firm in the data:  \n\n$$\nK_{i t}=K_{i t-1}\\big(1-\\alpha_{j t-1}\\big)+I_{i t-1}.\n$$  \n\n$K_{i t},\\alpha_{j t}$ ,and $I_{i t}$ respectively denote the capital stock, the depreciation rate of capital in industry $j$ and investment. I will now explain how to derive an expression for $\\alpha_{j t}$  \n\nThe statistical office of Germany supplies information on the expected lifetime of capital goods bought in period $t$ , separately for buildings and equipment. As everything what follows is equivalent for both types of capital goods, let us abstract from different capital good types and denote the expected lifetime of any capital good bought in period $t$ simplyby $D_{t}$ . Let us further assume that the depreciation rate of a capital good stays constant throughout its lifetime. Hence, the average (or expected) lifetime of a capital stock bought in period $t=0$ can be defined as:  \n\n$$\nD_{0}=\\frac{1}{K_{0}}\\sum_{0}^{\\infty}(\\alpha K_{t})t,\n$$  \n\nwhere the sum is taken over all periods $t,\\alpha K_{t}$ denotes the amount of depreciated capital in period $t$ . Assuming a linear capital depreciation, consistent with (I.1), implies: $K_{t}=$ $K_{0}(1-\\delta_{0})^{t}$ . Substituting this into (I.2) and switching to continuous time gives:  \n\n$$\nD_{0}=\\frac{1}{K_{0}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}(\\alpha K_{0}(1-\\alpha)^{t})t d t.\n$$  \n\nAfter rearranging we have:  \n\n$$\nD_{0}=\\alpha\\int_{0}^{\\infty}(1-\\alpha)^{t}t d t.\n$$  \n\nPartial integration gives:  \n\n$$\nD_{0}=\\alpha\\left[\\frac{(1-\\alpha)^{t}}{\\ln(1-\\alpha)}t\\right]_{0}^{\\infty}-\\:\\alpha\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(1-\\alpha)^{t}}{\\ln(1-\\alpha)}d t.\n$$  \n\nNote that the first term on the right-hand side of (I.5) equals zero because $0<\\alpha<1$ Integrating the remaining expression gives:  \n\n$$\nD_{0}=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\ln(1-\\alpha)*\\ln{(1-\\alpha)}}.\n$$  \n\nGiven that the expected lifetime, $D_{0}$ , is known, (I.6) can be solved numerically.  \n\nRecap that the statistical office reports the expected lifetime of capital goods separately for buildings and equipment. Hence, I calculate a separate depreciation rate for each of those capital good types. To receive a single industry-specific depreciation rate, I weight the depreciation rates for buildings and equipment respectively with the industry-level share of building capital in total capital and equipment capital in total capital and sum up (this information is also supplied by the statistical office). For the practical implementation, I assume that the depreciation rate of a firm's whole capital stock equals the depreciation rate of newly purchased capital. Thus, for every industry and year I compute:  \n\n$$\n\\alpha_{j t}=\\alpha_{j t}^{B u i l d}\\frac{K_{j t}^{B u i l d}}{K_{j t}}+\\alpha_{j t}^{E q u i p}\\frac{K_{j t}^{E q u i p}}{K_{j t}},\n$$  \n\nwhere the superscript indicates whether the variable refers to a building or equipment specific variable. $K_{j t}^{B u i l d},K_{j t}^{E q u i p}$ , and $K_{j t}=K_{j t}^{B u i l d}+K_{j t}^{E q u i p}$ respectively denote the total building capital stock, the total equipment capital stock, and the total capital stock of industry $j$ in period $t$ .Having calculated this depreciation rate, I use equation (I.1） to calculate firm-specific capital series.  \n\nTo calculate the first capital stock of every capital series, I divide the reported tax depreciation (given in my data) by the depreciation rate. I do not use the tax depreciation variable in my law of motion because reported tax depreciations vary due to state induced tax incentives and, therefore, do not necessary reflect the true amount of depreciated capital (e.g. House & Shapiro (2008)). Given that firms likely report too high values of depreciated capital due to such incentives, the first capital stock in each of my capital series is likely an overestimate of the true capital stock used in the firm's production activities. Over longer periods, however, observed investment decisions gradually receive a larger weight in the estimated capital stocks. This mitigates the impact of the first capital stock over time. Given that I estimate very reasonable output elasticities for capital (see the online Appendix C), I am confident that my capital variables reliably reflect firms true capital stocks.4  \n\n#### Appendix E: Core results using a constant and time-varying Cobb-Douglas production model  \n\n#### Appendix E.1: Time-constant Cobb-Douglas specification  \n\nThis section replicates core results using a simple Cobb-Douglas production model with industry-specific and time constant output elasticities. The key insight from this replication is that all my results are robust to using this alternative production.  \n\n#### The Cobb-Douglas production model  \n\nThe estimation routine of the Cobb-Douglas production model closely follows the procedure described in the online Appendix C. The only differences are that i) I omit the translog interactions and higher order terms of production inputs captured in $\\phi_{i t}^{\\prime}$ and ii) the price control function $B_{i t}(.)$ now contains no interaction between production inputs and any other element of $B_{i t}(.)$ , which follows from the Cobb-Douglas structure (see De Loecker et al. (2016)). Formally, the Cobb-Douglas production model I take to the data is:  \n\n$$\nq_{i t}=\\theta^{L}l_{i t}+\\theta^{M}m_{i t}+\\theta^{K}k_{i t}+B_{i t}(.)+h_{i t}(.)+\\xi_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $B_{i t}(.)=B_{i t}(\\pi_{i t},m s_{i t},G_{i t},D_{i t})$ and the notation is consistent with the online Appendix　 C. As　 in　 the　 online　 Appendix　 C, I　 approximate $h_{i t}(.)=$ $h_{i t}(e_{i t-1},k_{i t-1},l_{i t-1},E X_{i t-1},N u m P_{i t-1},w_{i t-1})$ with a third order polynomial in $e_{i t-1},k_{i t-1}$ ， and, $l_{i t-1}$ and add $E X_{i t-1},N u m P_{i t-1}$ , and $w_{i t-1}$ linearly. In line with the translog-model described in online Appendix C, the identifying moments are based on variables that enter $h_{i t}(.)$ as lagged values, lagged values of $m s_{i t}$ and $\\pi_{i t}$ ， contemporary values of $G_{i t}$ and $D_{i t}$ , contemporary values of $k_{i t}$ and $l_{i t}$ , and the lagged value of mit·  \n\nFigure E.1 shows the cross-sectional dispersion of wages and marginal revenue products of labor.

I still estimate the production function separately for each two-digit-industries. Additionally, I estimate the industry-specific production functions now also separately for moving 5-year intervals. I then place the estimates in the middle-year of each interval. The first estimation step takes the years 1995-1999 and estimates coefficients for 1997, the second step takes the years 1996-2000 and estimates coefficients for 1998 and so on. As consequence, I drop the first and last two years of the sample. Yet, this time-varying specification is much more flexible and accounts for biased-technological change that might bias my baseline estimates. As shown below, all my results hold also for this alternative production model.  \n\nKey results using the time-varying translog model  \n\nFigure E.4 shows the cross-sectional dispersion of wages and marginal revenue products of labor.

This is because labor market power is defined as the ratio between wages and marginal revenue products of labor. Hence, even if wages and marginal revenue products of labor would grow proportionally (and labor market power would stay constant), the total Euro level of rents would increase for a given percentage wedge between wages and marginal revenue products of labor (i.e. for a given level of labor market power). Moreover, starting from a high level of firm-side labor market power, even a decrease in firm-side labor market power can lead to an increase in total labor market rents of firms (i.e. an increase in the Euro level of rents), if wages and marginal revenue products of labor grow sufficiently strong.  \n\nIn contrast and as I show below in Table F.1, product market power levels of these top firms, although increasing, stay on, compared to labor market power, much lower levels. Hence, also over time, top firms generate particularly high rents on labor markets, while being active on comparably competitive product markets.  \n\nTABLE F.1   \nAVERAGE PRODUCT AND LABOR MARKET POWER FOR HIGH WAGE, LARGE, AND HIGHMRPLFIRMS, OVERTIME   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"3\">Product market power</td><td colspan=\"3\">Labor market power</td></tr><tr><td>High-wage firms</td><td>Large firms</td><td>High-MRPL firms</td><td>High-wage firms (4)</td><td>Large firms (5)</td><td>High-MRPL firms (6)</td></tr><tr><td>Year 1995</td><td>(1) 1.08</td><td>(2) 0.99</td><td>(3) 0.94</td><td>1.13</td><td>1.55</td><td>2.10</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>1.10</td><td>1.01</td><td>0.94</td><td>1.07</td><td>1.48</td><td>2.03</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>1.09</td><td>1.01</td><td>0.95</td><td>1.13</td><td>1.51</td><td>2.06</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>1.10</td><td>1.01</td><td>0.95</td><td>1.14</td><td>1.53</td><td>2.07</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>1.12</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.96</td><td>1.08</td><td>1.48</td><td>2.07</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>1.11</td><td>1.02</td><td>0.96</td><td>1.13</td><td>1.57</td><td>2.15</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>1.10</td><td>1.01</td><td>0.96</td><td>1.15</td><td>1.59</td><td>2.15</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>1.10</td><td>1.02</td><td>0.96</td><td>1.15</td><td>1.54</td><td>2.07</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>1.11</td><td>1.02</td><td>0.96</td><td>1.12</td><td>1.52</td><td>2.11</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>1.11</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.98</td><td>1.16</td><td>1.57</td><td>2.14</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>1.13</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.97</td><td>1.18</td><td>1.61</td><td>2.23</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>1.10</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.98</td><td>1.30</td><td>1.67</td><td>2.35</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>1.13</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.98</td><td>1.30</td><td>1.72</td><td>2.49</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>1.12</td><td>1.02</td><td>0.97</td><td>1.32</td><td>1.72</td><td>2.49</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>1.09</td><td>1.01</td><td>0.95</td><td>1.20</td><td>1.53</td><td>2.24</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1.12</td><td>1.04</td><td>0.97</td><td>1.26</td><td>1.60</td><td>2.36</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1.13</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.97</td><td>1.31</td><td>1.73</td><td>2.53</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1.12</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.97</td><td>1.29</td><td>1.64</td><td>2.44</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1.11</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.97</td><td>1.29</td><td>1.58</td><td>2.34</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1.12</td><td>1.04</td><td>0.98</td><td>1.25</td><td>1.56</td><td>2.29</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1.12</td><td>1.06</td><td>0.98</td><td>1.24</td><td>1.54</td><td>2.23</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1.14</td><td>1.07</td><td>1.00</td><td>1.23</td><td>1.52</td><td>2.15</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: Table F.1 reports average product and labor market power levels for high-wage, large, and high-MRPL firms.
