Being a book about the production process, it also tackles some of the key issues found in the academic literature on the theory of the firm. This literature is rooted in studies of manufacturing firms in the heartland of the English Industrial Revolution. In many respects, given their interest in the underlying principles framing the organization of firms and in situating firms in context, Adam Smith and Alfred Marshall were both economists and economic geographers. During the twentieth century, the academic literature on the theory of the firm brought into focus industrial corporations and then the management revolution that resulted in re-engineering integrated corporations through intermediation as found in supply chains and global production networks.  \n\nOur book shares with other treatments of the modern corporation an abiding interest in the management and organization of the production process. In our case, we focus on the global financial services industry, where the building blocks underpinning the study of industrial corporations are less relevant. In fact, they can be blind alleys when seeking to understand the organization of the production process and its results as expressed in global financial markets. One of the goals of our book is to explain how and why the production of investment returns differs from that of manufactured goods. Another is to provide an analytical framework that situates financial institutions within the complex web of the intermediaries that dominate developed financial markets. As such, the book is more than an analysis of the organization and management of institutional investors; it is also an analysis of the global financial services industry.  \n\nWe came to the topic after having been involved in a variety of projects that dealt with the role of endowments, insurance companies, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds in global financial markets. Over the past couple of decades, we have come to realize that these types of organizations deserve more recognition in the academic literature and, perhaps obviously, a degree of engagement that can allow us to understand better how and why they do what they do. As a result, our approach begins with the organization and management of these institutions rather than with their place in the structure and performance of global financial markets. In doing so, we share with Coase (1992) and Davis (2015) an interest in what might be referred to as the 'substance' of firms and markets. In other words, we work from the inside of financial institutions to the outside, instead of imposing the theories of modern management studies and microeconomics on them. Nonetheless, we take seriously the imperatives driving global financial markets in home jurisdictions and offshore. We could hardly do otherwise.  \n\nIn developing our project, we have been privileged to work with many individuals and organizations in the global financial services industry. In our acknowledgements, we give heartfelt thanks to those who have taken us inside the industry. Like other academics able to report on what they observe in firms and industries, we recognize that being privileged in this manner carries with it certain obligations. Most obviously, we set aside detailed knowledge of specific organizations to report on the logics or analytical principles that give shape to an institutional investor and its place in the global financial services industry. As importantly, we explain the interaction between institutions and financial markets with reference to the management of the production process rather than to the theory of financial market performance and structure.  \n\nOne thing we have learnt from writing up our research is that it is too easy to idealize the management and organization of institutional investors. Had we chosen simplicity and parsimony as the guiding principles underpinning our analytical framework, we would have risked allowing abstract logic to submerge the analysis instead of giving pride of place to the complex interplay between manager authority and the domain-specific skills and expertise of investment managers. We have tried as much as possible to walk a fine line between analytical logic and the messy world of organizations, the apparent competition for authority in them and the necessary compromises that any organization must make if it is to reconcile the competing claims of interest inside and outside its jurisdiction. In writing the book, we have been mindful of what has gone on before, especially in organization theory and in the theory of the firm. Here, then, is an opportunity to read our book, which we have located at the intersection between the works of Coase, March and Simon, Marris, and related theorists of organization and contract theory, as well as between Williamson's transaction cost economics and scholars like Bathelt and Gluckler, who emphasize relationships over formal contracts.  \n\n## Acknowledgements  \n\nThis book was made possible by the support of numerous organizations and we would, in particular, like to acknowledge that of our home institutions. For Gordon Clark, these are the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, the Said Business School at Oxford University and, further afield, the Department of Banking and Finance in the Monash Business School at Monash University. For Ashby Monk, they are the Global Projects Center (GPC) in the Faculty of Engineering at Stanford University, and the Regents of the University of California. Without the administrative and organizational support of our home institutions and, in particular, the editorial support of Alice Chautard, Angelika Kaiser, and Jennifer Sabourin, this book would have never seen the light of day.  \n\nWhen developing a research programme based on in-depth knowledge of the life of institutions and organizations, any researcher relies on whatever access, information, and insights these organizations can offer. We were privileged to have been taken into a wide range of investment institutions around the world, including endowments, family offces, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds. It would be invidious to pick out specific organizations and individuals while leaving others unidentified. We can, however, acknowledge the open door provided to us by the Swedish government through its review of the AP funds to which we contributed. We would like to thank the panel for its interest in our ideas and members of the enquiry staff, including Mats Langensjo and Asa Sterte.  \n\nCloser to home, we would like to thank Roger Urwin from Willis Towers Watson for his insights into pension fund governance and investment management. He is one of the stars in the field and it is difficult to imagine how we could have become involved in these issues without his help and advice. He was also heavily involved in the formulation of Chapter 9 of this book; we are grateful for his willingness to share his ideas, resources, and key informants. We are also conscious of the help provided by many other industry advisers and executives over the past decade or so, including Keith Ambachtsheer, Jagdeep Singh Bachher, Mark Burgess, Peter Curtis, John Evans, Don Ezra, Eduard van Gelderen, Divyesh Hindocha, Heribert Karch, Mike Orszag, Nick Sykes, and John Whiteman. Along the way, we have also benefited from collaborating with industry groups such Allianz Global Investors (Elizabeth Corley), Arabesque Asset Management (Omar Sharif), Conexus (Amanda White), and Pensions e Investments (Chris Battaglia), as well as EuroMoney Institutional Investor (Diane Alfano, Scott Kalb, and Michael Peltz) and participants in the GPC's research club.  \n\nThis book began life through two related projects. Keith Ambachtsheer of the Rotman School of Management's International Centre for Pension Management (ICPM) at the University of Toronto sponsored one on the governance and management of pension reserve funds. He has followed our research with interest, provided encouragement, and underwritten the significance of what we have sought to achieve. The other project to underpin this particular book, which the Leverhulme Trust sponsored, was on the governance, management, and legitimacy of sovereign wealth funds. The Leverhulme Trust also funded the book that resulted from it, which involved a number of our colleagues, including Adam Dixon. In combination, these two projects gave us the opportunity to scour the world and talk to investment organizations, sponsors, intermediaries, and governments.  \n\nWe have also been fortunate in being able to present our research at academic forums, industry conferences, various institutions' board and senior executive meetings, government-sponsored enquiries, and various roundtables convened by interested groups. We were able to test out our ideas, hear people's comments on them, and, over time, refine and then further refine our central message. We have relied on the support, ideas, and critical comments of many academic colleagues, notably Harald Bathelt, Christine Brown, Adam Dixon, Sabine Dorry, Dorothee Franzen, Eric Knight, Ray Levitt, Phillip O'Neill, Debra Ralston, W. Richard Scott, Rajiv Sharma, and Dariusz Wojcik. Most importantly, Sarah McGill provided key insights, argument, and enthusiasm during the latter stages of the project, which involved translating ideas into this book. Without our colleagues? support and advice, we would have been unable to develop the project in all its dimensions.  \n\nAlong the way, we published a number of articles on the project, some of which formed the basis of chapters developed in this book. For permissions to use material from our work previously published in their journals, we therefore thank the following:  \n\nPion Ltd— “Financial institutions, information, and investing-at-a-distance', Environment and Planning A (2013) 45: 1318-36; and “The geography of investment management contracts: The UK, Europe, and the global financial services industry, Environment and Planning A (2014) 46: 531-49.  \n\nOxford University Press- ‘The scope of financial institutions: In-sourcing. outsourcing and off-shoring, Journal of Economic Geography (2013) 13: 279-98.  \n\nRegional Studies Association—‘State and local pension fund governance and the process of contracting for investment services: The scope of diversity and the problem of embeddedness', Territory, Politics, and Governance (2014) 2:150-72.  \n\nAssociation of American Geographers—“The production of investment returns in spatially extensive markets', The Professional Geographer (2015) 67:595-607.  \n\nTaylor and Francis—“Information, knowledge, and investing in offshore markets', Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment (2014) 4: 299-320.  \n\nSage—^Ambiguity, contract and innovation in financial institutions', Competition and Change (2016) 20: 187-203.  \n\nInstitutional Investor Journals—‘The outsourced chief investment officer model of management and the principal-agent problem', Journal of Retirement (2017) 4(3).  \n\nSince we have relied on research sponsors for engagement and funding-- some of which are commercial entities—we declare that this book neither serves the interests of any specific commercial party nor has provided the authors with any direct financial benefit.  \n\nFinally, any long-running project such as this incurs many debtsspecifically the patience of our families and friends. We are grateful that Shirley and Courtney, and Henry and Bea, have given life to our personal and professional commitments. Likewise, we are very grateful for the help and support that Peter B. Clark provided in getting us to be more serious about what we can learn from institutions and how we might frame the conversation in ways that can promote institutions' long-term development.  \n\nGordon L.

Throughout the book, we work at different levels, looking at institutional investment vehicles (endowments, family offices, insurance companies, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds), the intermediaries who serve them, and the asset managers of commercial organizations who often place assets in global financial markets. We know more about asset managers than about asset owners. Nonetheless, in many respects, asset owners deserve pride of place in any analysis of financial market structures and their performance, for they are the clients, whereas intermediaries like asset managers provide services to realize their clients goals and objectives. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of the role and significance of institutional investors. We begin with asset owners and extend our discussion to asset managers.  \n\nIt is widely acknowledged that institutional investors underpin the structure and performance of global financial markets. Whereas arguments are made for and against viewing their investment strategies in terms of long-term commitments as opposed to short-term opportunism—witness the UK Kay Review (Kay 2012)—there is no doubt that the growth of institutional investors over the past fifty years has given global financial markets a remarkable depth of liquidity and scope of activities. At the same time, institutional investors rely heavily on financial markets to frame and implement their investment strategies. Therefore, it is important to understand what is distinctive about this environment compared with other industry environments, especially manufacturing. In this chapter, we explain the significance of financial risk and uncertainty in the production of investment returns and provide a brief overview of what can be termed the map of financial risk and uncertainty.  \n\nIn subsequent chapters, these issues are developed in more detail using conceptual building blocks from economics, economic geography, and finance. In this chapter, we also provide a brief overview of our research methods and mode of exposition. In short, we deliver a stylized representation of institutional investment, the relationships between institutional investors and intermediaries, and the logic and principles underpinning the production of investment returns. We hardly ever refer to specific institutions or organizations. It is worth noting that in Chapter 2 we not only directly tackle the conceptual status of institutions and organizations, but also provide a rationale for our use of terms. Meanwhile, however, we shall use the terms as they are used in the industry, among regulators, and in a number of academic disciplines. Institutional investors typically have a distinctive legal status, whereas organizations can be thought of as assemblages of people and resources collected together to realize certain objectives.  \n\n# INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS  \n\nInstitutional investors are a key component of modern economies; they mobilize savings to invest in traded and untraded securities (Davis and Steil 2001). In many cases, they are portfolio investors, as opposed to direct investors who are willing and able to apply their considerable resources to a specific investment facility or option in which they own a majority or controlling stake. Much has been written about the significance of institutional investors for global stock markets, for they are the people who map the flows of assets around the world in relation to opportunities at home and abroad. Likewise, considerable academic research has focused on the role of institutional investors in facilitating global financial integration. There was a time, not so long ago, when it was meaningful to suggest that global financial integration would be so profound that the investment and risk management activities of institutional investors would come up with an organizational framework able to place assets around the world against an unproblematic metric of risk and return, thus replacing both space and time.  \n\nNotwithstanding the rhetoric accompanying the ^end of geography', institutional investors have learnt to deal with a world best understood as a patchwork of heterogeneous expectations, rules, and regulations rather than an undifferentiated surface of investment opportunities (cf. O'Brien 1992). Moreover, institutional investors normally maintain a continuing commitment to invest in their home jurisdictions. Investment is typically anchored in the origin of the funds under management and in the immediate opportunities for investment available in home markets. In part, the intimate connection between the origin of funds and their investment destinations reflects the fact that, as the volume of funds grew in the Anglo-American world over the middle and later years of the twentieth century, the inflow of funds to financial markets reinforced the significance of these markets for their nation-states and beyond. If we add the global economic success of Japan in the decades immediately after the Second World War, this gives us three global markets—Tokyo, London, and New York--which became the switch points for flows of financial assets around theworld.  \n\nAs these markets grew in significance over the second half of the twentieth century, memories of the financial crises of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries faded to be replaced by growing confidence in the stability of these financial markets, especially compared with the margins of the world (for example, Asia and Latin America). Underpinning the emerging hegemony of these markets was an intellectual programme that sought to formalize and systematize investment norms and conventions into an overarching set of rules for investment. This movement has been described in many ways (see Bernstein's 1996 treatment of risk management). Modern portfolio theory (MPT), followed by the ready acceptance of the Sharpe ratio, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), the Black-Scholes theorem, and much else besides, all played a part in the emerging paradigm of investment theory and practice. This paradigm was so significant that it drove a wedge between the primarily asset-owning institutional investors who acted on behalf of others, including beneficiaries, and the asset managers who provided the capabilities and resources necessary to realize the benefits of modern investment theory.  \n\nIt was widely accepted that best-practice investment management was to be attained through intermediation. Here, asset owners, such as pension funds, endowments, and foundations, would contract out the strategic and tactical investment decision-making (along with the investment of assets) to assetand style-specific investment managers. At the limit, the investment-related activities of asset owners were conceived and implemented through a network of service providers whose contracts were notionally performance related but were, in fact, more often based on convenience and past commitment than on a long-term value proposition. In time, risk management via portfolio diversification was extended to service provision, with the result that both large and small asset owners tended to hold numerous providers with overlapping mandates. In the vernacular of the industry, the search for better performance was conducted through “beauty parades'—namely presentations by service providers to fund boards and executives loath to fire incumbent providers. When contracts were standardized, fees normalized and markets grew, everyone became a winner.  \n\nJust as the golden era appeared to have no end in sight, problems were emerging. Harbingers of the future came in different guises. The Asian financial crisis of 1997, while significant for the core markets of the global financial system, was absorbed and the moment of instability explained by reference to something that had happened elsewhere. The failure of long-term capital management (LTCM) in 1998 surprised the market in part because the principals of the fund were so reputable; in this case, a rescue package was quickly put in place and, once again, markets absorbed the costs of instability. The technology, media, telecommunications (TMT) bubble of the first years of the twenty-first century was home grown and represented converging expectations on the promise of technological invention and innovation for sustained high levels of economic growth. Public recognition of the causes and consequences of the bubble were, however, smothered by the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing war on terror. Thereafter, Chinese economic growth masked the softening of the US economy. Just around the corner, however, with the onset of the global financial crisis (GFC) and now the Brexit crisis, the euro crisis profoundly disrupted confidence in the virtues of developed financial markets. It has now become commonplace to speak about the systemic risks apparent in developed markets around the world (Haldane and May 2011).  \n\nSophisticated institutional investors have drawn a variety of lessons from the past twenty years. An obvious one has been that risk management is an essential ingredient in a successful long-term investment strategy and that financial markets do not always price risk in ways that reflect underlying factors. A second lesson has been that risk management through portfolio diversification works well in ‘normal conditions, but may be quite inadequate in extreme conditions when risk management is, in fact, at a premium. A third lesson has been that the interests of asset owners and asset managers are not symmetrical: during good times, when markets are on the rise, both parties benefit from a standard contract, even if relatively poor performance may come at the same cost as relatively good performance. During moments of crisis, when markets are dysfunctional and risk pricing fails, asset owners can lose a large portion of the value of their assets, while asset managers continue to claim fees for an investment performance that is not as bad as that of their competitors. A fourth lesson has been that the size of an institutional investor is no guarantee of superior performance-there is a premium to be had from effective governance and management in crisis conditions not otherwise evident in ‘normal’ conditions (Clark and Urwin2010).  \n\nOur book takes as given the evident tensions between asset owners and their service providers in the aftermath of the GFC and continuing global financial uncertainties. Sources of uncertainty are to be found, for example, in the euro crisis and in the growth prospects of China and emerging markets. At issue is whether the model of intermediation, conceived and put in place in the second half of the twentieth century, is a viable blueprint for institutional investors over the first half of the twenty-first century. We show that one response to recent events has been disintermediation-—-in other words, the paring back of service providers to allow asset owners more control over (and oversight of) the formation and implementation of investment strategy. A related response has been for asset owners to insource the formation and implementation of investment strategy—thereby becoming investors in their own right. Yet another response has been reintermediation—managing the formation and implementation of investment strategy through partnerships and relationships with external providers whose interests and incentives are aligned with those of the asset owners.  \n\nCrucially, our research is framed with reference to institutional investors with long-term commitments, but notwithstanding the ever-present temptation to maximize short-term investment returns. In this regard, we include asset owners like pension funds, endowments, family offices, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, and, on the edge, insurance companies. We do not ignore the issue of short-term returns, but set it in the context of how best to realize long-term objectives through effective investment governance and management. Equally important for our research has been a concern to situate institutional investors in their home markets and in what we term spatially as extensive financial markets. As we show, one of the challenges that institutional investors face when pursuing strategies of disintermediation, insourcing, and reintermediation has been the spatial disconnect between their home bases and national and international financial markets. A related challenge has been to realize the evident opportunities to be found in emerging markets otherwise controlled by global asset managers. In this respect, we place explicit emphasis on time and space for the governance and management of institutional investors wanting to refashion how they manage themselves and their partnerships.  \n\nOur book is about a world being turned upside down--intermediation has become an important political issue and an issue of governance and management. Even so, many asset owners have been around for decades; they are embedded in particular economic and political environments with attendant expectations and constraints on innovation. Few asset owners face competitors over their obligations and responsibilities; in many cases, they have a legal right to represent the interests of ^captive' beneficiaries. Likewise, the largest asset managers tend to dominate the global investment management industry; they absorb competitors when seeking to innovate, while allowing redundant or yet-to-be-proven tasks and functions to be spun off into the market for investment management. We are interested in the leading edge of the investment management industry, the search for organizational innovation and the reconfiguration of existing institutions given what is possible. This book is about how to meet long-term commitments by investing away from an institution's home base in a world increasingly dominated by investment opportunities at a distance from either established institutions or accepted norms and conventions.  \n\nTo frame our analysis, we return to first principles. Most obviously, we explain how and why institutional investors are different from other kinds of organizations—notably those that dominate microeconomic textbooks. This includes consideration of what counts as a productive ^asset' in an investment house. It also includes distinguishing between the tangible assets of plant and equipment used to characterize manufacturing firms, and the intangible assets of human capital, as well as the decision-making protocols and procedures that are so important to investment institutions. Learning is obviously important in both kinds of organizations. Nonetheless, as we show, formal and tacit knowledge in investment houses are contingent on the structure and performance of financial markets and cannot be honed to perfection as is often the case in manufacturing companies. We focus on how investment returns are produced in these types of organizations. We explain the difficulties facing senior managers in promoting innovation in the production of investment returns. Inspired by Coase (1937, 1992) and others interested in the internal logic of economic organizations, we emphasize the organizational logic underpinning the production of investment returns and the ways in which intermediation, disintermediation, and reintermediation may play roles in that process.  \n\n# FINANCIAL RISK AND UNCERTAINTY  \n\nLike other industries, the production of financial services, including investment management, relies on economies of scale and scope within and between markets for financial products. These markets are regional, national, and international in scope, for financial institutions pool dispersed financial assets and liabilities in a handful of global financial centres to reap economies of scale in processing and placement (W6jcik 2011). For many years, insurance companies and pension funds employed external asset managers to produce planned returns through various financial strategies and products. As we show, large asset owners have begun to bring the production of investment returns in-house, partly because of the high costs of intermediation associated with outsourcing. To appreciate our approach to this issue better, in this section we provide a schematic overview of three key factors affecting the production process.  \n\n### Theory and Practice  \n\nThe EMH dominated financial theory and practice for more than a generation. In sum, it stood for the idea that market prices incorporate all available information and thereby sustain rational expectations (Fama 1970, 1991). It justified a presumption in favour of markets in the sense that behaviour inconsistent with rational expectations would be priced accordingly and driven out of the market. In the first instance, behaviourists disputed the EMH by demonstrating the persistence of behaviour at odds with theoretical expectations (Akerlof and Shiller 2009; Shiller 2005). Informed by a research programme led by Kahneman and Tversky (1979), others suggested that the EMH could not account for behavioural biases and anomalies evident in patterns of securities’ pricing. In the aftermath of the GFC, it has been argued that there are systemic tendencies in financial markets that drive markets away from a sustainable equilibrium (Haldane and May 2011; Stiglitz 2014).  \n\nYet, markets vary around the world according to their transparency, the significance or otherwise of third-party information, and the mechanisms that transmit information among agents in markets (Clark and W6jcik 2007). The value attributed to information in developed markets need not apply to emerging ones. Dealing with the issue of investing offshore when market structure and performance fail to match the experience of home markets is an important theme of the book. We take seriously the geography of finance. The EMH was also framed by reference to a representative agent—an unencumbered market participant. These individuals exist and play a role in the formation of market prices and expectations (Barber and Odean 2001). However, in developed markets, many traders are the employees of institutional investors who not only limit the former's discretion but also impose upon them a house view' related to the products they manage and sell. There is, in this sense, an agency problem in that managers may be less well placed than their traders to understand the flux and flow of market expectations.  \n\nInstitutional investors operate in a distinctive environment. A risk-adjusted rate of return is a stream of income realized repeatedly at the end of each trading term, and is summed together over a period to be reported at designated points in time. Trading strategies and periods typically map onto the rhythm of daily life in the relevant jurisdictions. Three implications follow and are vital when we come to explaining how and why the management ^problem' is so important for institutional investors. First, agents (employees and/or service providers) often time the stream of returns to match reporting dates. Second, switching mandates between the managers of investment products representing specific asset classes, sectors, and/or geographies, need not result in superior rates of return net of switching costs (Ellis 2012; Litterman et al. 2004). Third, herding around certain times, events, and metrics is—at least for senior managers—a challenge in that the interests of the client may be quite different from those of the portfolio managers.  \n\n### Risk and Uncertainty  \n\nFinancial markets are subject to risk and uncertainty. Risk refers to the probability of a certain outcome or set of outcomes, and uncertainty to either an inability to attribute a risk premium to a class of possible future events, or an inability to foretell what is likely to be salient in the future—-a distinction owed, among others, to Keynes (1948) and Knight (1921). Some analysts treat risk and uncertainty as synonymous and seek to reduce uncertainty to risk.  \n\nWhile risk and uncertainty are related, the two concepts are best treated as distinctive and different (Diebold et al. 2010). At any point in time, events anchored in recognized market processes show that risk models are effective tools for estimating their likely occurrence and impact. It is also possible to use skill and expertise to extend the applicability of these tools to related or analogous situations. As events unfold, and as new information becomes available, risk models can be updated and re-estimated. In these ways, risk models ‘colonize’ uncertainty in the sense that they work until they fail— whereas unanticipated events disturb the status quo.  \n\nThese elements of risk management—models, skill, and expertise—are represented in Figure 1.1 (at a particular point in time and space). To the extent that risk models are effective, they can be applied repeatedly by machine and/or agents. To the extent that these models can be extended to analogous or related situations (X-Y), trading systems dominate (Gilboa et al. 2014). Where skill and expertise are required in the application and assessment of risk models (Y-Z) will depend, in part, on experience. Expertise can facilitate judgement, in the sense that pattern recognition systems can aid assessment and choice between models. However, as unanticipated events disturb risk models, and as market expectations are increasingly violated in ways that challenge experience and pattern recognition systems, skill and expertise come to the fore. Put slightly differently, inherited decision rules and cognitive biases in favour of known conditions may trip the unwary and the inexperienced in the manner suggested by Barber and Odean (2001), among others. This takes analysts to instances where models begin to fail (Z-Y) and then to uncertainty, represented in Figure 1.1 by the darkly shaded area to the right of skill and expertise, which grows and shrinks as less or more stability dominates market expectations.  \n\n![](images/483dd694bd73c02f120cb7cb14d8c1c1b0a230ae76d2298a965cc2d55566c0e2.jpg)  \nFigure 1.1. Mapping risk and uncertainty Source: Authors and John Whiteman  \n\nTime has been emphasized in the context of a particular market environment in a shared jurisdiction. Figure 1.1 is, of course, in three dimensions, representing the risks and uncertainties associated with investment at home and abroad. So, for example, it is widely recognized that investors at home tend to be better in the sense that their ability to colonize uncertainty is more effective; this is because they are either better informed or more knowledgeable about the market at hand (Wojcik 2009). Expectations are formed at a point in time and space, even if the home domain of clients anchors their “location', which may be virtual insofar as it is at the intersection of transaction-related market agents.2 It is also apparent that some markets are more stable than others due to the nature of regulation, the depth of liquidity, and scope and reliability of market information. In some markets, the tradeoff between risk and return implies a premium on market position that is more important than in other financial markets. In these circumstances, it is difficult to colonize uncertainty with any confidence because of the difficulties in identifying, collecting, and valuing salient information.3  \n\nHere, risk and uncertainty are treated as fundamental attributes of financial markets. It should also be acknowledged that the risks associated with an investment strategy are related to the rate of return, to the objectives of institutions, and to the mandates allocated to portfolio managers. An investment strategy may produce a relatively predictable but lower stream of returns with relatively less risk than some other strategies. On the other hand, a higher-return target implies greater risk. In the first instance, a low risk/low return product is likely to be found at the centre of the market, while a high risk/high return product is likely to be found on the margin of the market, where the boundary between risk and uncertainty is more permeable and returns are reliant on judgement. In these ways, models of market performance and their investment strategies can be translated into investment products.  \n\n### Learning by Doing  \n\nRecent research on learning by doing in manufacturing companies suggests that knowledge management can be quite effective. Levitt et al. (2012) show that shift-based learning in an automobile plant can be rapid, and the lessons learned from process innovation are readily transferred between shifts without an appreciable loss of effciency. Three assumptions underpin their analysis. First, the production process is replicable time after time. Second, learning by doing is viable because its effects are directly measurable. Third, the process of innovation is incremental and additive rather than disruptive of the existing configuration of production. An interesting aspect of the Levitt et al. study is the authors' silence about how learning is organized so that lessons are transferred between shifts. They are also, given the ever-present temptation to backslide or forget lessons gleaned from earlier experiences, silent on how the lessons learned are sustained over time.  \n\nAlevy et al. (2007), by contrast, suggest that finance professionals know that producing investment returns is not entirely predictable. Learning by doing is contingent on one's place in the market (time and space) and unanticipated events can profoundly disrupt expectations. Models of the market can be both calibrated against the past and used to predict the future (against limits or parameters). The  ready availability of relevant information—expressed through key variables, estimated relationships, and measures of goodness of fit—-does, of course, reinforce confidence in these models of markets. However, when analysts look forward, these models become sets of beliefs— hypotheses or expectations—-about the future.4 Expectations may be realized and confidence in their robustness reinforced. Inevitably, in the future and/or in some other market, expectations will not be met. The issue is whether past success can be set aside in the interests of exercising judgement in ways that are relevant to current circumstances (Fox and Tversky 1995).  \n\nIn a stable financial environment, skilled market participants are better able than their less skilled counterparts to improve their trading skills and capacity to realize return objectives (Campbell et al. 2011). However, where unanticipated events conspire to disrupt expectations, processing information becomes more important than the knowledge of the agent or institution (expressed as informed judgement and expertise). Weitzman (2007) observed that the world of financial markets is fraught with uncertainty: ‘the way-toolarge empirical volatility of equity prices seems badly disconnected from the basic spirit of a real-economy-driven REE (rational expectations equilibrium). Instead of self-confident REE investors with sure expectations of objective frequencies generated by an already known stochastic structure (about which nothing further remains to be learned), the whole situation looks and feels like skittish investors nervously reacting to unsure expectations of unknown deeper forces of shifting structure.5 Learning by doing is probably only a momentary ^fix’ on a system in motion-—never going backwards and always going forward in unexpected ways.  \n\n# METHODOLOGY AND EXPOSITION  \n\nOur book provides an analytical framework for understanding the governance and management of financial institutions. This mode of presentation is one among many in the cognate fields of economic geography, finance, and management (Amin and Cohendet 2004; Baker et al. 2002; Storper and Salais 1997). Our systematic approach to the principles underpinning the structure and performance of institutional investors provides a way of understanding the nature and scope of industry practice. This strategy can be justified in many ways. For instance, it is a necessary first step in guiding the empirical analysis of specific instances and industry formations. Nonetheless, as our discussion on the significance of risk and uncertainty indicates, our framework is sensitive to the environment in which financial institutions operate. As such, our approach has a higher level of specificity than many theory-led models of the firm.  \n\nWhile, throughout the book, we desist from identifying particular organizations, service providers, and intermediaries, this should not be taken as implying that details do not matter. They do matter, as Chapters 5 and 6 on the nature and scope of contractual relationships between the buy side and the sell side of the market indicate. Here, we show that the nature and regulation of commercial relationships, the negotiation and governance of contracts, and the accountability of the financial services industry at home and abroad are embedded in geography (McCormick 2010). One contribution of the book is its recognition of the degree to which being embedded frames the governance and management of financial institutions. There is already a large and extensive body of research on commodity-producing and -distributing industries with extensive global footprints (see Durand and Wrigley (2009) on the global retailing industry). The contribution of this book, however, is to the growing research programme and cognate disciplines looking at the nature and significance of the global financial services industry, advanced business services, and related institutional formations of policy and governance.6  \n\nOur analytical framework draws on extensive fieldwork and brings together related literature from geography, economics, and finance to provide an informed assessment of the fundamental logics driving organizational behaviour in global financial markets. We utilize, at times, a comparative perspective that crosses the United Kingdom, Europe, North America, Australasia, the Middle East, and beyond. However, where we might have limited our focus to the intersection between financial institutions and their home’ jurisdictions, we place the former in a global context. In so doing, we rely on participant observation in the global financial services industry, involving, among others, asset owners, asset managers, intermediaries such as custodians and brokers, and the providers of consulting and legal services—-in short, the ecology of the industry (for related research, see Faulconbridge (2006); Faulconbridge et al. (2007); W6jcik (2009)). As such, knowledge and experience of the industry and, in particular, of the management problem facing asset owners in relation to the asset management industry are distilled into linked propositions, industry conditions, and key dilemmas.  \n\nFieldwork can be linked to long-standing traditions in economic geography and economics. For example, Clark (1998) refers to ^close dialogue′ as a form of bilateral engagement with the organizational principals that emphasize the importance of understanding one's own perspective, as well as the key issues, dilemmas, and industry settings of one's organization. In many respects, the senior managers of institutional investors are quite aware of how their organizations function, including the constraints that affect organizational performance and innovation. Drawing on Adam Smith and the research practices associated with modern industrial economics, Helper (2000) makes a series of related points to justify the usefulness of so-called “factory visits'. As will become obvious, we believe that fieldwork provides an invaluable means of understanding how organizations function more or less effectively, which is a point we amplify in Chapter 2. We also demonstrate that fieldwork does not stand on its own: the insights gleaned from engagement with organizations and their principals allow us to interrogate and develop theoretical principles.  \n\nFieldwork also comes in many forms. It was made possible by access to key decision makers inside and outside a wide variety of financial institutions and organizations. Without adequate access, fieldwork can become sterile in terms of insight and theoretical sophistication. In some instances, the sponsorship of major research organizations made access possible. Our previous book on sovereign wealth funds (Clark et al. 2013) represents this type of approach. Over the years, in Oxford and Stanford, we have convened the informal and formal research clubs of financial institutions and organizations with a view to building up networks of contacts and providing a venue for senior managers to meet one another. We have used clubs to foster the exchange of ideas and research projects on governance and management. In some cases, we have become involved in these organizations as advisers, board members, and paid employees. As a result, readers of our previously published papers will have noted that we tend to present our findings from the inside (the practice of governance and management) to the outside (the theoretical principles of organizational design and performance).  \n\nThis type of engagement comes with obligations. Sponsoring and participating in the research clubs of an industry's organizations presupposes a degree of confidentiality and non-disclosure, which is more consistent with the Chatham House rule than with the attribution of expressed views to individuals and their sponsoring organizations. As for giving advice, under these circumstances, it is as important to listen to senior managers as it is to make specific recommendations. Consistent with our intellectual project, we were keen to identify and distribute best practice and solve specific problems. Here, of course, there is a fine line between research, advice, and implementation. While implementation is key, we were conscious of the need to honour the principles of confidentiality and so disclose, where appropriate, actual or possible conflicts of interest. We have placed our exposition of the principles and practices of industry within a framework of academic norms and conventions. Our insights and conclusions are intended neither to advance the cause of any organization nor to do anything other than contribute to a richer understanding of the industry.  \n\nIn the first five of our chapters, we focus on the nature and role of contracts in the global financial services industry. Our analytical strategy is grounded in a particular market environment. As noted, risk and uncertainty are pervasive aspects of financial markets and are arguably deeply embedded in the contractual relationships that bring together financial institutions and their suppliers. Likewise, we suggest that the geography of a contract is important, for jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and the United States serve as bridges between geographically dispersed financial institutions and centralized market providers. In these ways, our approach is more akin to Macauley's (1963, 1985) sociology of contractual relations and to Bathelt and Gluckler's (2011) relational economic geography than it is to standard treatments of contract. We are more concerned with the reality of contracting in the global financial services industry than with the theory of optimal contracting, even if we are mindful of the value of such a reference point (Bolton and Dewatripont 2005).  \n\nAny treatment of a private contract is necessarily abstract because contracts are proprietary documents. As such, they are subject to confidential clauses designed to limit third-party disclosure of the form, terms, and conditions of the agreement. In a number of instances, we encountered situations in which disclosure of contractual terms and conditions was strictly limited between functions, even within organizations. It is not surprising, therefore, that most studies of contract in the social sciences, including economics, sociology, and management studies, do not disclose the sites of fieldwork, the nature and content of the documents analysed, or the parties involved. For example, the seminal studies of the practice of contract by Macauley (1963, 1985) and Macneil (1985) make no mention of the terms and conditions of specific contracts or of who was involved in them. Empirical research on contracts tends to rely on US court cases, which lay bare the issues, arguments, and points of dispute; even here, however, court opinions do not report the substance of the contracts in dispute. These documents are unobtainable for public viewing, even in the court in which the dispute was heard.  \n\nConsequently, how contractual relationships in the industry are portrayed in this book should be treated as provisional rather than definitive. Despite having conducted numerous interviews and compared diverse types of contractual frameworks across asset classes, different kinds of financial institutions (for example, public and private pension funds and sovereign wealth funds), and service providers in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States, we are unable to violate confidentiality. Our research suggests that the shackles of confidentiality tend to favour the provider side of the market because few clients have either the legal resources or the information needed to challenge the terms and conditions of proffered contracts. As many legal scholars have noted, the ideal contract is a chimera in which the practice of contract involves the exercise of power (Shiffrin 2007). Likewise, the choice of jurisdiction in relation to the exercise of a contract can also be intimately related to the relative powers of the contractual parties.  \n\nMaking sense of the form and content of public-sector contracts is also challenging. In Chapter 7, we consider US state and local government contracts for financial services in some detail. While state and local governments may disclose the basic terms of a service contract, it is difficult to gain access to either an RFP (request for proposal) or actual contract. In some cases, despite most RFPs and contracts being proprietary documents, we were able to report on public employee retirement systems (PERS), RFPs, and investment management agreements (IMAs). Legal penalties can be invoked if confidentiality is violated. That PERS contracts are often subject to partisan commentary and debate reinforces caution about public disclosure. Interviews with senior managers of US public-sector pension institutions, covering a range of topics and stretching over more than a decade, sustained our research on the governance and management of PERS (Clark 2008; Hagerman et al. 2006). We also had opportunities to investigate the governance and management of related public and private financial institutions and their service providers on both sides of the Atlantic.  \n\nAs in the related research on contracts, our analysis, which is cross-sectional rather than time-dependent, is driven by specific institutions and their documents (Argyres et al. 2007; Mayer and Argyres 2004). Furthermore, problems of access have prevented us from commenting on the evolution of sector- or jurisdiction-specific contractual norms and conventions. Our focus is on how the process of contracting is organized and substantiated in the manner suggested by, among others, Deakin and Michie (2000). Following Macauley (1985), and those inspired by his sociology of contract, we have drawn our insights from detailed studies of the substantive content of RPFs, IMAs, and contracts, as well as from British and European research on the structure and logic of contract law as it pertains to the investment management industry. As such, our analysis of contract in this book is an exercise in analysis and clarification grounded in knowledge of service agreements and contracts gleaned from fieldwork, freedom of information (FOl) requests, and intensive searches of state and local PERS websites.  \n\n### OUTLINE OF THE BOOK  \n\nIn Chapter 2, we turn to the issue of the status of institutional investors in the global economy. We discriminate between different types of institutional investors-endowments, family offices, and pension funds on the one hand, and the conventional roles and responsibilities of asset owners, holders, and managers working in banks and stand-alone asset-management companies on the other. We begin with the issue of intermediation, which indicates that an important function of asset owners and holders is to collect savings and financial commitments from dispersed individuals and to place them in financial markets to reap a risk-adjusted rate of return. Both institutions and intermediaries, like asset managers, can place collected assets. Most importantly,we explain how the use of the term‘institutional investors'，with reference to the current debate in the social sciences on institutions and organizations, emphasizes the legal status of many institutional investors, as well as the fact that they are organizations that must be governed and managed. These are key issues for the entire book.  \n\nIn Chapter 3, we show that information systems are fundamental to the production of investment returns. At one level, this involves collecting information from financial markets to transmit to institutional investors with a view to informing investment strategy and its implementation. At another level, of course, it involves sharing information within an organization to facilitate the investment process and the coordination of the various component parts that make up an institution's investment strategy. Many institutional investors utilize the information systems of third-party providers and face considerable challenges in coordinating those systems with respect to managing the investment process. More recently, some institutional investors have introduced their own organization-wide information management systems with a view to imposing order on the flow of information that otherwise may be chaotic. Investments in spatially extensive financial markets are a demonstration of the significance of this issue.  \n\nTurning to Chapter 4, we introduce the reader to the most basic of issueshow institutional investors produce investment returns over time and space. In doing so, senior managers coordinate the investment process in relation to the institution's goals and objectives. We demonstrate how and why the powers of senior managers are contingent rather than absolute: because of the significance of human capital in the investment process, the market for skill and expertise may compromise the authority of senior managers to set investment strategies, as well as asset-specific risk and return investment objectives. Strategies of management, like divide-and-conquer (DAC) or incorporation, are used to address these issues. It is also demonstrated that a growing volume of assets under management (AUM) can significantly affect senior managers' capacities to innovate.  \n\nHaving established a framework through which to understand the production of investment returns, in Chapter 5 we expand on the significance of two types of intangible assets crucial to realizing the mission of institutional investors. One is the human capital of the organization and its related partners and providers, the other the decision-making protocols and procedures used to formulate and implement investment strategy. Whereas some commentators suggest that the production of risk-adjusted rates of return can, or should, be understood by reference to the production of any other type of manufactured product, we contend that this type of analogy is unhelpful in understanding what is distinctive about the global financial services industry. Specifically, we tackle the issue of insourcing and outsourcing—the make or buy question—-and the matter of producing investment returns at home rather than offshore.  \n\nChapters 3 to 5 adopt an internal perspective on the production proces. In Chapters 6 and 7 we looked more closely at relationships between asset owners and asset managers and, specifically, the formulation and governance of service contracts binding institutional  investors to their providers. In Chapter 6, we draw on our field research to explain the role of contract in relationships between asset owners and asset managers, referencing current practice in the United Kingdom, Europe, and North America. We show that these relationships appear symmetrical in that this type of service contract can be terminated at will. However, appearances are deceptive. In many cases, such contracts are asymmetrical in that asset owners often rely on asset managers because they lack the capabilities and resources to do otherwise. It is noted that the laws of England and Wales figure prominently in industry practice worldwide and bind together clients and providers across spatially extensive financial markets.  \n\nIn Chapter 7, the focus shifts from private to public agents and we look closely at the process of contracting for financial services in US state and local pension funds. This chapter addresses the costs and consequences of institutional governance and management in the US state and local pension-fund sector. Although the protocols and procedures of state governments dominate contracting in this sector, the formulation of investment contracts in accordance with the conventional model of intermediation can be highly idiosyncratic. It is shown that ‘standard practices’ hide the considerable diversity among US state and local pension funds, especially in the terms and conditions of investment contracts, and in the substance of specific service agreements for more or less significant services. In the penultimate section of the chapter, we refer to an idealized model of institutional design and the governance and management of the investment management process.  \n\nThe conventional model of intermediation depends on a couple of key actors, namely consulting actuaries and asset consultants. In Chapter 8, we look at their roles and responsibilities in relation to asset owners and holders and the process of investment management. In doing so, we provide a baseline from which to understand these roles and responsibilities; we also differentiate between small, medium, and large owners and holders of assets.  \n\nIn a conventional model of intermediation, consulting actuaries and asset consultants claim influence by virtue of their access to knowledge about and understanding of the investment management process. Here, we provide a framework through which to understand consultants' value in the framing of investment strategies and their implementation, emphasizing issues of process as well as substance. As financial markets have become more challenging environments in which to produce investment returns, and as larger asset owners have moved towards disintermediation, insourcing, and reintermediation, the role of consultants in sustaining innovation in the practice of investment has become an issue.  \n\nIn Chapter 9, we extend our discussion of intermediation and the role of consultants to focus on the so-called outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO) model of investment strategy and implementation. We explain how and why this is a desirable mode of organization; and we emphasize issues of size and scope that are either unavailable internally or available at a price that is inconsistent with the best interests of beneficiaries. Here, we also identify the principles and practices associated with best practice, as well as the challenges associated with governing relationships with entities that are charged with responsibility for managing the entire value chain.  \n\nAs suggested in Chapter 8, there is a premium on innovation in the production of investment returns. This premium can be realized in a number of ways, which include promoting different methods of framing investment strategy and its implementation, as well as different ways of governing and managing intermediaries. In Chapter 10, our focus is on strategies of cooperation and collaboration between similar types of institutional investors. We set out the advantages and disadvantages of different kinds of cooperation and collaboration, as well as issues concerning the governance and management of these types of semiformal arrangements. We note that these arrangements can empower senior managers in their own organizations and so facilitate longterm solutions to the formulation and implementation of an investment strategy. We also note that cooperation and collaboration are likely to be only partial solutions to the costs and consequences of organizational inertia and the entrenchment of common interests.  \n\nChapter 11 is the final chapter of the book. It looks forward, emphasizing the forces motivating institutional innovation and the imperatives driving institutional investors towards different forms of management. We note the urgency behind reintermediation, arguing that it is unlikely that financial markets will return to ^normal if normal is to be understood as the 1980s and 1990s where a balanced portfolio was a winning formula for investment strategy. This chapter is also about the different ways in which institutional innovation can take place in the sector given the nature of many institutions and their political constituencies.  \n\n# NOTES  \n\n1. There is considerable interest in the nature and significance of unanticipated events, with some theorists, notably Barro (2006), arguing that these events are so significant that they reframe market structure, beliefs, and expectations. Rather than treating these events as anomalous, and excluding them as such, Barro suggests that these events reset market dynamics and, after some time, become incorporated into market behaviour.   \n2. Time and space are inextricably bound together. In the initial stages of a financial crisis, to cope with uncertainty agents and institutions tend to retreat from other markets to focus on just one. In later phases of a crisis, agents and institutions tend to reach out to other markets to compensate for the limits apparent in the home one. Therefore, the relationship between time and space is strategic rather than antagonistic (cf. Murdoch et al. 2000 with Clark and Thrift 2005).   \n3. Cognitive scientists distinguish between encoding data and attributing meaning to information, thus suggesting that meaning making is a higher-order cognitive function (Bor 2012: 53). Some authors, including Gabaix and Laibson (2006), suggest that sorting through received information according to salience is commonplace; otherwise, data from the environment are likely to overwhelm the decision-making (Aragones et al. 2005).   \n4. Recent research on the nature and stability of beliefs and their status in theory and practice can be found in Ellsberg (1961); Kurz (1994); Manski (2004); and Rook (2014).   \n5. Weitzman (2007: 1103) goes on to remark in a nonergodic situation where hidden parameters are evolving, everyone is perennially uncertain about current structure and learning is not converging to an REE because no matter how the data are filtered there are not “true\" REE structural-parameter values to converge to'. Emphasis is in the original text, excluding a footnote.   \n6. See, for example, Coe (2014); Faulconbridge and Muzio (2009); French et al. (2011); Maurer (2008); and W6jcik (2013).  \n\n### 2  \n\n### Institutions and Organizations  \n\nOne response to the global financial crisis (GFC) was to look afresh at the role and significance of financial institutions, whatever their organizational forms. Inspired by interventions from Haldane (2009) and Haldane and May (2011), policymakers have sought to better understand the behaviour of banks, as well as their interactions with one another. Caught up in the net cast by financial regulators have been large asset managers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds. Given their size and significance for their host economies, and given their importance for the structure and performance of global financial markets, it is not surprising that some regulators have deemed these organizations systemically important financial institutions.  \n\nIn this chapter, we explain how and why we apply the phrase financial institutions' to asset owners of various types whose purpose is the realization of target risk-adjusted rates of return on assets under management (AUM).1 We note that these types of asset owners are typically beneficial' in conception and by intent; that is, they act on behalf of those whose long-term welfare is served by their investment strategies and decisions. We could use the phrase ‘beneficial institutions′ to label these organizations, for to do so would be consistent with their goals and objectives. Notwithstanding their ultimate purpose, it is also important to see them as they function—as financial institutions that are as important as banks in terms of the scope and significance of their activities and, perhaps, more important than many banks in terms of their influence over the long-term shape of capitalist economies. It is apparent that many nation-states have broadened the scope of their statutory and regulatory frameworks to take account of these institutions’ financial functions and activities.  \n\nFinancial institutions are also organizations in that they govern and manage their activities in ways that the theory of organizations and their distinctive attributes by sector and jurisdiction can explain. This point is made by comparing banks with asset owners, isolating their formal differences while bringing to the fore their commonalities. As such, we take on the challenge of explaining how and why asset owners are organized in the ways they are and the implications to be drawn from their performance in global financial markets. We begin with March and Simon (1958) because their approach to analysing large organizations resonates with our experience of observing the activities of asset owners around the world. However, as we suggest, it is insufficient simply to rely on their theory of organizations as if the logic of organizational design were set in stone. Senior managers of large asset owners have sought to vary organizational form and functions in ways that serve the overarching goals of their host institutions—-hence, the emphasis we place on recent research on the make-or-buy issue in economics, which we frame here in terms of insourcing versus outsourcing and disintermediation versus reintermediation.  \n\n# NOMENCLATURE  \n\nAs observed in Chapter 1, we focus on the organization of financial institutions commonly referred to as institutional investors (Davis and Steil 2o01). Broadly speaking, institutional investors include asset owners and asset managers. The former are often deemed to include endowments, family offices, foundations, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds, whereas the latter include companies such as BlackRock, JP Morgan Chase, and State Street. As briefly mentioned in the Introduction, these asset owners and asset managers are also organizations; that is, they are sets of people, capabilities, and resources established and managed for a purpose or set of purposes (Helfat et al. 2007). As organizations, institutional investors face significant coordination and management challenges in the face of market risk and uncertainty. Whereas much of the academic literature on banking and finance uses the terms institutions’ and ‘organizations′ interchangeably, in the social science literature these types of entities are labelled and their forms and functions analysed in a variety of ways. Here, we aim to be transparent about the use of these terms.  \n\nBeing an ‘owner' is to have a legally enforceable property right. Pension funds are not really asset owners but asset holders'; that is, they act on behalf of those who have transferred their property rights or entitlements to the pension fund (Morrison and Wilhelm 2007). Pension-fund participants are the ultimate owners of funds invested and managed on their behalf. Nonetheless, let us be clear about the powers of pension and sovereign wealth funds. These entities normally have an exclusive right to invest and manage financial assets, powers that their sponsors (businesses and governments) rather than the participants (individuals and citizens) assign. Using the terms Hirschman (1971) made popular, participants more often than not have no effective voice in the investment and management of their assets and rarely have the option to exit from such an entity. Where governments allow pension-fund participants the right to exit should they so wish, they rarely exercise that option. In many cases, loyalty is taken for granted.  \n\nWe use the terms ‘asset owners' and ‘asset managers' as they are in everyday life. We also observe that it is commonplace to refer to them as institutional investors as well as financial institutions. People using these terms rarely consider their epistemological status as concepts underpinned by certain theoretical frameworks or modes of explanation. Being labelled a financial institution is another way of describing an institutional investor, assuming the latter shares with other entities a similar organizational form and similar types of functions. For example, banks are sometimes described as financial institutions and sometimes as institutional investors. This blurs the definition of what a bank is, or is not, to include entities that perform bank-like functions, such as taking deposits, lending, and investing. This broad-gauged use of the phrase ‘financial institutions’ is found in recent studies devoted to explaining the status of, and possible regulatory reform of, systemically important financial institutions (Cihak and Nier 2012; Haldane and May 2011).  \n\nFor many years, banks were seen as archetypical financial institutions insofar as they could take on a variety of forms, conduct a number of related activities, and provide a well-defined range of services. Their single most important function was to act as an intermediary between savers and investors (Diamond 1984). In so doing, banks and related financial institutions were located at the very centre of modern economies: without financial intermediaries transforming savings into investments, modern economies would not exist, at least not as we know them (Mayer and Vives 1993). Of course, many banks became more than intermediaries and took on significant investment management functions. Saving and investing organizations, financial institutions, and financial intermediaries are therefore all institutional investors. Whatever their label, the difference between a commercial entity and a financial institution is surely the importance of the latter for the growth and stability of market economies (King and Levine 1995).  \n\nMany Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) governments define financial institutions by statute and regulation. One US definition includes insured depository institutions, credit unions insured by the federal government, federal home loan banks, mortgage companies, and much else besides. Also included are Federal Reserve banks, the branches or agencies of foreign banks, and ‘any person or entity that makes in whole or in part a federally related mortgage loan'.? These entities can claim support from the US federal government should they come close to, or default on, their commitments. See US Code Title 18 Crimes and Criminal Procedure. Under US Code Chapter 53, Subchapter II Records and Reports on Monetary Instruments and Transactions, a ^financial institution' includes the entities listed as well as credit card providers, dealers in commodities, and any ‘person’ or ‘network of persons? engaged in the business of transferring money ^domestically or internationally'. Furthermore, the secretary of the Treasury is provided with powers to treat any business as a ^financial institution' if need be.? In this context, institutional investors are, or can be, officially designated financial institutions.  \n\nMore recent official definitions distinguish between financial services and financial institutions. For example, the Swiss government leaves unspecified what counts as a financial service and/or financial instrument, thereby providing regulatory agencies with the powers to respond to product innovation in financial markets. The Swiss Financial Institutions Act establishes a supervisory regime for organizations, like pension funds, deemed ‘financial institutions' (Rapin and Petermann 2015). The Canadian Offce of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act treats pension funds in the same way as it treats financial institutions. Likewise, the Insurance Companies Act includes as a financial institution, whether incorporated federally or provincially, any entity primarily engaged in dealing securities, including portfolio management and investment counselling'. Note, however, that pension funds are also trust-based institutions in countries reliant on an English common-law heritage. As such, pension funds are not always subject to countries’ and states’ company laws and regulations, although they can directly own and be shareholders of listed and unlisted companies (Clark 2000).  \n\nOne implication to be drawn from this discussion is that there is some confusion over the differences between an institutional investor and a financial institution. Given that there is general agreement about the significance of certain types of financial functions for modern economies, aside from differences in terms of their organizational forms and specific functions, the terms are often used interchangeably. It is also apparent that there is a certain history embedded in the use of these terms. For example, more often than not an institutional investor is, or has been, an asset owner or asset manager, whereas more often than not a financial institution is, or has been, a bank or deposittaking and lending organization.  \n\nOver the past couple of decades, these distinctions have become blurred, partly because banks have extended their reach into functions normally associated with asset managers and partly because asset owners and managers have taken on functions typically associated with banks, like direct placements and lending. Some endowments, foundations, and pension funds now have such significant financial holdings that many countries have brought them into their systems of prudential regulation and supervision. Formally or by default, pension funds and entities such as foundations, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds that ^deal securities’ are considered financial institutions.  \n\n# INSTITUTIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES  \n\nIn our discussion of institutional investors as financial institutions, we referred to the common use of the term ‘institution' in banking and finance. To summarize, in this academic field, and in related public policy domains, institutional investors are a set of financial institutions located at the very heart of developed countries′ financial systems. Indeed, by some accounts, because they act as essential intermediaries between savers and investors, these entities have made possible the growth and development of modern economies (King and Levine 1995a, 1995b). National and international rules and regulations underwrite their status and provide them with a licence to operate across a wide range of financial activities and services. Because they are a certain size, are essential to economic growth and development, and are deeply embedded in commercial transactions of all kinds, it is arguable that financial institutions are one of a select number of institutions that sustain modern societies around the world.  \n\nOur discussion to this point begs the question of what constitutes an institution beyond that suggested by the term “financial institution'. Also left to one side was the relationship between institutions and organizations. At the outset, we suggested that financial institutions are also organizations that must be governed and managed to realize their objectives. This much is obvious. Nevertheless, the significance attributed to institutions suggests that they have a certain status or importance separate and different from organizations. In a similar manner, any reading or debate in the social sciences about institutions would quickly conclude that they have a distinctive status and are different from organizations. Whereas financial institutions are more often than not defined as such in government statutes and through regulations, the category of ‘institution' in the social sciences is less about entities established for various reasons or purposes than it is an idea at the intersection between the individual and society (Scott 2008). In this section, we consider a number of the threads of argument in the social sciences about institutions and institutionalism.  \n\nWriters of surveys about research on institutions often begin by acknowledging the importance of Max Weber's late nineteenth-century bureaucracies. Sociologists often value Weber's work more than contemporary institutional theorists do and this is partly because Weber was more interested in the centralization of administrative functions in the state through the Industrial Revolution than in the ontological status of institutions in modern societies and economies. Nonetheless, his work inspired a research programme that has lasted for more than a century. Wilson (1989), for example, writes about the irrationalities of modern bureaucratic behaviour and provides various ethnographies of life lived within large pension funds and the financial services industry. O'Barr and Conley (1992) discuss the latter in their work on the culture of institutional investors, while Riles (2011) looks at the formalization of decision-making in global financial institutions. In part, this research tradition has focused on the mentality of bureaucracies and the persistence of institutions in the face of economic imperatives. Shonfield (1965) and Galbraith (1967), writing on the postwar experiences of the United Kingdom and United States respectively, reflect on the influence of this research tradition, so situate corporations in the context of the modern state rather than the market.  \n\nA break with this tradition came with North's (1990: 4) assertion that institutions, in the first instance, are perfectly analogous to the rules of the game in a competitive team sport'. More specifically, he had in mind formal systems of rules such as constitutions and regulatory frameworks that provide individuals with a well-defined action space through which to realize their objectives while imposing limits on individual behaviour that would violate, in some way, the collective interest in a well-functioning and predictable environment. Formal systems of rules are also general principles that may include, for example, the protection of private property and of freely made commitments or contracts between private agents. He also made reference to informal rules, or what others refer to as norms and conventions. For some theorists, like Brennan et al. (2014), norms and conventions come before formal systems of rules, for they form the basis of the subsequent codification of standards of conduct.  \n\nIt is possible that formal and informal systems of rules can exist without an administrative apparatus. Rawls's (1971) theory of justice simply requires individuals in a state of nature or, as he described it, the original position, to conduct a series of thought experiments. In these they must imagine a set of rules that would be consistent with their long-term interests, but they would not know what particular social position they would occupy when the mind game turned into the experienced world. However, few theorists are so sanguine. Most believe that sanctions and incentives backed by coercion are necessary if people are to follow the rules in circumstances where some have more power than others (Milhaupt and Pistor 2008; Posner 1986). In our world, the nation-state provides these functions, distinguished, of course, by history and geography (past dependence) (Gertler 2017). Therefore, we can reasonably suppose that a set of rules can be given a specific organizational form over and above its existence as a set of ideals (Scott 2008). Insofar as the nation-state, along with its regulatory agencies, embodies these rules, something other than the state itself sustains their legitimacy.  \n\nWe should notice, however, that the theory of rules as institutions has certain shortcomings. First, rules as institutions are only effective if they are parsimonious, coherent, and complementary. In other words, there are welldefined boundaries between rules; each is transparent in relation to the others; and, as a set, they complement and reinforce one another. Second, rules as institutions are only effective if they are salient and have a mechanism or mechanisms enabling them to evolve to remain relevant as circumstances change. Third, rules as institutions must, in some sense, be self-generative in application so that they do not require agents to interpret their salience, meaning, or relative status as events change. In other words, there is a degree of idealism embedded in rules as institutions, which, in effect, discounts the possibility that the institutions charged with realizing the virtues of agreed rules will dominate the meaning attributed to them and their application.  \n\nThe theory of rules as institutions has some of the same shortcomings as H. L. A. Hart's (1961) positive theory of law. As Dworkin (1986) showed, the real world of “hard cases' needs something more than rules if justice is to be done. He suggested that behind rules as institutions lie moral ideals. When rules conflict with one another, when complexity confounds their coherence, and when one rule is not enough to make a decision but a combination of them simply adds to the confusion, a higher order may be needed to bring resolution if not common agreement. By this logic, rules are insuffcient; real institutions with authority and legitimacy are needed to make the decisions that rules by themselves are unable to produce. This is one way of explaining how and why the US Federal Reserve Bank jettisoned its rulebook during the GFC: it was, and still is, more than an agency designed to implement the rules of monetary policy-making. Quite literally, it claimed the authority and responsibility to act on behalf of society in the absence of effective rules.  \n\nWhile rules as institutions provide a rationale for the state and its administrative functions, the real world of institutions is more challenging. Here, there are two schools of thought. Roe (2006) and others argue that government agencies tend to be established to ^solve' problems not amenable to solution through established procedures, markets, or organizations. He suggests, however, that once established, these agencies have a life of their own and become a permanent feature of the institutional landscape. As such, the ‘real' world of regulatory agencies is dominated by overlapping, competing, and inconsistent institutions that separately claim legitimacy but together complicate, even paralyse, effective decision-making and policymaking. Public choice theorists such as Steger (2002) go one step further by arguing that state agencies and institutions have ^constituencies’ that sustain their powers and authority in return for favours. One way or another, conflict within and between institutions is commonplace. Often the reconciliation of such conflicts, while entirely commendable, is typically either partial or ineffective, so limiting what policymakers can accomplish.  \n\n# ORGANIZATIONS, INSIDE AND OUT  \n\nIn our discussion of the nature and status of institutional investors, we noted that these types of entities are normally identified as and labelled ^financial institutions'. As well, we have suggested that their status, in this regard, is due in part to their size and significance for modern economies. Standing between savers and investors, institutional investors provide a set of functions that are essential to contemporary market economies, and underwrite economic growth and development. We have also suggested that, in part, they owe their authority and legitimacy to the fact that they embody certain rules, or modes of performance, which in their organizational manifestations represent elements analogous to North's ‘rules of the game'. Most importantly, we sought to discount the idealism of the new institutionalism in favour of a realist conception of these privileged entities, which matches Davis's (2015) interest in the lived life of organizations.  \n\nThis returns us to the point made that institutions are also organizations. However, as suggested, not all organizations are institutions. In other words, not all organizations have the formal or informal status attributed to institutions—the status that embodies important social functions, rules, or objectives. To explain, consider the place of pension funds and sovereign wealth funds in modern societies. These entities have important economic, financial, and social functions consistent with their privileged locations between savers and investors. They also embody and, through their activities, underwrite the rules of the game, including the rules underwriting the process of intermediation. Finally, their privileged positions as the exclusive custodians of participants' and beneficiaries′ welfare suggest that they carry significant social responsibilities over and above fulfilling important economic and financial functions in and between financial markets.4  \n\nIf financial institutions are also organizations, how are we to conceptualize organizations? March and Simon's (1958) answer to the question has had a long-lived influence in the field of organization studies. They began with a distinction between so-called formal' and informal organizations, supposing that the former have distinctive legal forms and boundaries that provide them with an identity. By implication, informal organizations are loose arrangements between people committed to collaboration and cooperation. March and Simon focus on the former. This is consistent with treatments of financial institutions as organizations, though we are mindful of the role that informal organizations can play in promoting institutional innovation (see Chapter 10). March and Simon suggested, in a strategy that Bowles (2004) also used, that it is easier to explain what an organization is by reference to examples. Their exemplars were US Steel, the Red Cross, and the New York State Highways Authority. By implication, organizations can be found in the private sector, the not-for-profit sector, and in government.  \n\nTheir approach to the study of organizations broke with traditional studies of bureaucracies in a number of ways. Although not directly reported in their book and subsequent research, it is evident that they were keen observers of the life of 'real organizations—-how they arrange their activities, frame their decision-making, and evolve. Their work, along with that of their colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University, sought to characterize the internal logic of large organizations. As the research programme progressed, they framed the study of organizations around routines and constraints, eschewing an optimization framework focused on rational agents in favour of behaviour in context (Simon 1956). This logic was expressed in a variety of ways, most obviously in Cyert and March's (1963) behavioural theory of the firm. Five key issues animated Cyert and March's analytical framework of organizations, namely their internal coordination, the motivations of their employees and participants, conflict, the assignment of decision rights within them, and innovation. These issues also underpin our book.  \n\nMarch and Simon (1958: 4) took as given what constitutes an organization and its attributes. Their definition is revealing: relying on a biological analogy, they suggested that ‘organizations are assemblages of interacting human beings? with a high [degree of] specificity of structure and coordination within organizations—as contrasted with the diffuse and variable relations among organizations and among unorganized individuals'. We notice that this definition makes no reference to markets and hierarchies, the principal-agent problem, or the purpose or intended outcomes of organizations. These issues were brought to the fore by those who followed in their wake, notably Williamson (1975) on transaction costs, Lancaster (1975) on the objective function of firms, and Meckling and Jensen (1976) and Jensen (1993) on the principal-agent problem. Most importantly, March and Simon do not refer to the distinctive attributes of certain types of organizations. Later work sympathetic to their framework recognized that certain forces, including ^mimetic mechanisms, tend, as Scott (2008) suggested, to induce isomorphism within specific fields of endeavour.  \n\nEconomic theories of organizations are based on the nexus between means and ends. Put slightly differently, given certain goals and objectives, it is assumed that economic agents choose an organizational form and related decision-making mechanisms to optimize those goals and objectives. By contrast, March and Simon and those inspired by their framework looked past organizational form and related decision-making mechanisms and sought to understand how, within those parameters, organizations go about their business and adapt (more or less) to changes in the external environment. If the environment in which a certain type of organization operates is stable and rewards routine practice, then the fit-for-purpose issue can be put aside in favour of a solely internal perspective. This is hardly the case for organizations like financial institutions, which operate in contemporary financial markets. As we noted, risk and uncertainty are ever present-—-because of the costs and consequences of dealing with risk and uncertainty, there is a premium on innovation, whether in organizational decision-making or in the actual form and functions of organizations.  \n\nThe costs and consequences of organizational inertia were the subjects of Jensen's (1993) critique of the performance of major American corporations, and the theoretical frameworks of the time that failed to grasp the significance of global economic integration. For Jensen, the key issue was the entrenchment of senior managers more concerned about their prerogatives than about sustaining the adaptive potential of their organizations. He also suggested that senior managers were not nearly as sensitive as they should have been to the interests of shareholders who bore the brunt of financial markets discounting the shareholder value. His solution was to re-establish a connection between senior manager compensation and shareholder value, relying on financial markets to impose discipline on corporate strategy and decision-making. Whether or not this was an effective or desirable innovation is widely debated. For our purposes, it is apparent that the entrenchment of senior managers in financial institutions insulated from market competition can have significant long-term costs for beneficiaries and participants.  \n\n# ORGANIZATIONS, NETWORKS, AND RESOURCES  \n\nBeginning with the issue of intermediation allowed us to locate the objects of our study (asset owners of various types, including pension funds and sovereign wealth funds) at the interface between savers and investors. The related academic research supposes that certain types of financial institutions are best placed to sustain the relationship between decentralized savers and the myriad investment opportunities available at home and abroad. This makes it easy to draw an analogy between banks and asset owners, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, in relation to this particular function—see Mayer and Vives (1993) on the logic of intermediation. Having established the status of financial institutions, we were able to erect a bridge between these types of institutions and their organizational forms. Nonetheless, there are significant differences between banks and asset owners, particularly with regard to how they organize the process that produces risk-adjusted rates of returns.  \n\nA key difference between banks and asset owners is in the degree to which banks hold a wide range of services and functions internally, while both large and small asset owners tend to outsource many tasks and functions. In the interests of distinguishing between these two types of financial institutions rather than making a profound statement of fact, it could be said that, to reap the benefits of holding clients across a wide variety of transactions, banks tend to internalize services and functions. By this logic, banks seek to sell services to their account holders, for they recognize that the margins on core activities are low relative to the premiums they can charge for more specialized services. Asset owners, by contrast, normally provide just one ^product'—a risk-adjusted rate of return on AUM distributed to beneficiaries and participants according to their shares of AUM. However, there are other related services, including reporting on performance, providing information on investment options, and, in some cases, providing a platform through which participants make their own choices.  \n\nIf banks sound like complex organizations and asset owners like simple ones, missing from this account are the various tasks and functions that go into producing a risk-adjusted rate of return. By convention, asset owners tend to outsource many of the tasks and functions needed to frame and implement an investment strategy. An archetypical organizational model is centred on a small controlling hub served by an extensive network of providers, each bound to the hub by a commercial contract that specifies the terms and conditions under which the provider produces the nominated service. By convention, it is assumed that a hub-and-spokes organization provides the hub control over each element or component in the production of risk-adjusted rates of return on AUM. As we explain in the book, it is widely assumed that this type of organization allows the controlling hub to minimize the costs of service provision by virtue of a threat that, should service providers shirk their responsibilities, the hub is able to terminate service contracts and employ other providers.  \n\nThis is a highly stylized account of asset owners. It matches the argument that different types of organizations tend to be more similar within than between sectors; see, for example, Hannan and Freeman (1989) on organizational ecology. At the same time, there are banks that utilize a hub-and-spokes mode of organization and there are cases of asset owners choosing to insource rather than outsource. Whereas March and Simon and those who have followed in their wake focus on the internal logic of organizations, running in parallel has been a rather different perspective. In short, organizational form can be seen as an issue of competitive strategy as well as a response to the costs and benefits of different types of organizational strategies, including insourcing as opposed to outsourcing. Baker et al. (2001, 2002) have characterized the latter issue in terms of 'make or buy', or, to put it differently, whether to produce the service or set of services needed to create the final product within the organization (make), or to purchase the service or set of services from external providers (buy).  \n\nCoase's (1937) analytical framework has been revived by scholars seeking to understand how and why firms develop over time and space, grow in size but then unbundle their activities, sometimes internalize functions and at other times externalize them. One way or another, the boundaries are blurred between what March and Simon assumed to be stand-alone organizations and those, albeit related ones, that are intimately bound to a dominant or host organization or set of organizations. Coase's insight on the make-or-buy phenomenon has been developed in a number of ways, being represented, for example, in Oliver Williamson's (1975) distinction between markets and hierarchies. More recently, this issue has been reconceptualized in terms of networks, supply chains, and global production platforms. There are various ways of tackling these themes. Benkler (2002) develops an economic sociology of exchange and information networks; Grossman and Helpman (2004, 2005) integrate the economics of outsourcing with the patterns of international trade; and Coe and Yeung (2015) provide the definitive geography of global supply chains and production platforms.  \n\nIt is worth noting that Coase, March, and Simon shared a number of common concerns, even if their respective approaches appear different. For Coase, the driving force behind the establishment and growth of the firm was the entrepreneur. In his analysis, property rights gave the entrepreneur the authority to set the agenda and the power needed to command others to carry it through. For March and Simon, there was no controlling central figure or person in authority able to exert control over the entire organization. In their world, authority and power were contested and conflict identified as an everpresent threat to the coherence of organizations. Coase acknowledged the significance of the issue but bypassed it, whereas March and Simon brought it to the centre of their analytical framework. In both cases, the coordination of organizations was the key issue, even if Coase was able to invoke a golden rule whereby diminishing returns to scale placed an upper limit on the size of firms. Issues of power, coordination, and organizational size are also evident in recent research on the organization of firms in the global economy (Helpman et al.2008).  \n\nLike March and Simon, the model of the firm that Coase expounded was the product of close observation of the world around him. However, it is important to notice the differences. Coase systematically explained his knowledge and understanding of the growth and organizational development of firms in British cities prior to the Second World War. In this respect, his world was not that different from the world of‘industrial districts’ that Alfred Marshall described in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By contrast, March and Simon focused on American corporate capitalism, which was a product of wartime industrial policy, managed development, and sustained economic growth in the 1950s. Globalization at first empowered major American corporations and then came to haunt them when overseas competitors began to infiltrate the domestic markets. As offshore markets developed and as communication technologies expanded their geographical reach, American companies responded to heightened competition at home by dissembling their production systems functionally and spatially. In effect, competitive pressures forced corporations to become more adept at managing themselves, including adapting their organizational forms and functions.  \n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that there was a revolution in how organizations were conceptualized. Simplistic ideas of settled organizational form and functions were left behind in favour of analytical frameworks that treated them as strategic variables. Attention has shifted from the study of organizations with well-defined boundaries to the study of the capabilities and resources available to senior managers (Helfat et al. 2007). At issue is the management of related tasks and functions within, between, and among organizations, which complement and compete with one another for a share of the value in sectors and industries. Throughout our book, we are mindful of the capabilities and resources available to the senior managers of financial institutions, situating the make-or-buy issue in the context of the ability of senior managers to realize their ambitions.  \n\n# BUILDING BLOCKS  \n\nWith a view to appreciating what follows in the book, in this section we identify the intellectual building blocks that underpin our analytical framework. Chapter by chapter, these building blocks will become familiar to organization theorists and practitioners alike. A number of distinctive elements or components to these building blocks, however, require recognition from the outset and, in summary terms, these are set out as follows.  \n\nA crucial building block is a model of how financial institutions like asset owners are governed and managed. The ultimate owners of an institution's AUM are the participants and beneficiaries of the institution (Morrison and Wilhelm 2008). Typically, the governing boards of these institutions represent the interests of the participants and beneficiaries, frequently nominated or elected because of their affiliations rather than their financial skills and expertise. More often than not, participants and beneficiaries are unable to exercise exit, voice, or loyalty. By design, the governing boards of these institutions fulfil these functions. The governing boards are also the employers of the senior executives charged with the responsibility of conceiving and implementing the asset owners’ investment strategies. In short, principals’ are silent and remote and ‘representatives’ are those with whom they have an affinity protect their interests; the latter, in turn, employ ‘agents′ to make good on their best interests. Senior managers then either outsource or insource the production of risk-adjusted rates of return subject to the approval of governingboards.  \n\nSetting the target risk-adjusted rate of return is the responsibility of governing boards, subject to fiduciary duty, the beneficiaries? underlying interests, and the organization's capabilities and resources. We could assume that there is a close match between the chosen target—the beneficiaries? interests—and the capacity of the organization to realize it. In fact, experience shows that target rates of return are often poorly specified and inadequate in terms of providing senior managers with a mandate to manage the investment process. Furthermore, an organizational form and an inherited set of functions that are inconsistent with rate-of-return objectives can encumber managers (Clark and Urwin 2008a). The persistence of such mismatches can be explained in a variety of ways. First, governing boards may have no incentive to change organizational form and functions. Second, these institutions may be poorly resourced, notwithstanding their responsibilities. Third, financial markets may be so unpredictable that target rates of return are inconsistent and misconceived in terms of the market environment (Clark 2014).  \n\nIn setting targets and producing rates of return, financial institutions rely on three types of assets. Human capital, namely skills and expertise, and the organization's decision-making procedures are important “intangible’ assets. The electronic infrastructure that collects, distributes, and analyses market information is a fundamentally important ‘tangible' asset. An institution's human capital can be of high quality, with a level of commitment that matches its goals and objectives. Equally, an institution's human capital could be relatively poor, and subject to a set of incentives and sanctions inconsistent with its goals and objectives. An institution may be well managed through decision-making protocols and procedures that enhance the performance of the investment management process. Then again, this need not be the case. Likewise, the electronic infrastructure of an organization can underpin employees? skills and expertise and facilitate investment decision-making. Yet, this is not always or everywhere the case. The participants and beneficiaries of an institution bear the costs and consequences of inadequate human capital, poor decision-making procedures, and antiquated information systems.  \n\nThroughout, our analysis plays off the significance of these three types of assets. We also refer to organizations’ capabilities and resources, where the former can be defined in terms of the capacity of an organization to get things done and the latter refers to what is available within an organization to facilitate decision-making. There is some overlap between capabilities and resources in that the capacity to get things done relies on having the resources to do so (Helfat et al. 2007). We are mindful of our experience in this regard where, for example, it has been found that some financial institutions are able to get things done at a level of sophistication not expected given the resources available. Effective senior managers adapt to their environments, in some cases compensating for inadequate resources by varying the form and functions of their institution in relation to what is available outside the organization. We are also mindful that financial institutions are often resource poor but staffed by motivated individuals whose professional careers and reputations are dependent upon getting things done within a resourceconstrained environment.  \n\nA key strategic decision is whether to produce the target rate of return within the organization or through the combination of external suppliers from the market for financial services. The make-or-buy issue was, for many years, resolved in favour of buying the suite of services needed to produce the target rate of return. The hub-and-spokes model of organization may provide the board and senior executives with the power and authority (respectively) to coordinate the processes of choosing external suppliers, negotiating contracts, and monitoring performance. In the final resort, the institution's capabilities and resources (augmented by consultants) determine the number of external providers and how frequently they are changed. Indeed, consultants have played a very important role in framing and implementing investment strategy. In these ways, intermediation has dominated the industry. More recently, however, larger asset owners have varied the mix between make and buy by introducing in-house functions related to the determination of investment strategy and its implementation.  \n\nNotice the way in which we represent the make-or-buy decision. Being a deliberate strategic decision made by an institution's board, it seeks to affect the organization's form as well as its functions. In doing so, it is a decision that affects the boundaries of an organization, what is inside and outside of an organization, and those aspects of the organization that are subject to employment contracts as opposed to service ones. We do not assume, and there is no evidence to suggest we should, the broader proposition that the boundaries of organizations in the sector are infinitely malleable. As in any organization, management entrenchment, resource budgets, and ongoing commitments inside and outside the organization limit make-or-buy options over the short and long term. In any event, the power and authority needed to manage the insourcing process and the resulting organization can be so significant that boards and senior managers may place limits on what they ^make' so as to protect their status as well as their future options. Reintermediation via selected partnerships and commitments is a strategic response to the probable costs associated with a wholly insourced strategy.  \n\nThroughout the book, we are mindful of the ever-present contests for power between boards and senior managers over the choice of organizational forms and functions, just as we are mindful of contests for power between senior managers and investment professionals. Given the premium on human capital in the industry, and the reliance of investment institutions on star performers by asset class and across the (internal and/or external) suppliers that make up an institution's investment programme, it is inevitable that insourcing places a premium on organizational performance. Realizing the advantages of insourcing over outsourcing depends on the effective coordination between different parts of the organization and on the authority of senior managers to make timely and effective decisions with respect to the institution's goals and objectives. By contrast, outsourcing carries with it the implication that the senior managers of an institution can vary the mix of external suppliers, relying on competition between suppliers for mandates to impose discipline on the market. However, the marketplace may be highly stratified and dominated by a limited number of suppliers.  \n\nUnderwriting insourcing, outsourcing, and hybrid models that combine both is the theory and practice of contract. At one level, contract is entirely commonplace, being itself one of the most important institutions of modern capitalism. Contract can be seen as both a practice and a formal agreement subject to the costs of negotiation and enforcement (Greif 2006). In some cases, contracts are complete in the sense that these documents fully specify the obligations and commitments binding the parties together whatever transpires (Bolton and Dewatripont 2005). More often than not, however, contracts are incomplete in the sense that, whatever their formal legal status, they function as frameworks rather than recipe books for cooperation and implementation with ready-made options for exit should either party wish to terminate such a relationship. In our case, contracts are important across two dimensions—within organizations (employment contracts) and between organizations (service contracts). Given the scope and depth associated with intermediation in the global financial services industry, it should be apparent that contract is an important element in the process of producing risk-adjusted rates of return.  \n\nIt is evident that contract is embedded in organization theory, including Coase's (1937) theory of the firm, Williamson's (1975) theory of transaction costs, and Grossman and Helpman's (2004, 2005) theory of outsourcing and offshoring. However, attempts have been made to distinguish between the norms and conventions underwriting commercial relationships, and the formal edifice of contract that carries with it legally codified obligations and commitments (see, for example, Macneil (1981) and, more recently, Bathelt and Gluckler (2011) on relational conceptions of commercial exchange and transactions). In our treatment, we emphasize the processes and practices associated with contracting, whether inside or outside organizations. Whereas there is merit in recognizing that commercial relationships are bound together by societal expectations, we suggest that these types of relationships are, more often than not, framed in the shadow of law. Likewise, we suggest that the evident trust between parties to contracts in the financial services industry and other industries is made possible by the threat of law.  \n\nThe final, but perhaps most important, building block underpinning our analysis is recognition of the distinctive environment in which financial institutions operate—global financial markets that are subject to risk and uncertainty. As indicated in the Introduction, we distinguish between risk, which is typically framed by reference to expectations based on experience, and uncertainty, which allows for events and circumstances that fundamentally stop our models integrating the past, present, and future. We recognize that the boundary between risk and uncertainty varies over time, especially if we look at the near future in relation to the long term. We also recognize that financial markets function in space and time—financial institutions have home jurisdictions; they are subject to home bias in terms of their investment strategies; and they frame expectations on experience that is itself anchored in a market or set of markets. One of the most important developments of the past twenty-five years has been the realization that ambitious target rates of return must inevitably take into account the opportunities on the margins ofmarkets.  \n\nHere, then, is one of the key challenges facing Western financial institutions in the twenty-first century. These institutions relied on well-functioning markets, sustained by shared investment practices and expectations, and underpinned by regulatory institutions with a record of success in dampening irrational exuberance (Shiller 2005). Over the past couple of decades, doubts have been raised about the underlying stability of these markets. Furthermore, Western financial institutions have sought an investment premium, extending their reach to markets not nearly as transparent or efficient as their home ones. At issue is the degree to which financial institutions as organizations are capable of adapting to the new realities in home markets. Equally important is the degree to which financial institutions as organizations are able to be effective long-term investors in far-off markets that require new ways of organizing the governance and management of these institutions. Whereas much of the academic literature is concerned with the challenges of investing over time, we show that investing over space and time requires organizational innovation.  \n\n# NOTES  \n\n1. Readers will note that the title of this chapter references Scott's (2008) book of the same title (excluding the subtitle). We are pleased to refer to his work, in part because he is a valued colleague and in part because of the clarity of his treatise. As will become clear, our purpose here is rather different from his—-we are concerned to explain institutions as organizations whereas his goal was to bring clarity to the theoretical debate about the role of institutions in society.   \n2.

Although historically focused on banks and their default risks, the board extended its reach to multifunctional financial entities like Morgan Stanley, investment banks like Lehman Brothers, and insurance companies like American International Group (AIG) (Geithner 2014).   \n4. By virtue of statute and regulation, certain types of institutions, including financial ones, may be required to have specific governance structures and systems, as well as certain management functions. In addition, regulators may require certain types of decision-making procedures along with formal consultation with various shareholders and/or stakeholders.  \n\n5. In many respects, members of the Carnegie School had the advantage of being able to observe and be involved in large organizations in the Pittsburgh region, a city that then attracted the headquarters of many industrial corporations. There has been surprisingly little commentary on this aspect of their research, although it can be glimpsed in Williamson's (1975) theory of transaction costs. Subsequently, aspects of their research procedures were formalized by Clark's (1998)‘close dialogue' and Helper's (2000) “field studies'.  \n\n### 3  \n\n### The Architecture of Information  \n\nAs suggested in Chapter 1, the map of finance was underwritten by the principles of finance and, in particular, the efficient market hypothesis (W6jcik et al. 2013). At base, this doctrine is framed by three assumptions or propositions (Litterman et al. 2004). First, the efficiency of financial markets depends on the volume and integrity of relevant information. Second, market prices fully reflect the available information, so promote the efficient allocation of resources between competing opportunities. Third, to the extent that information asymmetries exist, the search for market advantage will, inevitably, price those corners of the market leaving little opportunity for consistent abnormal returns. Even so, it has long been recognized that market agents do not have the same capacity to process information or, for that matter, make sense of information in a timely manner. The very idea of informationally efficient markets has been subject to trenchant criticism (Grossman and Stiglitz 1980).  \n\nIn this book, we show that the scope of financial institutions depends on the processing of information internal to institutions, and between institutions and their market providers. Our concern is about the governance of financial institutions, with particular attention to the relationships between senior managers and portfolio managers in the context of strategic choices about insourcing, outsourcing, and offshoring. It was noted in Chapter 2 that these types of organizations have three kinds of intangible assets—human capital, institution-specific decision-making procedures, and the infrastructure for processing information. In this chapter, we focus on the design and management of financial institutions? information systems. We focus on the interface between geographically spread financial institutions, centralized financial markets, and return-seeking investment strategies on the margins of markets.  \n\nThe next section of the chapter, The Information-Industry Nexus', provides a brief account of the growth of the global finance industry, emphasizing its autonomy from industrial capitalism. We argue that the premium on local knowledge was systematically discounted over the second half of the twentieth century by the intellectual apparatus accompanying portfolio management. This is followed by a discussion of the theory of the firm, and our own assessment of the applicability of this logic to financial institutions and to economic geography more generally (Dicken 2011; Taylor and Asheim 2001). Throughout, we emphasize the importance of information in the finance industry, the dependence of the industry on the valuation, and deployment of information within and outside financial institutions through return-seeking investment strategies. It is also emphasized that these institutions face an increasingly hostile market environment, which has prompted investment in systems of information processing aimed at exploiting opportunities on the margins of global financial markets.  \n\nInspired by Storper and Venables (2004) and the distinction made by Bathelt and Gluickler (2011) to the effect that information flows occur through either 'pipelines? (systems of information distribution) or buzz (informal networks), in the penultimate section of the chapter, namely “Investment on the Margin', we focus on the information-processing attributes of investment strategies aimed at realizing superior rates of return on the margins of markets. In the conclusion, we consider the implications of our analysis of the imperatives driving a representative investment institution and how this type of entity might deal with the emerging realities of twenty-first-century global financial markets. In large part, this chapter is analytical, focused on principles and practices rather than case studies of particular institutions in their home jurisdictions. It is arguable that financial institutions share with more conventional types of firms the same market imperatives—-including the costs and benefits of insourcing as opposed to outsourcing and offshoring. However, financial institutions operate in a quite distinctive environment with particular factors driving behaviour. Articulating these imperatives is the goal of this chapter.  \n\n# THE INFORMATION-INDUSTRY NEXUS  \n\nFor the first fifty years of the twentieth century, it was reasonable to suppose that banks, relying on large corporations for their business, financed industrial capitalism. From the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, this ^model' had a distinctive geographical footprint that persisted in many countries through to the second half of the twentieth century (Martin 1999). Closely held corporations served by local banking institutions, which together controlled large parts of national economies, represented the dominant model of continental European capitalism (Clark and Wojcik 2007; Dore 2000). In the Anglo-American world, however, household saving was increasingly tied to workplace pension schemes, which assumed an institutional form (and function) separate from their sponsors (Clark 2000; Dixon 2012). The disconnection between bank-led industrial capitalism and third-party, savings-led financial capitalism was evident in the United Kingdom and the United States by the mid-1970s (witness the Wilson Report 1980).  \n\nFor much of the twentieth century, the asset allocation policies of pension funds, insurance companies, and related institutions were formulaic and subject to government regulation. There were limits on equity and overseas investment and, in many jurisdictions, these institutions were required to hold a certain portion of their assets in domestic government bonds. These restrictions were lifted by Anglo-American governments through the 1980s, although some US states maintained restrictions for longer and, in a number of cases, continue to do so (Mitchell et al. 20oo). These restrictions were also commonplace in continental Europe until the introduction of the euro, when most were eliminated. Through to the big bang′ of 1986, UK financial institutions pursued rather rudimentary investment strategies hemmed in by regulation and accepted convention. As the constraints were lifted, and market liberalization empowered a new form of financial capitalism, these institutions took aim at the remnants of industrial capitalism.  \n\nUnderwriting the deregulation of financial institutions and markets was a revolution in financial theory and practice. One thread of this revolution was the widespread adoption of modern portfolio theory (MPT) (Markowitz 1952a). In conjunction with a liberal conception of fiduciary duty, MPT facilitated a switch in risk assessment from individual investments to the investment portfolios of institutions. In a sense, the decision of whether or not to invest in a particular security (company stock or government bond) was replaced with an assessment of the risk profiles of asset classes and how those ^summed-up' to the entire portfolio. A second thread in the revolution was adoption of the effcient markets hypothesis (EMH), which encouraged the belief that traded securities were properly priced and that the risk and return profiles of securities could be meaningfully projected into the future. The neoclassical theory of finance provided a recipe book for portfolio investment (Ho and Lee 2004) and, arguably, the global financial crisis (GFC).  \n\nIn effect, the premium on local knowledge was discounted. In its place, financial products were developed, representing segments or slices of asset classes with distinctive industry and geographical characteristics. Instead of trading a handful of company securities based on expert knowledge or some informational advantage, financial institutions were offered products that carried with them risk and return characteristics based on historical trends. The design of these products was, and remains, dependent on simulating their underlying properties, informed by theories of market movement and crosscorrelations with other financial instruments. Instead of a premium on local knowledge, the premium has been on product design and performance, in which relationships between product providers and consumers have replaced relationships with “insiders'. If buzz is important, it is framed as a matter of the rate of return preferences and the expectations of product purchasers.  \n\nTwo other aspects of the financial market are crucial to this chapter. It is self-evident that London and New York dominate their respective financial \"hinterlands'. Although both have been nationally and internationally significant for many years (centuries in the case of London), their current hegemony is owed to three intersecting forces or market dynamics. Most obviously, both markets have benefited from the public listing of corporate and government securities (including continental Europe). As the volume of financial assets grew through workplace pension saving, the benefits of public listing were accompanied by discounting the power of major shareholders, and the rise of ‘universal owners’ who were content to remain in the minority and largely silent (Hawley and Williams 2007). Moreover, with rather weak and immature financial markets dominating many developing economies, London and New York became magnets for European and international portfolio managers (Clark 2002).  \n\nNotwithstanding the reliance of financial institutions on these and other, smaller markets, these same institutions have also sought to manage their relationships with geographically dispersed clients. Whether by inertia or the continuing significance of client-financial institution relationships, financial markets have acted as giant vacuum engines, using pipelines to collect assets from dispersed sources and channel them to centralized switch points in the global economy. As indicated in Chapter 2, this has been made possible by the development of market intermediaries such as custodian banks, asset managers, and third-party brokers, which locate close to financial markets in order to manage the placement, switching, and distribution process. These pipelines have been so successful, in fact, that many financial institutions have largely given up their own systems in favour of market intermediaries. This has allowed sponsors to remain remotely located’ relative to global and national financial markets.  \n\n# INSTITUTIONAL SIZE AND SCOPE  \n\nMuch of the literature on the size and scope of the modern firm begins with Coase's (1937) seminal paper. Coase sought to explain how and why firms internalize tasks and functions relative to the market for services. Utilizing standard microeconomic tools (for example, average and marginal costs), he was able to show that firms grow in size to the extent that the costs associated with increasing size (including complexity) are more than offset by the benefits (including flexibility) that accrue to entrepreneur coordinators when they hold tasks and functions internal to the firm. His argument was based on a rather inchoate theory of the employment contract (cf. Hart and Moore 1999). In effect, he distinguished between what modern theorists of the firm term (internal) relational or incomplete contracts and (external) discrete or complete contracts (Macneil 1980; see also Baker et al. 2002).1  \n\nWhen augmented by reference to the separation of owners from managers, which is characteristic of modern firms (Easterbrook and Fischel 1991), transaction costs (Williamson 1975), and sunk costs (Clark and Wrigley 1997), Coase provides the beginnings of an analytical rationale for the size and scope of industrial enterprises. Nonetheless, his conception of the firm is rather idealized given the coexistence of different types of employees subject to different incentive systems inside and outside the somewhat arbitrary boundaries of modern firms. The limits of this particular perspective are obvious. For example, the claimed distinction between relational and discrete contracts seems to favour a (large) firm-centred arrangement of production and supply where, in fact, other arrangements could be just as desirable. Jensen (1993) contended that relational contracts are often self-defeating because they reinforce the inertia of entrenched managers against the ever-changing circumstances of competitive markets.  \n\nIt is arguable that the Internet, through inexpensive and virtually instantaneous electronic communication networks like Twitter and Facebook, has profoundly altered the terms of trade. The comparative advantage is now found in the decentralized networks of suppliers and producers who drive down the costs of production and promote innovation (Benkler 2006). Whereas Coase emphasized the costs of finding relevant market information on potential suppliers, as well as potential market opportunities, as crucial impediments to outsourcing tasks and functions, this type of information is increasingly available at a click. The retention of production at a centralized location is less important than hitherto assumed. Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008: 1978) suggest that 'revolutionary advances in transportation and communications technology have weakened the link between labour specialization and geographic concentration, making it increasingly viable to separate tasks in time and space'.  \n\nGene Grossman and his colleagues also acknowledge that search costs are important, reflecting the analytical logic of Coase (1937) if not his assessment of what is possible in space and time. Grossman and Helpman (2005) suggested that outsourcing requires firms to find suitable partners with expertise consistent with their requirements. They need to convince them to ^customize? their production systems to be consistent with the systems of the ‘home' company. They must also be responsive to the terms and conditions of agreed contracts and to changes in those contracts in response to markets. By their account, firms seek distant partners that are simultaneously committed to the firm and are flexible with respect to unanticipated changes in the terms of agreed relationships. Grossman and Helpman suggest that finding these types of partners may be difficult—large and deep markets (cities) are deemed preferable to small and thin ones.  \n\nLargely ignored in their analysis are issues related to the governance of the home firm and how this intersects with the governance of networks of decentralized suppliers. At one level, they suggest that the home firm's preference for flexible external networks means that the relationship between the firm and its extended networks may be best conceptualized in terms of incomplete contracts. Suppliers are functionally part of the firm and could be treated as such, even if they are located outside its formal boundaries and outside the borders of the home firm's jurisdiction. Even so, if suppliers are located in large urban markets, the home firm may attempt to control these suppliers via discrete and complete contracts rather than relational and incomplete contracts. However, the search costs involved in switching suppliers may be low, given existing knowledge of other suppliers gleaned through initial searches for current partners. In a similar manner, suppliers may well resist customizing their production systems, given the possibilities of switching to other firms that offer more advantageous conditions.2  \n\nThe control of suppliers or partners is a significant issue and has two dimensions. In Chapter 4, we distinguish between the authority of senior managers and the mechanisms that coordinate the firm and its production systems (internal, external, and offshore). Much of the literature on the digital economy assumes that the relationships between firms, partners, and suppliers are bilateral (Pareto optimal) and often short in duration. By contrast, much of the literature on the modern firm assumes that authority is crucial for setting goals and objectives, just as the efficient management of the component parts that make up the production and sale of the final product is crucial in realizing those objectives. By this logic, authority is a necessary condition for effective coordination. In the absence of an active owner, authority may be highly contested inside and outside the firm. The allocation of “decision rights’ and how they are exercised is vital for the functional performance of firms.  \n\nRecognizing the governance costs associated with dispersed networks of suppliers, Grossman and Helpman (2005) locate authority with the home firm. They suppose that suppliers operating at a distance are controlled by complete contracts that stipulate the nature and performance of their production. Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) distinguish between suppliers according to their specific tasks and functions, believing that detailed rulebooks or sets of instructions can govern suppliers and the configuration of production. By this assessment, it is efficient to offshore tasks and functions when the home institution is able to orchestrate the coordination of tasks and functions, when there is an ease of substitution between suppliers, and when there are complementarities between suppliers and home production systems.  \n\n# GOVERNANCE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  \n\nTheories of the modern firm are, more often than not, based on entities that make and sell commodities. The analytical logic relies on tangible or physical assets. The coordination of labour and capital is a crucial task of senior managers, recognizing that production can take place at home or offshore from the firm's notional headquarters. Notwithstanding absent or silent owners, authority (decision rights) over the coordination of the firm is located with senior managers and is distributed down through the firm by virtue of an established hierarchy of roles and responsibilities. If markets are an alternative to hierarchies (Williamson 1975), the choice of markets over insourcing is presumably exercised by senior managers on behalf of their owners.  \n\nBy contrast, financial institutions do not make and sell commodities. They produce a rate of return via decisions made about the appropriate mix of asset classes and the implementation or execution of investment strategies through portfolio managers (Campbell and Viceira 2002). Financial institutions rely on two intangible assets—human capital and the process of decision-making— and one tangible one, namely a data and information system. As in other types of firms, owners are either absent or silent. Although one might think that this would give senior managers a great deal of authority over the production process, because there is a premium on human capital, the exercise of authority is mediated by the need to sustain cooperation between senior managers and portfolio managers (see Chapter 4). As Rajan and Zingales (2001) note, flat hierarchies are characteristic of human-capital-intensive industries (see also Teece 2000).  \n\nHere, we suggest that the governance ^problem’ of large financial institutions is framed by reference to authority and coordination (the powers and responsibilities of senior managers) and the skills and expertise (human capital) of portfolio managers. Skills are distinguished from talent in the sense that the former are owed to formal training and education relevant to responsibilities, while the latter reflects domain-specific knowledge and experience. As such, the tasks and functions of portfolio managers are specialized and distinguishable, for example, by asset class, style of investment, industry, and geographical association. Furthermore, portfolio managers run teams of similarly specialized individuals, binding team members together by reference to common performance objectives, incentive programmes, and prospective opportunities (inside and outside the institution). There is a market for talented portfolio managers and their teams (see Che and Yoo (2001) on the logic of team-based systems of production and Rosen (1981) on the market for ‘super? talent).  \n\nAs noted, the product produced by financial institutions can be conceptualized as the planned risk-adjusted rate of return on assets under management (AUM). This rate of return target can be seen as representative of the goals and objectives of the entire institution, or it can be distinguished or differentiated by reference to the goals and objectives of the institution's clients. Some institutions, like pension funds, have a single target rate of return. Other types of financial institutions bring together a myriad of clients each with their own target rates of return. Even so, there are significant incentives for clients and producers to pool the available AUM to reap economies of scale in the management process, the governance and oversight of investment, and in the nature and volume of transactions in financial markets. For argument's sake, we assume that our representative institution has a single rate of return target.  \n\nWe assume that the target rate of return is provided to senior managers by the client. This may be an explicit mandate or it may be inferred by senior managers, given the long-term commitments of the client. Senior managers then frame the institution's investment strategy, focusing on the optimal mix of asset classes that should achieve the target rate of return over some preferred time horizon. Given the volume of AUM, tranches of assets are allocated to the various asset classes that make up the optimal investment portfolio. Very simply, assuming AUM of f100, f50 might be allocated to domestic equities, f30 to government bonds, f15 to tangible assets, and f5 held as cash. Assuming the institution has the relevant portfolio managers, this allocation provides assets to the investment teams within the institution to manage on behalf of the ultimate clients or sponsors. Senior managers view their investment teams as complimentary tasks and functions. However, portfolio managers typically view one another as rivals for the allocation of investment funds. Reputation is based, in part, on the volume of AUM.  \n\nWe also assume that senior managers either allocate funds to third parties that provide asset-specific investment products (for example, active domestic equity or passive domestic equity), or they allocate funds to their own portfolio managers to 'make′ products (returns) that mimic or are superior to the available products in the market. If they outsource, the institution's managers engage in searches for external providers; here, they focus on the relative performance of managers and monitor the performance of selected providers. If they ^make’ their own products (insource), their performance (in terms of costs and rates of return) is, inevitably, judged against what is available in the market. A successful outsourcing institution has senior managers with skills, experience, and judgement consistent with those they hire. Likewise, successful insourcing institutions have internal portfolio managers with the talent and skills at least equal to those who might be hired in the external market.3  \n\nWhether it makes or buys financial products, our representative institution relies on financial markets to realize its target rate of return. Directly or indirectly, it holds the traded securities of companies, governments, other investment houses, and related synthetic products. One way or another, its investment performance depends on the flow of market information. Senior managers setting the institution's strategic asset allocation rely on data on the long-term performance of asset classes (separately and together). Senior managers seeking to determine whether to make or buy portfolio investment products rely on data on the costs and market performances of competing options. Managers seeking to hire external providers rely on data on the market performance of third-party providers. Finally, portfolio managers seeking to realize asset-specific rate of return targets rely on data on market opportunities over the short, medium, and long term.  \n\nThe quality and quantity of information are thus important factors in the effective governance of these institutions. Senior managers seeking to realize the institution's rate of return objectives through its strategic plan and the coordination of portfolio managers? investments have an interest in monitoring portfolio managers’ actions. In part, oversight reinforces a priori agreements about the nature and scope of investment policies, the risks associated with those policies, and how the policies of separate investment teams cohere and complement one another (Clark 2002). This may involve, for example, the daily transmission of information to senior managers on the flow of transactions, current positions against benchmarks, risk profiles, and the nature and status of outstanding positions (bets on market momentum).  \n\nBy this logic, senior managers rely on information to impose their authority on investment teams and ensure that coordination is both effective and consistent over time. Failure, in terms of an oversight or the subversion of information or monitoring systems, can result in a crisis--the so-called 'rogue trader' phenomenon. If this type of failure flows on to other institutions, counterparties, and market makers, it can result in market failure. Therefore, there is a premium on the timely flow and veracity of information internal to the institution, just as there is a premium on access to information on financial markets.  \n\n# THE ARCHITECTURE OF FINANCIALINFORMATION  \n\nOn the supply side of the equation, the financial services industry is concentrated in global, national, and, to a limited extent, regional nodes. Tokyo, Shanghai, London, and New York are the primary international financial nodes, overshadowing national financial centres such as Sydney, Singapore, and Frankfurt, which, in turn, cast large shadows over their respective regional centres such as Melbourne, Manchester, and Munich (Porteous 1999). Institutional consumers of financial services, by contrast, tend to locate within, or adjacent to, national and regional population centres, thus matching the locations of their primary sponsors. Whereas New York, with significant offshoots in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Miami, dominates the US financial services industry, public-sector pension funds are found in every state and in many municipalities.  \n\nThe search for suppliers is a two-way process. Institutions seeking suppliers signal the market about their needs and expectations, while on the other side, potential suppliers signal institutions about their particular attributes and expertise. Conceived in these terms, markets are highly decentralized and information is widely dispersed (Spence 1977). As a result, the search process, negotiation over contracts, and the assessment of actual and potential suppliers can be a costly affair. In the finance industry, however, potential suppliers are not dispersed over time and space, but instead are concentrated in global and national financial centres with offshoots in major regional centres.  \n\nCoase noted that intermediaries can make a difference to search costs, but the problems of time and space remain significant. In the financial services industry, the spatial concentration of potential suppliers is reinforced by co-located market intermediaries whose purpose it is to screen, sort, and recommend relevant suppliers to financial institutions. Intermediaries like Mercer and Willis Towers Watson have become significant for collecting data on market suppliers; they package it in parcels relevant to different types of investment services and then distribute it to institutional consumers of financial services on a timely basis (see Chapter 8). Furthermore, the largest providers of financial services seek to bypass market intermediaries by establishing relationships with the larger financial institutions, thereby absorbing the costs of market intermediation. In some smaller countries dominated by relatively few large financial institutions, intermediation has, in effect, been absorbed.5  \n\nThere are significant economies of scale in the collection, packaging, and distribution of financial market performance data on a 24-hour/365-day basis. Companies such as Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg dominate this segment of the financial services industry, with market performance data distributed to institutional consumers on an almost real-time basis from national and global financial centres. Furthermore, they provide data in large and small bundles with display routines, analytical tools, and routines for sifting and searching data for the most relevant indicators of performance. For financial institutions that have their own internal portfolio managers, Cerulli Associates and Reuters have obviated the need to collect and manage most market data. Indeed, the existence of these types of intermediaries has made portfolio investment-at-a-distance possible in the sense that being located on the margins of Europe relative to London does not appear to carry a price (in terms of access to data that most other market participants hold).  \n\nNotice, however, that data providers on the supply side of the market do not certify the veracity of their products. Their role is to collect, package, and distribute data rather than determine whether the data can be trusted. In any event, in most developed economies, the behaviour of agents and institutions in the financial services industry is regulated by legal principles such as fiduciary duty and/or statute-based rules and regulations regarding honesty and conflicts of interest. Moreover, given the costs and consequences of a failure to observe legal requirements as well as industry norms and conventions, many institutions in the industry have their own audit and compliance departments. Alternatively, in a manner consistent with the practice of intermediation in the industry, this function may be outsourced to specialized independent service providers.  \n\nIn sum, the financial services industry is awash with information. It is distributed through electronic communication networks that resemble pipelines: Bathelt and Gluckler (2011) refer to the ways in which information is distributed through ‘trans-local pipelines' with ‘often predefined goals planned in advance'. To realize their goals and objectives, they distinguish between the unorganized and sometimes spontaneous actions of individual agents seeking one another as part of the process of gathering information (buzz), and the deliberate use of information pipelines by institutions. In the financial services industry, pipelines of information are similar in form and function to what Casson (1997) refers to as channels of communication. Most importantly, we would suggest that the virtues of these pipelines of information are to be found in the ^width of the pipes' (the volume of information that can be communicated) and the ‘speed of the flows’ (real-time access to spatially dispersed market information).?  \n\nFinancial institutions typically share pipelines of information in that they use common service providers to bundle and distribute data. In Figure 3.1, we provide a schematic representation of the information flows inside and outside financial institutions such as pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds. Unless a financial institution is extremely large, these types of entities rely on six elements. These are:  \n\n![](images/ff4f2c299a5fbd8f1c98bdb06ebb414d2b90db78d8b0c6a42d984b182286da81.jpg)  \nFigure 3.1. Financial institutions—pipelines of information Source:Authors  \n\n(i) external pipelines of market data (bottom left-hand side); (ii) the pipelines of custodial banks and related service providers (bottom); (ii)the providers of standardized reporting systems that allow financial institutions to communicate with external managers, receive their reports, and oversee their performance (bottom right-hand side); (iv) the direct communications with brokers and online trading systems via electronic channels of communication (top right-hand side and top left-hand side); (v)the intermediaries that specialize in risk assessment (top left); and, all the while, (vi) the data from portfolio investment providers (top right).  \n\nIn some institutions, external pipelines go through the institution to the relevant function or office. In others, the flow of information is enveloped in an enterprise-wide information system. Given the premium on imposing authority and ensuring coordination between functions, this may result in bespoke or tailor-made networks of communication that are based on industry standards, but modified for the specific circumstances of the institution. At this level, standardized pipelines of information are mediated by the heterogeneity of financial institutions in terms of their histories and geographies (for example, their relationships with sponsors, regulators, and beneficiaries) (see generally Von Hippel 2005). At another level, whether an institution or a sponsor can afford its own information systems typically depends on AUM. Smaller institutions have little option other than to piggyback on external pipelines, while relying on their administrative hierarchies as the frame of reference for electronic reporting. As such, in small funds, buzz may have to compensate for rudimentary channels of electronic communication.  \n\n# INVESTMENT ON THE MARGIN  \n\nOver the past fifteen to twenty years, many institutions have failed to meet their rate of return targets. Discount rates have declined over the past twenty years, systematically reducing the benefits of a balanced portfolio of equities and bonds while, in the case of defined benefit (DB) pension schemes, adding significantly to prospective liabilities. Figure 3.2 displays the monthly discount rates on thirty-year UK government bonds (gilts) since the late 1990s. The precipitous decline in discount rates from the mid-1990s onwards in many developed economies has been argued by some to reflect the benefits of globalization as well as the easing of commodity prices. Just as importantly, the US Fed has used éeasy money' policies to stabilize the US economy in the face of repeated financial crises. The effects of this policy have flowed onto other countries, notably the United Kingdom and emerging markets. One result has been the discounting of returns on savings, and the concomitant search for higher returns in traded and non-traded securities.  \n\n![](images/af616c4fd999d8c7ecc89e3b3c5292367c723e3e640e193a11129f4e2f90bed0.jpg)  \nFigure 3.2. UK monthly thirty-year bond yields, 1996-2016 Source: Authors, Bloomberg  \n\nAnglo-American equity markets have failed to produce, over much the same period, an average rate of return much above 3 per cent (real) per year. The equity-risk premium, so important for investment strategy over the past fifty years (Dimson et al. 2002), has withered. Figure 3.3 displays the gap between assumed yearly rates of return reported for US state pension-fund systems and actual returns on a balanced portfolio of US equities and bonds.7 Many US state government pension institutions assume rates of return in the order of 6 to 8 per cent per year. When looked at over the past ten or so years, realized US portfolio returns have been subject to considerable market volatility, with episodes of high returns followed by episodes of low returns. Equally, there is widespread recognition that the risks associated with an index-based balanced portfolio are much larger than is often appreciated. Shortfalls in target rates of return and growing liabilities threaten the viability of many different types of financial institutions, both public and private. Not surprisingly, institutions have looked for alternatives to make up the difference (see Jones 2012).  \n\nFinancial institutions have sought to realize their rate of return targets by shifting asset allocations towards asset classes quite different from conventional traded equities and debt. One approach has been to invest on the margin, seeking to take advantage of the growth prospects and momentum associated with emerging markets. We refer to three types of strategies towards which funds have gravitated to meet their return objectives. First, funds have sought pipeline extensions using established communication channels and pipelines of information to access geographies previously not included in their investment portfolios. A related strategy involves pipelines and buzz where institutions compensate for imperfect information systems by investing in a market presence that complements existing pipelines. Finally, some institutions have discounted pipelines in favour of buzz, pursuing relationship-intensive investment strategies that are not amenable to management through conventional channels of communication.8  \n\n![](images/2bd0b3a68bd27c7b31fef33b57e218cc4a84fa7542294ef159c03dfee9edbe02.jpg)  \nFigure 3.3. Expected and realized returns Source: Authors  \n\n### Pipeline Extensions  \n\nThe logic behind investing in emerging markets via pipeline extensions is entirely conventional. Working from senior managers’ strategic asset allocations, financial institutions reallocate a portion of their existing AUM to portfolio managers who specialize in emerging markets either internal or external to the organization. If institutions insource, this strategy depends on the availability of relevant information pipelines, the degree to which senior managers can oversee these new responsibilities, and the level of complexity that such strategies add to the institution. Outsourcing is often an easier option, piggybacking as it does on existing network relationships with external portfolio managers. As such, the shift towards emerging markets via pipeline extensions tends not to disrupt internal commitments, while external providers rely on spatially extensive information channels without having to establish new pipelines from scratch. In these circumstances, senior managers can use discrete contracts to govern external providers, rather than negotiate with their own portfolio managers who may be entrenched in their own disciplines.  \n\nWith reference to Figure 3.1, the relevant pipelines connect senior managers to external portfolio managers (and those managers to markets around the world). Senior managers typically utilize benchmarks and related measures of performance to govern external portfolio managers via these pipelines, which also connect them to global data providers. In these ways, pipelines of information reach beyond existing channels of communication through the core markets of the global financial system to peripheral markets. In a sense, this type of information architecture reinforces the pre-eminence of global financial markets as switch points through which information and financial assets flow in a mutually reinforcing manner. Financial institutions without experience or knowledge of emerging markets rely on third-party channels of communication located in global financial centres.  \n\n### Pipelines and Buzz  \n\nA characteristic of both emerging markets and alternative investments is the significance of information asymmetries among market participants and providers. As a result, market pricing does not always reflect underlying value and is subject to unanticipated volatility. The standard techniques used to price risk in developed markets and thereby integrate dispersed traders via pipelines of trading information are known to be ineffective. One response, especially important for emerging markets, has been to establish off-site offices and portfolio investment teams close, or adjacent to, markets deemed important for realizing financial institutions’ rate of return targets. In this manner, financial institutions may insource and offshore the framing and implementation of asset- and market-specific investment strategies. In doing so, this strategy places a premium on control. Consequently, offshore teams may have limited autonomy and remain closely connected to senior managers via proprietary or dedicated pipelines of information and communication that link the home institution with its offshore entities. This is a ‘pipelines and buzz corporate strategy.  \n\nThe success of this approach depends on a number of factors. Obviously, the real-time effectiveness of the control systems and information pipelines connecting the home entity to its offshore sites is a crucial factor. More problematic, perhaps, is the issue of loyalty. That is, the degree to which offsite officers see their career prospects through the lens provided by their home institutions or in local opportunities. If senior managers control their off-site managers with reporting regimes that limit autonomy, it may be difficult to recruit and retain portfolio managers in those markets. If authority is the issue, the home institution may place its own employees at off-site markets on a secondment basis. However, this may, of course, militate against penetrating and holding the attention of the local market networks that are so important for market intelligence (buzz). The alternative is to outsource offshore activities, using either contracts to tie providers to the home institution, or partial ownership of providers to claim a share in local pipelines of information.  \n\n### Buzz  \n\nGiven the risks involved with investing at a distance, Western financial institutions have also sought access to private equity and hedge funds because they are often located near the core centres of the global financial system. These types of financial products are typically accessed on an outsourced basis. Whereas knowledge of the suppliers of these types of products is easily obtained through existing third-party pipelines of information, knowledge of how vendors produce their rates of return is very difficult to obtain using conventional sources. Indeed, the promise of private equity and hedge funds is often found in their proprietary systems of investment management and their access to information not otherwise available to financial institutions. In this respect, buzz has two dimensions and may not be shared with financial institutions before they enter into contractual relationships with desired vendors.  \n\nSuch is the premium on higher rates of return that financial institutions may willingly give up their claim to authority and control over the management of their own internal portfolio managers. In addition, senior managers may be forced to forego contractual terms and conditions typically applied to conventional external fund managers, especially regarding the generation and distribution of information on investment strategy and related proprietary trading systems. At the same time, given that realizing strategic asset allocation goals involves assembling complementary investments, contracts with private equity and hedge fund providers are often accompanied by rulebooks that proscribe certain types of activities, including certain risks that would or could affect the institution's overall risk profile.  \n\nRulebooks can be extensive. For example, they can limit the use of certain kinds of credit and debt instruments (privileging listed equities); they can define permissible levels of leverage and they can provide upper and lower bounds on assumed risks and fund volatility. Rulebooks can exclude certain types of stocks and securities (the object of other portfolio managers) and set time limits on positions taken on stock options. In a similar manner, they can exclude certain industries and geographies, while allocating any risks associated with currency exposures to the portfolio manager. Rulebooks can undermine the authority of the home institution by setting terms for the desired liquidity of investments. They can also set the terms for reporting on risk exposure and the performance of risk control systems, namely the mechanisms whereby breaches of rulebooks are reported to the home institution and the penalties that may be invoked in relation to such reported breaches. In some cases, given that they are less a matter of contract and more a matter of operational management, the home institution can vary the rulebooks at a moment's notice.  \n\nIn these ways, the rulebooks accompanying contracts with the vendors of alternative investments are quite different from those used in commodity supply-chain management. Grossman and Helpman (2005) suggest that the rulebooks accompanying offshoring contracts set the ways in which vendors produce the products desired by the home institution. By contrast, in the financial services industry vendors have significant autonomy over how they produce desired rates of return; the limits imposed by financial institutions seek to protect the authority and the risks borne by clients.  \n\n# CONCLUSIONS  \n\nPipelines of information are important in many industries, not just global financial services (Maskell 2014). The flow of assets to global financial markets, the widespread adoption of the principles of financial theory, and the role of third parties in channelling information have, over the past two decades, reinforced confidence in formal models of governance and investment management. So significant, in fact, has been the development of third-party systems of information processing that it has been possible to talk of an éend of geography’ in financial markets (O'Brien 1992). In this vein, it has been suggested that the information architecture and systems of information flow integrating market players around the world have made the position of financial institutions much less significant in time and space than the global centres of financial trading. This argument matches observations made by economic geographers about the compression of time and space characteristic of advanced industrial economies (Harvey 1989; Warf 2006, 2011).  \n\nCoase and his followers suggest that firms tend to grow in size to compensate for the search costs involved in finding and retaining market partners.  \n\nThose concerned about the scope of large multinational firms have argued that the development of cheap and efficient systems of transportation and communication made outsourcing and offshoring possible. Specifically, Grossman and his colleagues argue that these types of search costs have been radically discounted, particularly in distant but large developing economies. One effect of the global diffusion of electronic information and processing has been the incorporation of distant sites of production into the production systems located in the core markets of Western economies. Here, again, it is argued that pipelines of information have radically discounted the virtues of buzz.  \n\nThe subject of this chapter has been the information architecture of financial institutions and markets. We noted that these types of institutions are rather different from the firms commonly associated with commodity-producing industries. Whereas industrial, manufacturing, and retail firms typically claim market advantage by virtue of their tangible assets, financial institutions have few obvious tangible assets, so they rely on intangible ones such as human capital and their systems of decision-making (governance), as well as their (tangible) systems of information processing. This point is developed in subsequent chapters with regard to the governance of human capital and decision-making. In this chapter, we have focused on information processing, noting that, at one level, financial markets are simply massive information-processing machines. There is an extraordinary premium on managing information both internal and external to the institution.  \n\nIt is commonly held that buzz dominates financial markets. For example, in stories told about the importance of coffee houses in seventeenth-century London, through to the importance of family and the old school tie in the years leading up to the big bang in 1986 (Dale 2004), buzz was and remains important. This is especially true for those whose careers rely on networks that bind together financial institutions with the institutions that manage and invest those assets. Nonetheless, we contend that pipelines have come to dominate buzz in part because of the sheer volume of information to be channelled and moved around institutions within and between networks of market providers. Indeed, some of the world's largest financial service providers are simultaneously sites of asset holding and switching, sites for market information and data, and sites of asset placement with portfolio managers.  \n\nThroughout, our argument is framed with reference to the authority of senior managers who set institution-wide investment and management policies. For them, information is a vital ingredient in the governance of financial institutions, for it provides portfolio managers, whether internal or external to the institution, with oversight and control. Whereas this may be conceived of in terms of coordinating complementary elements of an overall investment strategy, equally important is the control of information as a means of exerting authority over the elements that make up the realization of planned target rates of return. This is as important inside the institution as it is outside it;  \n\nportfolio managers are highly specialized and, in their own domain, often uniquely placed with respect to the skills and competence of those who oversee their activities. The flow of information over time and space inside and outside the institution can give rise to management strategies that mix and match pipelines of information with buzz.  \n\nIt should be noted that the doctrines underwriting MPT and the information architecture sustaining flows of financial assets within and between global financial centres have faced very challenging circumstances over the past few decades. In the aftermath of the Asian crisis of 1997, the long-term capital management (LTCM) debacle, the technology, media, telecommunications (TMT) bubble, the subprime bubble, and now the euro crisis, financial markets have become hostile environments. Conventional models of market processes and behaviour are unreliable, even as the premium on ambitious target rates of return has significantly increased over the past decade. In this context, investment on the margins of markets has become an essential element in the investment strategies of many institutions. However, these types of environments are just as challenging as the core markets of the global financial system, albeit for different reasons. These types of markets are, quite obviously, relatively inefficient and characterized by significant information asymmetries.  \n\nIn this world, buzz has reappeared as an issue of significance. However, many financial institutions are ill equipped to operate in this type of environment, especially when entry to emerging markets and adoption of the protocols that typically govern relationships with hedge funds disturb internal systems of management and the complementarities between portfolio managers. As a result, institutions have developed a variety of strategies to deal with these management conundrums. One such strategy has been to rely on global investment managers’ pipelines of information, which give financial institutions an opportunity to piggyback on a third-party information infrastructure right through to the emerging markets. Another strategy has been to combine information pipelines with the collection of market-specific information and data involving (in some cases) the establishment of off-site and offshore (but internal) portfolio managers. At the limit, financial institutions have abandoned their own strategies and rely almost entirely on external portfolio managers who claim proprietary advantage in terms of their information processing over the bulge-bracket investment houses.  \n\nHere, we suggest that outsourcing and offshoring result in very different contractual systems and governance regimes compared with industrial, manufacturing, and retail networks (Grossman and Helpman 2005). Commodity supply chains and detailed rulebooks establishing how tasks and functions are produced relative to the home firm are seemingly complementary. In the global financial services industry, though, rulebooks tend to disallow certain activities, limit risk exposures, and seek to impose authority over performance and reporting. These rulebooks do not seek to determine how third parties produce rates of return; rulebooks are designed to allow considerable discretion for those charged with realizing agreed targets. As such, they are used to control the activities of external portfolio managers, which may harm the positions of institutional clients.  \n\n# NOTES  \n\n1. The finance industry relies on analytical frames of reference for organizing market information. Whether imposed by theoretical principles, accepted models of measuring and pricing risk, or by evident patterns in the pricing of traded securities, the formal representation of market information is believed to guard against impulsive market behaviour, including herding, opportunism, and being caught up in speculative bubbles. Compare Ho and Lee (2004) with Hilton (2003).  \n\n2. Baker et al. (2001: 212) define relational contracts as ^self-enforcing agreements in repeated games'. They also suggest that relational contracts are “informal agreements and unwritten codes of conduct that powerfully affect the behaviours of individuals within firms. There are often informal quid pro quos between coworkers, as well as unwritten understandings between bosses and subordinates about task assignment, promotion, and termination decisions (Baker et al. 2002: 39). This approach resonates with Bathelt and Glickler's (201l: 6-7) relational economic geography, even if their approach is more programmatic and methodological than it is specific to a particular type of institution.  \n\n3. It is widely assumed that complete contracts are framed according to legal norms. By comparison, relational contracts are assumed framed against social norms and conventions including reciprocity, cooperation, and trust (Bowles 2004: 264-5). Whether either of these types of agreements comes to court is hardly ever considered. Notice, London provides third-party arbitration mechanisms for the resolution of disagreements over discrete contracts. Financial services and legal services are complementary industries (Beaverstock et al. 1999). These points are developed in Chapters 6 and 7.  \n\n4. Storper and Venables (2004: 354-5) emphasize face-to-face contact. They believe it is ‘essential to the transmission of complex, tacit knowledge'. See also Gertler (2003). Faulconbridge (2006) points out that the communication of tacit knowledge can be an organized social practice and have a spatial reach that goes far beyond the local to the global.  \n\n5. W6jcik (2011: 145) observes that proximity between traders is very important when the issue is latency--the speed with which an order can reach the matching engine of the exchange, be executed, and the confirmation of its execution return to the computer from which it was sent'. It may pay high-frequency traders and certain types of hedge funds (algorithmic traders) to locate close to one another, linked by dedicated infrastructure systems. In these situations, trading at a distance through electronic pipelines may incur higher risks and a discount on returns.  \n\n6. The ways in which information is parcelled and distributed by third-party providers can frame expectations and hence market behaviour. A similar point is made by MacKenzie (2006) when discussing the significance of the Black-Scholes model of risk pricing.  \n\n7. The data for this chart were compiled using Datastream. The expected returns line was calculated using the 126 funds in the Public Fund Survey and averaging their reported éexpected returns'. This came to roughly 7.9 per cent, which was then applied to the $\\$100$ and compounded over time. The realized line was generated by applying the realized returns from equity markets (the average of S&P 500; FTSE 100; DAX; NYA; and W50o0) and fixed income markets (the average of US Bank Prime Loan—Middle Rate; US Corp Bonds; Moody's Seasoned AAA; BOFA ML US DOM MSTR—TOT RETURN IND; LIBOR; US Treasury Const Mat 1 YearMiddle Rate; US CORP BONDS MOODYS SEASONED BAA (W)—MIDDLE RATE; and UBS AU COMPOSITE BOND $1+$ YEARS-TOT RETURN IND) and then applying those returns to the $\\$100$ portfolio, with a 60-40 breakdown, and compounding over time.  \n\n8. In effect, this characterization matches that introduced by Clark and O'Connor (1997) where pipeline extensions match transparent financial products, pipelines and buzz match translucent products, and buzz matches opaque products.  \n\n### 4  \n\n### Production of Investment Returns  \n\nResearch in finance and investment management often takes as given the topography of finance—financial centres as sites for the production of financial services and financial markets as the means by which financial assets are placed and investment returns produced (Ho and Lee 2004). As noted in Chapter 3, through much of the twentieth century, financial centres and financial markets were co-located. The production and distribution of financial services were located with financial markets, thus reinforcing the shadows cast by London, New York, and Tokyo over their hinterlands. O'Brien (1992) and O'Hara (1995) contended that being able to trade at a distance from financial markets via electronic networks would spell the end of geography. Yet, large and small investment houses continue to cluster in financial centres even if their investment strategies are realized through global financial markets (Storper and Venables 2004). Even financial products can reflect their sites of production (see Hong et al. (2005) on the neighbourhood effect apparent in mutual fund products).  \n\nIn Clark and Thrift's (2005) study of currency trading in a major financial institution, it was shown that the management of currency trading is an essential ingredient in producing returns, given the risks associated with trading currencies around the globe and between financial markets on a $24/7$ basis.More broadly, financial institutions domiciled in the West have sought to extend their investment strategies to emerging financial markets to reap the benefits of long-term growth in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In part, this reflects the search for a premium on assets under management (AUM). It also reflects a response to the adverse consequences of relative economic stagnation in the West (El-Erian 2008). For these reasons, being located in or near a ^core' financial centre is now insuffcient to make good on institutions’ return aspirations. Here, this issue is framed by reference to the power and authority of senior managers to adapt to these new realities. To illustrate, it is assumed there are two types of financial institutions (asset owners), large and small, with either growing or declining AUM.  \n\nWe begin with Coase's (1937) theory of the firm, along with those who have been following his lead. These include Easterbrook and Fischel (1991)  \n\nand Hart and Holmstrom (201o), as well as the related literature in economic geography by Maskell (2001), Taylor and Asheim (2001), and Scott (2008). Williamson (1975), who focuses on the coordination of the production of goods and services through “hierarchies and markets', has inspired a significant body of research. Here, we focus our analytical lens on the significance of human capital or talent within financial institutions for the production of investment returns. There is a growing body of research on the importance of human capital for the production of value, which leads some analysts to suggest that we have entered a new era of 'cognitive capitalism’ (Scott 2008). Human capital is assumed to have two key components—skill and expertise, both of which are domain-specific and largely non-substitutable.1  \n\nThere have been few studies published on the production of investment returns (but see Demsetz 1968). There are, however, many theories that are supposed to guide investment professionals in the production of returns, including modern portfolio theory (MPT) and risk diversification (Ho and Lee 2004; Litterman et al. 2004). These rulebooks are, more often than not, highly quantitative. They reflect the transformation of the investment management industry from one dominated by intuition and privileged access to information (buzz), to one dominated by mathematical and statistical risk and return pricing systems, executed by professionals employed by financial institutions (Amin and Thrift 1992). The widespread adoption of the Black-Scholes theorem by market participants on a global basis in the lead-up to the global financial crisis (GFC) is indicative of the institutionalization of investment management (MacKenzie 2006). Producing returns depends on managing systems, motivating employees, and facilitating coordination within and between institutions in relation to market risk and uncertainty.  \n\nInvestment institutions face many challenges when managing talented professionals who command a scarcity premium in financial centres. Although neglected through the ^golden era’ of Western financial markets, the GFC revealed the importance of effective investment management. Senior managers are the key to timely institutional coordination and the exercise of judgement in response to unanticipated shifts in market performance. This is what senior managers do, or could do, if they have the power and authority to do so. We show that financial institutions often contest senior managers' power and authority. Relying on talented individuals to produce investment returns tends to discount the capacity of senior managers to put the institution's interest ahead of other claims. This is manifest in different ways in large and small institutions, in growing and declining circumstances, and when investing in spatially extensive financial markets.  \n\n# COASE,CONTRACT,AND LOCATION  \n\nCoase's (1937) theory of the firm can read as a precursor to Demsetz's (1968) theory of transaction costs, Williamson's (1975) hierarchies and markets, Krugman's (1991) increasing returns to scale and the virtues of agglomeration economies, and Bathelt and Gluickler's (2011) relational theory of organizations, market economies, and geography. At a stretch, Coase can be allied to recent developments in the economic theory of the firm that focus on issues of fairness and motivation (see Hart and Moore 2008). Coase emphasized the authority and powers of entrepreneurs, but also noted that there are limits to the exercise of such powers, given community norms and conventions; he cited common law expectations about the obligations of 'masters' and 'servants'.? He was also concerned to demonstrate that the assumptions underpinning his analytical framework were ^tractable' and ‘realistic'.  \n\nAt the heart of his theory of the firm was the entrepreneur-coordinator—a person who, by virtue of owning the firm and exerting the authority set out in the relevant firm-wide employment contract, ‘directs production’ and the ‘coordination of the various factors of production’ (Coase 1937: 388). In Coase's account, power comes with the ownership of property. The authority to command others is legitimated by contract. Key to his model of the firm, Coase assumed that one type of employment contract would be sufficient to cover a firm's employees. He also assumed that employment contracts would be written in such a way as to provide the entrepreneur-coordinator with wide discretion over the management of the tasks and functions that make up the production process. Any limits to this discretion were shared between local firms, rather than being idiosyncratic. Coase suggested that the incompleteness of labour contracts has the virtue of enabling the variation of employees? tasks and functions without incurring the costs of renegotiation.  \n\nCoase provided an explanation of how and why firms grow in size, of when market arrangements become viable, and of the costs of complexity. He also provided a rationale for the spatial configuration of the firm, suggesting that the costs of organizing production increase as the spatial extent of those activities expands beyond the site of production. In part, he suggested that the broader the spatial field of the firm, the more diverse or dissimilar are its activities, and hence the higher the costs of coordination and the prospect of making mistakes. He suggested that firms would grow in size at a particular place to the extent that technology allows for the concentration of the factors of production and innovation, which, in combination, allows firms to serve spatially extensive markets.  \n\nFive assumptions underpinned his analysis. First, labour is a homogeneous factor of production. Second, labour is plentiful, both within the company and in the local market. Third, labour can be switched at will between the tasks and functions that make up the production process. Presumably, then, productivity is the product of an entrepreneur's power and authority. Fourth, the production of manufactured commodities depends on the combination of labour (undifferentiated), capital (machinery), and raw materials (resources)—-motivation is not an issue. Finally, each firm is an island unto itself. He deemed the production of commodities not contingent on cooperation with other firms (local or distant); for Coase, markets simply provided options for self-organization. He assumed that if the entrepreneur contracted external providers, those relationships were Pareto optimal (see Bolton and Dewatripont 2005).  \n\nIn what follows, each assumption is contested with reference to the financial services industry. In the first instance, the entrepreneur-coordinator is replaced with senior managers who do not have the powers of a company owner. Her control over the production process is dependent on her location in the corporate hierarchy. It is assumed that the tasks and functions of certain classes of labour are distinct and separable. This means that, in certain cases, both sides of the employment relationship seek function-related labour contracts. Senior managers use the segmentation of the workforce to enhance their authority, while employees seek a premium on their roles and responsibilities that is more or less consistent with their notional ^price' in the external market. It is also assumed that, over the short run, there is limited supply of certain skills and expertise in the market. Managers can be held hostage by those upon whom they rely to produce the frm's returns. As a result, switching labour between tasks and functions can be problematic.  \n\nRosen (1986) was one of the first theorists to recognize the limited supply of highly skilled professionals. He was particularly interested in how talented individuals used tournaments to represent the process that enabled certain individuals to play the market to reap enormous profits and thus claim a premium on their skills and expertise. More generally, Lucas (2009) emphasized the importance of human capital in modern economies and of how those who have a claim on ideas can earn a premium in the economy. Overlapping the Chicago tradition, Florida's (2002a, 2002b) work on the nature of talent, and the process whereby certain localities become havens for highly talented individuals, are key contributions to understanding the economic structure of urban labour markets. Similarly, A. J. Scott's (2008) argument that the increasing importance of cognitive reasoning in modern economies is embedded in the hegemony of metropolitan economies has deepened our understanding of the topology of talent.  \n\nNonetheless, there are a number of puzzles in Coase's model of the firm. Why assume that an entrepreneur-coordinator starting out as a small firm would internalize the production process? Coase's answer, it seems, depended on the benefits obtained when using a single contract to govern the various tasks and functions needed to produce the final product. Implied as well is a presumption that an entrepreneur's power and authority within the firm are unconstrained; if entrepreneurs were to rely on external contractors, the norms and conventions of bilateral contracting would constrain their power and authority. By contrast, contemporary evidence suggests that small and medium enterprises in commodity-producing industries tend to outsource many of their tasks and functions to local suppliers and that they only internalize activities when the latter grow to a size suffcient to take advantage of the economies of scale associated with producing within a company rather than between companies.  \n\nWhat exactly do the factors of production work upon to produce commodities for sale? Coase's answer was raw materials or resources. How was that possible? His answer was that rail transport had made the spatial concentration of production viable. Notice, thirty years or so later, urban economists sought to explain how and why US cities and regions had become highly specialized in terms of their industry profiles by virtue of access to resources, the costs and benefits of specific transport technologies, and the spillover benefits of co-location within industries (see Thompson (1965) on US urban growth and decline). Over time, the real costs of raw materials and resources have declined relative to labour costs, which is partly because of the increasing efficiency of capital equipment in processing raw materials. With advances in communication and transport, many companies and industries have taken on a global form, leaving behind their original geographical footprints (Beugelsdijk et al. 2010; Dicken 2011; Grossman and Helpman 2005).  \n\nTwo implications follow from this brief assessment of Coase's theory of the firm. First, to the extent that skills and expertise are important in realizing the value of the many tasks and functions that make up a firm's production process, managers may lack the power to impose order on the production process and can face situations in which the market for talent compromises their authority. Embedding this prospect in the theory of the firm would seem to be an essential ingredient in making a 'modern' theory of the firm. Second, untheorized and left aside is the issue of what managers do when the factors of production do not work on raw materials to produce products. These issues are important in understanding the performance of financial institutions.  \n\n# FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: BUILDING BLOCKS  \n\nHere are three building blocks that underpin our exposition of how financial institutions produce investment returns in the context of spatially extensive financial markets. Throughout the book, we seek to situate our analysis by reference to industry circumstances—factors that influence strategy and decision-making. Reference is also made to Coase as a way of clarifying what is particular about the industry. Inevitably, our logic is schematic in that diversity is eschewed in favour of an initial, simple, model.  \n\n### Ecology of Finance  \n\nThere are many types of organizations in financial markets representing the functional scope of intermediation characteristics of the financial services industry. Attempts have been made to map intermediation, from the smallest and simplest service providers through to the largest financial institutions that, through their production of investment returns, can determine the scope of intermediation in local and global markets. Assume that asset owners either produce investment returns internally, or outsource this function to asset managers, or some combination of both. We should remind the reader, though, to suggest that pension funds and the like are asset ^owners’ is an assumption of convenience. As indicated in Chapter 1, in that they are subject to fiduciary principles and practices, pension funds normally represent the interests of beneficiaries. In this respect, these institutions are asset ^owners' because the ultimate owners—beneficiaries—are either silent or uninvolved.  \n\nThe raw material used to produce investment returns consists of the stock of financial assets held by the asset owner, or in the case of the AUM by portfolio managers (whether internal or external to the organization). The stock of financial assets is hardly ever fixed: it can be augmented (or diluted as the case may be) by contributions (benefits), inflation (deflation), investment returns (losses), leverage (losses), and acquisitions (disestablishment). Typically, the institution (and/or its sponsor) collects the contributions from and distributes the benefits to the participants or beneficiaries. Stocks and flows are almost always transferred electronically. Beneficiaries may be geographically concentrated, as is the case of public pension plans, spatially distributed to match the geographical scope of a corporate sponsor, or found nationwide as is the case of many insurance companies. Importantly, there are significant economies of scale in the management of financial assets. Small pension funds face considerable challenges in being cost efficient.3  \n\nIf marked 'to market', the value of the assets that owners and managers hold will vary from minute to minute as the financial markets rise and fall. In this regard, financial markets are both the medium and the means through which financial institutions produce investment returns. Financial markets can be public or private. The precise form of a financial market is less important for the moment than the functions it performs in bringing investors together with investment opportunities (Dixon 2012). There are significant opportunity costs in leaving assets unplaced; it is important that the stocks and flows of assets are managed in a timely and effective manner.  \n\n### Managers and Workers  \n\nFormally, boards decide on strategic issues such as asset allocation and investment strategy. They delegate to senior managers the responsibility of realizing the institution's goals and objectives, including the target rate of return. In turn, senior managers realize the institution's goals and objectives through the relevant departments and sections that make up the institution, with the proviso that these tasks and functions could be produced internally or externally, or some combination of both. Notice, however, that boards may intrude upon the delegated responsibilities of senior managers, and senior managers may dispute board decisions, particularly those that compromise their ability to produce investment returns.  \n\nProducing the target rate of return relies on the human capital and decisionmaking procedures of the institution and its employees. The tasks and functions of the institution can be rank ordered, beginning with those that require generic skills and expertise, through to those that require domain-specific skills and expertise. Even tasks and functions that require generic skills and little expertise are likely to benefit from employees who have sector-related experience. This kind of experience can be found in other banking and nonbanking organizations. At the other end of the spectrum, domain-specific skills and expertise are likely to be in short supply. These are the product of tertiary education; knowledge and understanding of the theory and practice of asset management; and judgement consistent with the segment or segments of financial markets relevant to their responsibilities (see Demsetz (1968) on the importance of judgement in financial markets).  \n\nAt one end of the spectrum, some employees (Type I) rely on generic skills and expertise to perform their tasks and functions. They are offered a standard contract consistent with industry norms and conventions. At the other end of the spectrum, some employees (Type II) have domain-specific skills and expertise and are offered individualized contracts subject to market competition for other similarly placed employees. At the limit, there may be as many contracts as there are types of employees, creating constraints on the ability of senior managers to switch labour between tasks and functions. Nonetheless, those employees closer to Type II than Type I could demand a Type II-class contract for reasons of equitability and fairness, producing a cascade of contractual terms and conditions down through the institution.  \n\n### Coordination  \n\nIn the absence of an entrepreneur-coordinator, senior managers′ claims to manage are contested in two ways. We would like to suggest that, for all the effort devoted to creating a template or formal recipe justifying the division of power and authority, competition for power can fracture the relationship between boards and managers. Just as important, managers can face significant difficulties handling employees who command a premium in the market. One response may be to introduce an overarching purpose to the organization that trumps internal contests for power and privilege. A related response might be to introduce a ^model contract to the organization, which includes common terms of reference for judging performance and remuneration. The weighting of these ‘terms’ could vary according to the significance of different types of tasks and functions required to realize the institution's overarching purpose.  \n\nMany theorists of the firm doubt whether ^collective goals' are ever meaningful, noting the apparent ^gap? between formal authority, and authority in practice (see Aghion and Tirole 1997). Indeed, leading theorists of the firm have contended that organizations are, more often than not, characterized by unresolved conflict (Cyert and March 1963). This assumption is threaded through the literature, being found in many guises (see Easterbrook and Fischel 1991). One response is to use a form of contract that matches specific tasks and functions with a view to segmenting the production process in ways that enhance the power and authority of senior managers. If tasks and functions can be provided externally as well as internally, a divide-andconquer (DAC) strategy can be sustained—with an implied threat that failure to cooperate will result in outsourcing the relevant function (see Marglin 1974). Segmentation and task-related contracts can facilitate DAC strategies, thereby enhancing control over the production process, albeit subject to bargaining. Notice that realization of the benefits of DAC depends on the authority of senior managers and the flexibility of the contract. If implementing DAC strategies requires the approval of the board, and if bargained agreements are inflexible, senior managers may find themselves impotent.  \n\nA second option would be to enrol portfolio managers into a fund-wide management system with a view to sharing responsibility for the production of investment objectives across the institution. In doing so, a horizontal process of incorporation (HPI) for realizing stated goals and objectives, including the institution's broader purpose, would augment the hierarchy of tasks and functions. Here, senior managers and portfolio managers have two distinct but complementary responsibilities. Senior managers are responsible to the higher tiers of the organization, which is often the institution's board. In the second instance, they are also responsible for enhancing cooperation across the institution. Portfolio managers have to realize their asset-specific goals and objectives and must be willing to compromise on their immediate interests (the status and significance of their investment teams) in relation to the objectives of the institution. Realizing a stable and reciprocal relationship between different elements of the institution is, arguably, the raison d'etre of senior managers (Pitelis and Teece 2009). DAC strategies are simpler, but limited compared with what a successful HPI strategy could achieve.  \n\nFigure 4.1 provides a 2x2 matrix that links senior managers? strategy with the nature of labour contracts offered to an institution's employees. There are two extreme cases-instance D, where a DAC strategy is reinforced by labour  \n\n![](images/0c93b6425bd4875c4271b64087a936aadb280914ea414343ce7f5eb0ad0b17ba.jpg)  \nFigure 4.1. Management strategies by the nature of labour contracts   \nNote: Where ^common’ refers to a company-wide labour contract; ^differentiated’ refers to contracts by task and function; DAC is a divide-and-conquer′ strategy of management; and HPI is a strategy of horizontal incorporation  \n\nSource: Authors  \n\ncontracts differentiated by skill and expertise, and instance A, where HPI is reinforced with a common labour contract across the institution augmented, perhaps, with different weightings on the shared components of compensation according to the scarcity value of specific skills and expertise. This could, of course, degenerate into instance B, where the benefits of HPI are discounted by labour contracts that give preference to certain types of employees. It is less obvious that a DAC strategy would be accompanied by a common labour contract (instance C), except in circumstances where it is imposed by the home jurisdiction's norms and conventions. In these cases, financial institutions could spatially segment their workforces so that certain types of employees are kept at home, while other types are moved offshore to jurisdictions that enhance senior managers? overall authority.  \n\n# PRODUCING INVESTMENT RETURNS  \n\nLike Gertler (2001) and Glasmeier (2000), our concern here is with the production process of financial returns in context; it is not our intention to produce theorems applicable to all organizations, industries, and places. To set the scene, we assume that there are two types of financial institutions-large and small—located at, or close to, a financial centre. It is also assumed that both types of institutions seek a long-term investment return of at least 2 per cent (net) on invested assets over and above the rate of inflation. For argument's sake, this is a rather modest rate of return target chosen to allow us to focus on key issues related to the management of financial institutions.  \n\n### Stocks and Flows  \n\nThe stock of AUM is comprised of five separate flows—the inflow of contributions; the outflow of paid benefits; the costs associated with investment management; the returns due to investment management; and interest paid on assets otherwise not committed. Since our institution has a real rate of return target, AUM can grow in nominal terms but decline in real terms (especially if subject to increasing costs associated with compliance and regulation). Contributions and paid benefits are predictable, if considered over a three- to fiveyear period. One should notice, however, that if benefit entitlements include automatic inflation adjustment, the benefits could be less predictable than the contributions. The costs associated with investment management are somewhat predictable and subject to contract. Investment returns are unpredictable, being subject to the performance of financial markets and the mix of asset classes that make up an institution's strategic asset allocation.4  \n\nLet us assume that our representative financial institution employs an external custodian to manage the flow of assets—the collection and disbursement of financial assets to the tasks and functions of the institution, including the production of investment returns. An institution with a small volume of AUM is likely to be a price taker in the market and to incur higher costs per unit of AUM than an institution with a large volume of AUM.5 Large institutions are able to bargain for lower charges. Likewise, the bundling of services can allow large institutions to claim significant discounts from service providers on the overall costs of investment management. Notice that contracts for financial services tend to be open-ended. While there are start and end dates to contracts with a specific tranche of assets, contracts are often repeatedly turned over, with adjustments made when there are minor changes in the stock of assets the provider manages.  \n\n### Small and Large Institutions  \n\nIn Coase's (1937) world, small enterprises provide the services required to produce the company's product. By contrast, most small financial institutions contract out virtually all the services needed to produce investment returns. The set-up costs associated with internally providing the tasks and functions necessary to produce returns are significant and sunk, for the services are so specialized that their provision cannot be spread across the institution's activities. Specialist external service providers are able to discount the costs of provision by pooling clients assets, thereby maximizing the benefits of taskspecific contracts in ways that small institutions cannot achieve. Given the costs of maintaining a register of financial flows, small institutions are at a cost disadvantage compared with large institutions.  \n\nA large institution has various options, including determining which tasks and functions to produce internally, and which to purchase from the market for financial services (see Chapter 5). Evidence from the mutual fund industry suggests that insourcing has two distinct benefits. First, while outsourcing may appear to be cost-efficient, governing the relationship between the institution and its provider can incur unanticipated costs due to the rigidity of contracts and the inability of the institution to derive benefit from the market for services. Second, it would appear that the incentives driving external providers are more often internal to the provider than in the relationship between the institution and the provider (Chen et al. 2004). By implication, and consistent with Coase, insourcing can facilitate the rapid redeployment of AUM. We should notice, however, that a mix-and-switch sourcing strategy can be in senior managers' interest if they are unable to realize the benefits associated with strategies of horizontal incorporation (HPI). While mix-and-switch strategies tend to empower managers relative to both internal and external portfolio managers, this may be inconsistent with an institution's overall goal of producing investment returns.  \n\nThere are, nonetheless, two reasons why managers may combine insourcing with outsourcing on a selective basis. Managers can use outsourcing as a way of learning about new providers and/or new asset classes on the margin of the institution's strategic asset allocation; managers can also use contracts with specialist external providers as a first step towards acquiring those groups. As suggested in Chapter 7, outsourcing can facilitate the search for opportunities and learning about innovations not available within the organization.  \n\n### Flexibility and Adaptation  \n\nBeing flexible and adaptive to market risk and uncertainty is an essential ingredient in realizing longer-term investment return targets. A well-known hedge fund manager put it as follows: for the investor to thrive in [today's financial markets], he or she must think creatively and be adaptable to the changing modes of acuity. You must be able to imagine different realistic states of the world and think as both the mathematician and the artist' (Cole 2012: 14). Whereas conventional models of investment strategy focus on parcelling up and allocating the stock of financial assets to asset classes and their portfolio managers, there is a premium on flexibility that treats asset allocation as a dynamic process rather than a fixed formula (Lo 2012). In other words, it is crucial to be able to allocate and reallocate AUM between asset classes and portfolio managers in anticipation of, and in response to, market movements.  \n\nThere are dangers in flexibility and adaptation: institutions may be overresponsive to perceived and actual shifts in financial markets. As recognized in the behavioural literature, being over-responsive is correlated with overconfidence (Aikman et al. 2014). Nonetheless, this model of financial markets implies that management capabilities and resources should be proportional to the volume of AUM, to the costs and benefits of time-dependent strategic asset allocation, and to the opportunities available on the margin of markets for sheltering from adverse shifts in market sentiment. If an institution is to be effective in this kind of world, managers need sufficient power and authority, both inside the organization and in relation to external providers, to reorder commitments to portfolio managers. Being a large institution with a complex array of internal and external commitments may be a disadvantage when compared with smaller organizations that, notwithstanding their limited capabilities and resources, are fleeter of foot and less entrenched in past commitments.  \n\nAs we know, some flows are more predictable than others. As such, a constant rate of change is normally integrated within the organization. The more interesting cases are when changes in inflows and outflows are unexpected (see Lamont 1992). Consider the implications of the following cases for our two institutions, large and small (represented in Figure 4.2).  \n\n· Case 1: net inflow of assets; a marginal change to the existing stock of financial assets.   \n· Case 2: net outflow of assets; a marginal change to the existing stock of financial assets.   \n·. Case 3: net inflow of assets; a significant change relative to the existing stock of financial assets.   \n. Case 4: net outflow of assets; a significant change relative to the existing stock of financial assets.  \n\nIn Cases 1 and 2, the most likely response of portfolio managers is incremental adaptation, adding to or subtracting from the stock of financial assets allocated to them.? This type of response reinforces the status quo and requires little from managers in terms of authoritative decision-making. In a large institution, with a complement of internal portfolio managers, incremental adaptation is, more often than not, an administrative procedure. However, contracts with external providers may be asymmetrical in the sense that asset managers may be willing to accept modest inflows of assets to manage, but may be unwilling to give up, even on the margin, small volumes of AUM. Compensation for external asset managers typically includes a provision weighted in favour of larger rather than smaller volumes of AUM.  \n\nTwo implications follow. First, to the extent that a large institution has a mix of internal and external portfolio managers, internal managers may disproportionately bear the consequences of marginal declines in AUM. Second, a small institution relying on external portfolio managers may have to rewrite contracts with providers to accommodate even marginal declines in AUM.  \n\nCase 3 (net inflow of assets; a significant change relative to the existing stock of financial assets) represents an important opportunity for managers in large and small institutions to revise both their investment policies and their proceduresvis- $\\grave{\\cdot}\\grave{\\mathrm{a}}$ -vis asset allocation, and to adapt to actual and perceived changes in financial markets. Consider the case of a large institution: with a complement of internal portfolio managers, incremental adaptation is unlikely to absorb a significant inflow of assets. In any event, claiming a large share of the inflow of assets would mean that portfolio managers are willing to build and expand their investment teams. Not all portfolio managers have this type of flexibility: some smaller asset classes, such as private equity, can have few additional opportunities and may require long-term commitment to build capacity. By contrast, global equity portfolios may be more able to absorb additional assets, given that ‘timing? depends on the state of play in global markets.  \n\nHere there are two possibilities. First, managers may use the opportunity to establish new asset classes within the organization, thereby broadening the organization's scope in areas perceived to benefit the production of investment returns. Second, managers may use the opportunity to build alliances with other related institutions, thereby broadening their knowledge of the market and sustaining their authority to innovate and adapt to longer-term trends.  \n\nIn this world, smaller institutions may have the capacity to internalize a select set of asset classes that could underwrite the production of investment returns. This would empower an institution's managers in two different ways. First, the capacity to internalize an asset class, or set of asset classes, would give senior managers more power and authority over existing external providers. The terms and conditions of investment management agreements (IMAs) could be adapted in favour of the senior managers of a small but growing institution, thereby reflecting the unceasing competition in the global financial services industry for AUM. Second, the opportunity to build internal asset management capacity could provide managers with opportunities for career advancement. Success in such a venture could enable a senior manager to move on to much larger organizations. Careers are made by these opportunities.  \n\nBy contrast, Case 4 (net outflow of assets; a significant change relative to the existing stock of financial assets) carries with it the seeds of destruction. Incremental adaptation cannot accommodate a significant and long-term decline in AUM. For a large organization, with an existing complement of internal portfolio managers, this can mean reducing the scope of the organization by closing whole asset classes and outsourcing any residual commitment to those classes to external providers. In doing so, senior managers may seek to distinguish between the core activities of the institution and those that are secondary when considered over the long term. In this respect, as the scope of the institution is reduced, its capacity to adapt internally to shifts and changes in global financial markets is also likely to decline. Adaptation could be found, however, in external providers.  \n\nOne response may be to scale back the institution's investment return ambitions to match its reduced capabilities and resources. Another response may be to reduce the number of asset classes that make up the institution's investment strategy, thus sharpening distinctions between asset classes and, as far as possible, reducing cross-correlations between them. The first response makes few demands on managers' powers and authority. The second, however, places a premium on managers judgement and knowledge and, consequently, can strengthen their power and authority within the institution. As a corollary, realizing the potential of a more focused and more aggressive investment strategy can mean empowering managers to pursue an active mix-and-switch sourcing strategy that is more comparable to a DAC than an HPI strategy. Boards dominated by an ethos of risk aversion are likely to favour the first response to declining volumes of AUM rather than the second.  \n\nFor small institutions already reliant on external providers as opposed to internal asset managers, declining AUM means reallocating assets among external suppliers as contracts come due for renewal. Here, however, are three likely outcomes. First, small institutions are likely to become more reliant on external advisers, including asset consultants, thus foregoing opportunities to frame and execute fund-specific investment strategies. Second, small institutions with significant declines in AUM may be excluded from opportunities that innovative external asset managers provide. With limited available funds, and an inability to join clubs of like-minded investors willing to make a commitment of funds to new opportunities, small institutions are likely to be relegated to external managers willing and able to accommodate these types of investments. Third, it may become increasingly difficult for the boards of such funds to attract talented individuals as managers and/or advisers.  \n\nFigure 4.2 provides a 2x2 matrix summarizing the discussion about the interaction between the size of a financial institution and changes in the flow of assets to the institution. We shall consider two particular scenarios, Case 2 and Case 4, both of which deal with a change in the net inflow of assets that are marginal or significant to the institution. As noted, a marginal increase in the flow of assets to a small institution (instance A) is unlikely to make an appreciable difference to senior managers? asset allocation strategies. However, even a marginal increase in the flow of assets to a large institution (instance B) could be used to make a significant difference to the nature and  \n\n![](images/2a0ba18c434afcb6cc9f7486ba0dcdd3b5518073b7588e4a3e202fdce730f431.jpg)  \nFigure 4.2. Size of a financial institution and the inflows of assets  \n\nNote: A large institution can reap the economies of scale evident in the financial services industry whereas a small institution cannot. A significant inflow of assets allows an institution the opportunity to make appreciable changes to its asset allocation in the short to medium terms, whereas a marginal change (inflows) can have differential impacts on a large institution compared to a small institution.  \n\nSource: Authors  \n\nscope of its investment strategies. A significant increase in the flow of assets to a small institution could, however, allow it to bring certain investment functions in-house, and thus broaden the scope of its activities (instance C). Likewise, a significant increase in the flow of assets to a large institution could allow it to establish new investment programmes, even offshore investment offices (instance D). In the latter case, growth may be a mixed blessing for senior managers: the scope of their responsibilities could increase dramatically but without a commensurate increase in their power and authority.  \n\n# GLOBAL FINANCIAL CENTRES ANDMARKETS  \n\nWe assumed that our representative institutions (large and small) were co-located with a global financial centre. For example, we could refer to British financial institutions located in or close to the network of financial services that pivot on the City of London, such as Canary Wharf. This logic could be applied to US financial institutions located on the East Coast (New York City), the Midwest (Chicago), the southeast (Miami), and the West Coast. The US case is, perhaps, more geographically complex than the British one, since there is a well-developed hierarchy of financial centres focused on New York. However, even in the British case, London serves as the coordinating site for  \n\nDublin and Edinburgh, and casts a shadow over continental European financial centres, including Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Stockholm (Wojcik 2011).  \n\n### The Base Case: Co-location  \n\nCo-location means being a near neighbour or in the immediate vicinity of a financial centre that brings together financial institutions with trading functions, a broad array of financial services, and the market for investment management. As Bathelt and Gluickler (201l) and Storper and Venables (2004) have shown, co-location can bestow many advantages, including cost-effective access to untraded information and knowledge. Co-location can also discount the search costs involved in identifying, assessing, and contracting service providers. Furthermore, because service providers know that potential clients search first in their adjacent financial centre, they will locate there to take advantage of the formal and informal networks that bind together financial institutions and the remarkable range of intermediaries that make up the global financial services industry. Note that co-location facilitates the matching process, but does not necessarily constrain it, especially if the services sought are in short supply in the market.  \n\nIn theory, co-location empowers the senior managers of financial institutions. Immediate access to market information and knowledge can provide managers with the insights necessary to discount the claims of portfolio managers for preferential treatment. Even so, small institutions with static or declining AUM can be marginalized; given the economies of scale inherent in the asset management industry, service providers discriminate against small institutions in favour of large institutions that can underwrite their business models. In a similar manner, a small institution with static or declining AUM will find it difficult to hire and retain skilled professionals, given opportunities on the buy side and sell side of the financial services industry. Small institutions with growing AUM may by default become the proving ground for skilled professionals with career aspirations best realized in bulge-bracket asset management houses. Whereas a mix-and-switch strategy might appear to empower senior managers, it may be the only feasible option given a vibrant market for financial skills.  \n\n### The Base Case (Redux): Co-location on the Margin  \n\nMany public-sector financial institutions are located in cities that serve as administrative sites for local and state governments, some distance from the neighbouring financial centre. Equally importantly, the leading national financial centres of some countries play a secondary role to the relevant global financial centre (such as Amsterdam in relation to London, or Toronto in relation to New York). Large insurance companies that rely on geographically dispersed clients can locate in the shadow of a local financial centre that itself references a global financial centre (like Winterthur in relation to Zurich in relation to London). Similarly, large corporations with significant financial operations may be embedded in certain peripheral sites because of their past activities, but nonetheless interact with service providers in global financial centres.  \n\nManagers in small financial institutions with growing AUM often establish ongoing relationships with external consultants who have a significant presence in the relevant national and global financial centres. Small financial institutions with declining AUM find it difficult to maintain these relationships, so they become increasingly isolated from the service industry on which they rely. By contrast, the managers of large financial institutions may find a marginal location empowering in the sense that some financial institutions might exert too dominant an influence over others operating in the local jurisdiction. This can have two mutually reinforcing effects: (i) sustaining managers? attempts to build an institutional culture separate from, and at a distance from, the financial services industry; and (i) providing senior managers with the authority to shape the functional structure of the organization in favour of its overarching goals and objectives. As such, senior managers may shift from a DAC to an HPI strategy that relies on insourcing the production of investment returns.  \n\nThis is likely to be successful until senior managers are no longer prepared to pay the price of attracting the highest performing portfolio managers in certain asset classes. It may benefit an institution's managers to be simultaneously on the margin and close to a national and global financial centre, so that they can recruit talented portfolio managers and/or outsource functions that would otherwise undermine their power and authority in the organization. Notwithstanding the segmentation of the financial services labour market into finely distinguished tasks and functions with appropriate contracts and compensation systems, large financial institutions find it difficult to contain the ratcheting-up effects of compensation and entitlements that come with employing portfolio managers whose compensation and entitlements consist of self-referencing market terms and conditions.  \n\n### The Intermediate Case: Global Market Integration  \n\nAs suggested, there is a well-established spatial hierarchy of financial markets—-a handful of global financial markets dominate, filtering down to national and, in some cases, regional ones (Engelen and Glasmacher 2013). Throughout the twentieth century, London markets were forced to share dominance with New York and, to some extent, Chicago and Tokyo. More recently, there has been considerable competition for dominance in the East Asian time zone, pitting Singapore, Sydney, Shanghai, and Hong Kong against one another and against the Tokyo market. Nonetheless, electronic communication systems have made possible the creation of an integrated global financial market that is subject to the trading systems and behaviour of financial institutions on a $24/7$ basis and to the regulation of financial markets (O'Brien 1992; W6jcik 2011).  \n\nLarge and small investment institutions located on the margin of national and global financial centres can be represented in these markets. For a small financial institution, a mix-and-switch investment management strategy can be used to access equity portfolios, whether national or international in geographical scope, index-based, or thematic in composition, and actively or passively managed. In many cases, the specific characteristics of these equity products are less important than their risk and return characteristics, which can be compared with and contrasted against industry benchmarks using common metrics over time. There would appear to be little difference between a national and an international equity portfolio in terms of ease of access: market integration allows small institutions to access the rest of the world through existing networks of local intermediaries and service providers. If there are limits to this type of mix-and-switch strategy, these limits are to be found in the internal flexibility of the institution with respect to the decision protocols used to frame and implement its investment strategy.  \n\nLarge institutions seeking access to international equities to complement their domestic equity exposure can, in the first instance, use a mix-and-switch strategy, just like a small institution. If it is experiencing increasing volumes of AUM, a large institution can quickly build up a significant stake in an international equities portfolio managed by an external provider. Over a threeto five-year time horizon, its international equities portfolio could affect the institution's overall investment performance. However, if it is experiencing decreasing volumes of AUM, any switch to an international equities portfolio will require disinvestment in other investment classes managed by internal and external portfolio managers. This could be a slow process, made more problematic by discounts on management costs offered by external providers seeking to maintain their mandates in the context of the institution's overall reconfiguration of its investment portfolio. In this case, external providers may offer a mix-and-switch strategy that allows for the transfer of a portion of assets already under management from one asset class to another within the investment manager.  \n\nMost problematic would be the reallocation of AUM from internal portfolio managers (domestic equities) to external providers (international equities). As AUM internal to the institution declines, and as significant tranches of assets are switched from internal to external portfolio managers, the rationale for insourcing over outsourcing may itself be discounted. Costs are likely to rise; skilled portfolio managers are likely to leave; and the ethos of the institution may be subject to dispute within the firm through to the governing board. One response of senior managers under such pressure may be to permit internal portfolio managers (domestic equities) to establish a trading and investment function devoted to international equities. Inevitably, establishing this type of function may require hiring a small complement of employees to take responsibility for this function. Another response by managers under pressure may be to find virtue in the status quo.  \n\n### The Limit Case: Realizing Value in Emerging Markets  \n\nTo treat global equities products in the same way as domestic equities ones in mix-and-switch investment strategies implies assuming that the pricing of market securities is efficient at home and away. Even if market pricing is more efficient in Western markets than in emerging ones, the effectiveness of this type of investment strategy depends on being able to attribute an appropriate risk profile and concomitant return expectations to emerging markets. The pricing of traded securities in emerging markets is relatively opaque—and 'position' in such a market is a crucial ingredient in risk pricing (W6jcik 2013).  \n\nIf global equities are subject to mispricing, and if access to Asia's economic growth prospects is fundamental to realizing their investment objectives, large and small financial institutions from the West must find ways of investing in emerging markets. They could have a presence on the ground with a view to acquiring local information and knowledge that is consistent with their investment objectives. Small financial institutions, even those with growing AUM, are likely to find this a huge challenge. Many of these institutions benefit from being close or adjacent to a global or national financial centre in their home jurisdictions. Being at a distance from markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Shanghai means that senior managers of small institutions simply cannot afford the expense of a protracted search for intermediaries, vendors, or direct investment opportunities in these markets. Not surprisingly, they rely on asset consultants with a global reach based in their home markets to provide insight and advice on distant opportunities.  \n\nRecognizing the risks that come with such a strategy, recognizing the possibility that asset consultants may be unable to discriminate effectively among vendors offering long-term superior returns, and recognizing that senior managers in small institutions are likely to be risk averse (especially regarding their career objectives), small institutions are unlikely to allocate a large volume of assets to these opportunities. Should these investments fail, the overall performance of the institution would be compromised. For small institutions with declining AUM, the search costs associated with finding investment opportunities in emerging markets, combined with the caution of senior managers, are such that this type of institution is likely to fall back on the global equities portfolios that vendors from their home jurisdictions offer. Being unable to extend their geographical reach to emerging markets, these types of institutions could see their relative performance falter and decline.  \n\nLarge institutions with growing AUM, by contrast, have a great deal of flexibility when searching for vendors in distant markets. They can choose vendors, especially senior managers, who best suit the interests of the institution; and they can pursue investment strategies that seek higher risk-adjusted returns, while ameliorating the possible career risks of poor performance among the senior managers. With a large tranche of assets to be allocated to emerging markets, and with the prospect of further commitments of assets over the longer term, equitable relationships can be established with asset consultants and placement agents at a distance. Furthermore, these types of institutions are able to consider the virtues or otherwise of establishing their own investment offices in distant markets, as opposed to developing joint ventures, partnerships, and/or collaborative relationships with third-party portfolio managers based in those distant markets. Each option carries advantages and disadvantages. In all cases, their effectiveness depends on the power and authority of senior managers to negotiate, monitor, and intervene where necessary in these relationships.  \n\nIt has been noted elsewhere that establishing an offshore investment office within an institution, but at a distance from its management centre, can pose significant challenges (Dixon and Monk 2014). If established with limited resources and a narrow mandate consistent with identifying investment opportunities and appropriate vendors, this type of office could empower senior managers at home by giving them access to otherwise unavailable information and knowledge, either at the board level or among portfolio managers inside and outside the institution. If it failed in relation to the placement of AUM in emerging markets, it could be closed without any harm done to senior managers reputations. However, if it were established with considerable resources and an investment mandate for framing and implementing investment strategies in emerging markets, it could become a rival organization to existing internal and external portfolio managers. Being at a distance from senior management, it might take on local characteristics instead of maintaining a commitment to the ethos of the home institution. Under these circumstances, it could accumulate power and authority sufficient to challenge home-based senior managers.  \n\nThe options are likely to be more limited for large institutions with declining AUM. Given the difficulties of reallocating AUM among existing portfolio managers, establishing a new investment offshore office with a significant tranche of assets would require boards to underwrite the power and authority of senior managers. A more likely strategy would be to join other related institutions with a view to discounting the costs of establishing a presence in emerging markets. If successful, this type of institution could build up a significant offshore presence, even if it takes time and is unlikely to affect the overall investment performance of the institution. As such, it is better seen as an option on the future rather than a fully fledged investment programme. Note that in both cases, it is assumed that communication technologies and spatially extensive networks of intermediaries are more than adequate to the task of integrating decision-making at home with distant locations (see also Beaverstock 2004).  \n\n# IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS  \n\nThis chapter began with Coase's (1937) model of the firm as reliant on the power and authority of the entrepreneur-coordinator to direct the production process. In his account, the entrepreneur-coordinator was responsible for assembling the inputs or raw materials used in the production process, directing the labour needed to produce output, and choosing the mix of internal and external suppliers consistent with growing the business. For Coase, the overarching legal framework determined the power and authority of the entrepreneur-coordinator: property rights established their control over raw materials and machinery, while contract law provided them with the authority to direct labour in the production process. With respect to the role of bosses', the connection between Coase (1937) and Marglin (1974) is more significant than often appreciated.  \n\nThis chapter also demonstrated the distinctive attributes of financial institutions, especially vis-a-vis the power and authority of senior managers. Three key issues drive the analysis. First, in the absence of active ^owners', the power of senior managers is contingent on their relationships with the governing board of an institution, and with the skilled professionals responsible for the production of investment returns by asset class. These relationships are often formalized in contract and in models of management that seek to impose coherence on the institution. Second, the segmentation of the workforce is more a reflection of the premium on domain-specific skill and expertise found in financial markets than something that is imposed on unwilling workers. Both sides of the labour contract have an interest in distinguishing tasks and functions; this allows managers to exercise authority on specific issues while also allowing portfolio managers to seek advantage in contractual negotiations by reference to the market for scarce skills and expertise.  \n\nThird, this chapter demonstrated that the production of investment returns depends on allocating the flow of financial assets to portfolio managers, who then invest those assets in public or private financial markets. Returns flow back to the financial institution via positions taken in financial markets by portfolio managers, and are then distributed to beneficiaries. Nevertheless, there is a premium on asset-specific skills and expertise. In fact, this particular issue has two related dimensions. The financial institution's overall investment performance depends on the investment strategies that senior managers formulate and implement through portfolio managers. Crucially, the institution's location vis-a-vis financial markets can have significant consequences for realizing investment return objectives. References to co-location, location on the margin, global financial market integration, and emerging markets illustrated this point. Whereas Coase's managers were assumed to have control over the entire production process, the production of investment returns depends, in part, on the structure and performance of financial markets.  \n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that financial institutions, especially their portfolio managers and traders, are tempted to corner the market. In some markets, insider trading is endemic; in others, major institutions are able to move market sentiment to their advantage. Furthermore, some markets lack the transparency and discipline necessary to allow financial institutions located elsewhere to play an active and effective role. To illustrate these arguments, we drew a somewhat arbitrary distinction between ‘small and large' financial institutions to capture the apparent differences between institutions by size as regards their capabilities and resources in producing investment returns. We also distinguished between institutions according to whether they were growing or declining—that is, whether they were experiencing net inflows of assets or net outflows of AUM. We showed that being large with growing AUM, as opposed to being large with declining AUM, can affect the nature and scope of senior managers? options when investing locally and when investing in emerging markets.  \n\nWe noted that being located on the margin of established markets in the West need not be a significant impediment to realizing planned investment returns. Even small financial institutions with limited capabilities and resources located on the margin of global financial centres can gain access to desired financial products—albeit through intermediaries such as asset consultants. Reliance on external providers can, through a mix-and-switch strategy, provide small institutions with the flexibility to vary the geographical composition and reach of their asset allocation programme. Flexibility is enhanced if the inflow of assets does not require the institution to reallocate existing commitments towards emerging markets. However, small institutions subject to a net outflow of assets can find it difficult to move assets from conventional asset classes to emerging market products in a way that can make an appreciable difference to the production of investment returns.  \n\nAt best, small institutions have access to product providers willing to accept relatively small tranches of assets—most likely those offering little more than 'average^ returns (against relevant benchmarks). At worst, small institutions are likely to be frozen out of emerging markets because they lack the flexibility to realign their asset management strategies. By contrast, large institutions, whether growing or declining in terms of the inflow and outflow of financial assets, can place significant tranches of assets in emerging markets—either through intermediaries or directly with providers who have substantial activities in those markets. Indeed, large institutions with significant inflows of financial assets can establish their own offices in these markets, thus bypassing intermediaries and asset managers. Here, as in small institutions, the power and authority of senior managers to innovate is a key ingredient in determining whether large institutions can realize the potential opportunities that come with size. In fact, large institutions experiencing a declining volume of assets could lack the flexibility to make swift and effective changes in the geographical composition of their asset allocation strategies.  \n\nExplanations of home bias in the allocation of financial assets tend to rely on behavioural predispositions and/or arguments to the effect that local investing is more cost-effective than global investing (Huberman 2001). This chapter has provided an explanation of home bias that relies on the underlying circumstances of funds, and the realization that the power and authority of senior managers to switch asset allocation may be so contested that the institution remains in place, rather than expanding its investment horizons to encompass the globe.  \n\n# NOTES  \n\n1. Human capital, talent, and expertise are used to represent, first, the quality of labour; second, the capacity for innovation; and third, the occupation-specific realization of the value of labour (see Florida and Mellander 2014). Recent treatments emphasize the spatial concentration of human capital and the attendant consequences for urban employment and income (Glaeser et al. 2009).   \n2. According to Coase (1937: 393),‘a firm, therefore, consists of the system of relationships which comes into existence when the direction of resources is dependent on an entrepreneur'.   \n3. Industry respondents observe that financial institutions need at least five billion US dollars' worth of AUM if they are to acquire and maintain bespoke operating systems. Otherwise, they must rely on external providers and take-as-offered operating systems that are generic or (more likely) reflect the priorities of external providers. We should note that being ^small' could include local and provincial public-sector pension funds with far larger volumes of AUM, given the cost constraints that their political masters impose.   \n4. Consistent with the logic of the chapter, this account of financial stocks and flows references asset owners rather than asset managers. Vayanos and Woolley (2013) provide a model of the causes and consequences of flows between asset managers, which explains the incidence and significance of financial bubbles and busts in  \n\nfinancial markets. While there is, no doubt, a role for behavioural issues in driving senior managers' behaviour in response to changes in stocks and flows, this issue is left for another occasion.  \n\n5. Economies of scale are to be found in functions such as administration, electronic infrastructure, distribution, and compliance. There is evidence from the mutual fund industry to the effect that portfolio managers require a certain minimum volume of AUM to be effective investors, although this varies by asset class, liquidity requirements, and the scope of related investment products (Chen et al. 2004).  \n\n6. A more sophisticated response would be to accumulate the marginal increase in inflows of assets in a cash account, supplemented by planned rebalancing between asset classes, and then place these assets into 'new' positions that complement the existing ones. Here, there is a trade-off between market opportunities foregone and the prospect of reaping a return in the future from a new position and the altered asset allocation. Significant delays can incur significant opportunity costs, particularly in volatile markets.  \n\n### 5  \n\n### Scope of Financial Institutions  \n\nAs suggested in Chapter 4, financial institutions, like any other firm, must organize the production process to realize their a priori objectives. This can involve deploying their own resources to produce financial products or deciding what services to purchase from the market. The issue of insourcing versus outsourcing dominates much of the literature about the nature and scope of the firm (Hart and Holmstrom 201o). It resonates with related research in economic geography and management studies on the functional and geographical scope of firms in specific industries and political jurisdictions (see D'Agostino et al. 2013; Lowe and Wrigley 2010). In this chapter, we develop the model introduced in Chapter 4 to explain the scope of the tasks and functions of financial institutions.  \n\nThe scope of financial institutions is analysed in terms of the choices managers face given the distinctive industry and national environments in which they are located. Conceptualizing choice in this manner follows recent arguments to the effect that context frames corporate structure and behaviour (Dicken and Malmberg 2001). These arguments are based on analytical frameworks that emphasize the relational elements of economy, geography, and society (Bathelt and Gluickler 2011). To understand the nature of decisionmaking, we emphasize both the significance of assets under management (AUM) and what count as firm-specific strategic assets. As we have indicated, financial institutions have few tangible or fixed assets; they rely on human capital, governance procedures, and the information-processing systems that support human capital and decision-making. In accounting for the scope of financial institutions, we refer to the related literature in economic geography and to the significance it attributes to the relationships that sustain the effectiveness of financial institutions (see Torrance 2009).  \n\nIn the next section, “Theory of the Firm', we return to Coase's (1937) seminal paper on the firm, and the related literature on insourcing, outsourcing, and offshoring. We follow this with a discussion of recent developments that have prompted a shift in focus from ^firms as sets of transactions′ to ^firms as sets of contracts'. To set the context of the analysis, we lay emphasis on the environment a representative financial institution faces, provide a rationale for the organization's decision-making, and identify the relevant assets and resources used in the production of financial returns, as well as the significance of risk and uncertainty in realizing planned outcomes. This is followed by two related sections devoted to the insourcing versus outsourcing issue and the issue of onshoring versus offshoring. The latter is best understood in relation to the former. We note that the offshoring of financial institutions is an evolving and contested issue (internal and external to these institutions).  \n\n# THEORY OF THE FIRM  \n\nFor Coase (1937), the question was obvious: why do entrepreneurs insource tasks and functions that could be obtained in the market? Before providing an answer to the question, Coase opened with a statement on methodology emphasizing the need for a ‘tractable′ and ‘realistic’ perspective centred on the role of the éentrepreneur-coordinator'. We share his interest in a ‘tractable' and ‘realistic' perspective that focuses on the distinctive attributes of financial institutions. Coase's analysis resonates with the experience of many corporate entities, especially on the importance of senior managers as coordinators when the ^principal (owner) is either too abstract or too remote to be relevant (Stout 2012). In many jurisdictions, financial institutions act on behalf of ésilent' beneficiaries subject to legal standards of behaviour such as fiduciary duty (Woods 2011). Building on Chapter 4, we also assume that those who claim status from their skills and expertise often contest the authority and control that senior managers claim.  \n\nCoase contended that ‘the main reason why it is profitable to establish a firm would seem to be that there is a cost of using the price mechanism' (Coase 1937: 390). This claim is explained in a number of ways. First, and most obviously, there are costs associated with price discovery—determining the best market price for a set of services distinguished by their quality and quantity is challenging and, if intermediaries supply information, expensive. His argument resonates with more recent treatments of search costs and market signalling as exemplified by Spence (1977) and Grossman et al. (1977). Coase suggested that the costs of negotiating and agreeing separate contracts for services are significant, especially if there are many contracts reflecting diverse and unrelated activities. Hence, for Coase, the virtues of insourcing were twofold. In the first case, the firm need offer only one contract or a limited set of contracts across its various types of employees (tasks and functions) and, second, contracts need not be as complete as they would have to be for market providers, allowing the entrepreneur flexibility to vary performance criteria and terms over time.  \n\nFirms benefit from the system of relationships which comes into existence when the direction of resources is dependent on an entrepreneur (Coase 1937: 393). Coase explained why firms tend to be larger when the costs of insourcing are lower than the costs of outsourcing and when the rate of increase in those costs remains equal to or less than the costs of transacting in the market. This suggests that firms will be larger, as opposed to smaller, when the costs of mistakes due to increasing institutional complexity remain lower than the payoffs to be obtained from sourcing in the market. Finally, he contended that firms will be larger, rather than smaller, when the prices of internal factors of production are lower than the market prices. Importantly, he recognized that there may be decreasing returns to scale: at some point, it will pay the entrepreneur to outsource rather than insource services. By his account, there are three strategic variables with respect to managing the firm—the relative costs of services, the costs of mispricing services, and the complexity of the firm.  \n\nCoase also noted that it seems improbable that a firm would emerge without the existence of uncertainty’ (Coase 1937: 392). He disputed Knight's (1921) contention that the existence of risk and uncertainty is the crucial factor driving the establishment of firms and, especially, their size. Nonetheless, it is apparent that the entrepreneur stands to gain from insourcing if markets are subject to significant information asymmetries that introduce risk and uncertainty when pricing inputs to production. There is a balance to be struck between the search costs involved in determining market prices on the one hand, and the costs associated with mispricing internal inputs to the production process on the other. Equally, there is a premium on being able to vary production with some frequency relative to the market for services in response to unanticipated changes in market conditions for final products. Throughout, he assumed that entrepreneurs have the authority to vary inputs to the production process in ways that can realize optimal solutions to unanticipated changes in market conditions.  \n\nImportantly, he suggested that the costs of coordination, whether internally or by market, will determine the spatial scope of the firm, and that those costs will increase with the spatial dispersion of transactions. To the extent that the spatial concentration of production can limit the costs of coordination, firms will grow at centralized sites and dominate spatially adjoining consumer markets. He suggested that communication technologies, such as the telephone and telegraph, were crucial for reducing the cost of organizing the firm over time and space (Coase 1937). To make his point, he invoked von Thunen to explain why and how there may be geographical patterns in the size and location of firms. Recent commentators suggest that use of von Thunen was not, and is not, entirely plausible (Dicken and Malmberg 2001). Nonetheless, he recognized that industries and jurisdictions often have distinctive patterns of transaction and pricing practices, which would mean that vertical integration in one industry and jurisdiction might not be the favoured solution for that same industry in another jurisdiction.  \n\nGrossman and Helpman (2005) approach the problem of outsourcing in a similar manner. Like Coase, they suggested that offshoring is made possible by the geographical scope and efficiency of communication and logistic technologies and that these technologies, in recent years, have become remarkably cost-effective (see also Coe et al. 2008). Elaborating, Grossman and RossiHansberg (2008: 1981) go on to suggest that the cost of offshoring a task may reflect how difficult it is to describe using rules-based logic, how important it is that the task be delivered personally, (and) how diffcult it is to transmit or transport the output of the activity'. In effect, they assumed that there is a relationship between the simplicity of tasks and functions and the costs of coordination over time and space. The decision to go offshore is taken when tasks and functions can be conceived and executed according to welldefined and non-negotiable terms and conditions, and when communication technologies allow  for  the efficient and unambiguous transmission of instructions.  \n\nIn many respects, Coase as well as Grossman and Helpman were concerned with the complexity of the production process. Coase's conception of complexity was, however, rather vague and lacking in substance. He hinted at organizational inefficiency and limits on coordinators? responsiveness to the market because of the confusion of overlapping tasks and functions. Even so, he assumed that coordinators have the authority to impose solutions on problems of complexity. In Chapter 4, we suggested that senior managers of financial institutions do not always have this authority because their ^assets? are found (embodied) in their employees? skills and expertise. Furthermore, given the ever-present risks and uncertainties associated with financial markets, senior managers must rely on human capital and the ways in which decision-making is governed inside and outside the institution to realize planned outcomes. Complexity must be negotiated, not resolved by the exercise of authority. By Jensen's (1993) assessment, complexity may reinforce the ‘rents' claimed by powerful and entrenched interests.  \n\n# GOVERNANCE,CONTRACT,AND THE FIRM  \n\nNotwithstanding the importance of Coase for theories of the firm (see Taylor and Asheim 2001), and his importance for the transactions-based conception of the modern firm (Scott 1986), his focus on the ^entrepreneur-coordinator’ was problematic. It could be argued, of course, that managers and the management process, if suitably incentivized, can represent the entrepreneur-coordinator. However, to do so would ignore one of the most important features of modern firms, namely that they are hierarchies of authority characterized by different types of employment contracts, according to different levels of responsibility, tasks, and functions (Williamson 1975). In this respect, the governance of the firm is of fundamental importance if managers are to realize their objectives. In fact, there is a large and ever-growing literature on agency problems within firms (Pratt and Zeckhauser 1985; Schoenberger 1997).  \n\nTo accommodate this issue, the theory of the firm has moved away from the nature and structure of transactions inside and outside the firm to contracts (Hart 1995).2 For some theorists, the employment contract is simply a device for coordinating the firm. For others, it is the means of conceptualizing the modern firm (see Easterbrook and Fischel (1991) on the firm as a nexus of contracts). Yet other theorists contend that contracts are the best means of governing a firm, for they use the agreed objectives of the firm to reconcile the interests of managers and workers (Jensen 2000). As such, contract theory claims centre stage when discussing the theory of the firm. It stands for a range of issues, including the authority of managers, the responsibilities of workers, their respective rewards for committing to the objectives of the firm, and expectations surrounding their job tenure in relation to competing opportunities in the market. Given the nature of contracts, it may be very difficult to specify fully the terms of engagement, and their execution against prospective and unanticipated events (Hart and Moore 1999).  \n\nFollowing Hart and others, we assume that within the firm, employment contracts are ‘incomplete’ and ‘relational. Given the transaction costs of complete contracts, it would seem that employees are first hired according to their ^fit with prescribed tasks, functions, and appropriate standards of compensation and then, as they gain experience and their tasks and functions evolve in response to the environment, the terms and conditions of employment are informally adapted to changing circumstances. As is well appreciated, these types of firms typically rely on well-defined tasks, functions, and formal mechanisms of evaluation. However, internal labour markets often take precedence over external markets of services when seeking to respond quickly and effectively to changing circumstances. Continuity of contract facilitates on-the-job learning as well as the exploitation of frm-specific tacit knowledge (Gertler 2003). In this respect, employment contracts are not only incomplete, but also relational in that they facilitate ongoing relationships between co-workers, managers, and workers (Baker et al. 2002; Bathelt and Gluickler 2011).  \n\nBy contrast, it is often assumed that contracts with external suppliers are, as near as possible, complete and discrete. One reason why managers like to enter into contracts with external providers is to avoid making a long-term commitment to suppliers. In this respect, it is assumed that contracts with external suppliers are contingent on performance and can be terminated ^at will (with compensation). Compared with internal contracts, the market for services (tasks and functions) gives managers an opportunity to realize their goals and objectives without making a commitment to the future. Likewise, to dampen the escalation of internal commitment and impose discipline on the expectations of their own employees, managers may vary the mix of internal and external suppliers. As such, there may be an effciency gain in balancing (internal) relational and (external) discrete contracts as managers seek to enforce their authority over the production process. In this manner, outsourcing depends, in part, as Grossman and Helpman (2005) suggest, on the simplicity of contractually agreed tasks and functions.  \n\nThe distinction between discrete and relational contracts is idealized.3 Even if governed by discrete contracts, suppliers may come to rely on the firm for the flow of contracts, so thus tie themselves to it. Equally, recognizing the discrete nature of the contract, some suppliers may evade their responsibilities vis-a-vis the quantity, quality, and delivery of agreed tasks and functions (Hart and Moore 2008). In this respect, the costs of ensuring compliance with discrete contracts may rise—-especially if firms come to rely on certain market suppliers for component parts of their production systems. When suppliers are required to invest in capital stock and logistic systems to match the internal configuration of the firm, their reliance on discrete contracts may become a threat to their long-term survival. By this logic, both the firm and its suppliers may become enmeshed in knots of contracts that, in effect, carry implicit commitments akin to relational contracts (Monk 2008). Fealty to sunk costs on both sides of the relationship (firm and suppliers) may amplify reliance (Williamson 1975).  \n\nIn Figure 5.1, we summarize this discussion, providing two sourcing options (internal and external) for the firm in two contractual regimes governing the relationship between the firm and the providers of tasks and functions. Instance A and instance D (top left box and bottom right box) provide the standard ways in which the nature of the contract represents insourcing and outsourcing. However, outsourcing governed by discrete contracts may evolve in such a way that instance C comes to play a significant role in the governance of firms? supply relationships. Equally, firms may attempt to bifurcate the contractual regimes governing internal relationships to distinguish between employees with crucial skills and knowledge of the production process and those who have rather simple, replicable, and well-defined tasks and functions. To the extent that managers can maintain this type of distinction internal to the firm, instance C may well mimic the conditions obtaining in the market for related tasks and functions (instance D) rather than relational contracts. Job tenure may be limited, wages subject to market conditions, and firm-specific training non-existent.  \n\nOffshoring can be seen as synonymous with outsourcing in that once the decision is made to seek suppliers of tasks and functions outside the firm, it is a question of location nearby (instance B) or far away (instance D). In  \n\n![](images/3a6d1c38f30e1f0f6ae031155e0606400645aa7a4f8134996e035ef7a356c665.jpg)  \nFigure 5.1.

Sourcing options Source: Authors  \n\nFigure 5.2, the models of Grossman and Helpman and the field research of economic geographers loom large, especially over the degree to which firms rely on advanced communication technologies, rule-based tasks and functions, and standardized production systems and technologies to manage their supply networks. This issue is often cast in terms of suppliers located in less developed economies (instance D) transforming the pattern of trade from whole products to the component parts of products assembled in the home location (instance A). The process of offshoring relies on the coexistence of very different norms and conventions governing the workplace so that, by virtue of distance and jurisdiction, the firm can maintain its desired contractual arrangements. This suggests that managers may seek distant locations with profoundly different cultures and standards of living. These types of differences are also found within developed economies, for example in the differences between advanced metropolitan regions and semi-rural or less-developed areas (instance B).  \n\nMuch of the literature tackles the issue of offshoring by reference to the relationship between the firm's command centre and its distant sites of production. It is entirely possible that the production and delivery of firms? outputs will require insourcing at home and away, in the sense that products may be comprised of components that are assembled and distributed around the world via the officers that represent the firm. In this respect, companies in some industries may be multi-locational and require coordination between managers at the same level of the firm, as well as coordination between the firm's different tiers. This conception is developed in more detail in the following section, ^The Institution and its Industry'. Here, it is assumed that outsourcing usually carries with it a rather different contractual framework from that obtained for insourcing. It remains to be seen whether insourcing at home and insourcing away involve a shared contractual framework that is distinctively different from that of external suppliers.  \n\n# THE INSTITUTION AND ITS INDUSTRY  \n\nFocusing on the contractual norms that match stylized conceptions of insourcing, outsourcing, and offshoring provides the basic building blocks for understanding a firm's structure and governance. Nevertheless, the relevance and expression of these principles depends on the economic environment or context in which the firm and its industry functions. In this section, we provide a more detailed account of the distinctive attributes of financial institutions as they pertain to the structure and governance of a firm. In doing so, specific cases are eschewed in favour of a schematic or stylized representation of the essential features of financial institutions.  \n\nTo be specific, we make a distinction between the process of collecting and lodging AUM with our institution and the investment process itself. For example, if our representative financial institution inherits (or is provided by tender) the stock of AUM (ignoring gross flows for the moment), the size of the institution is assumed to be given, but the scope of its activities is yet to be determined. This is an important point of clarification. More often than not, firm size and the scope of activities are treated as synonymous. Importantly, our institution also relies on global financial markets to produce investment returns. Just as managers seek information from the market for financial services, the investment performance of the institution is dependent on the collection, analysis, and deployment of market-sensitive information. In other words, information is the lifeblood of the organization, affecting its form and functional performance.  \n\nFor simplicity, we assume that our representative financial institution seeks to maximize the risk-adjusted rate of return either on its own behalf or on behalf of clients who neither express their preferences nor are able to selforganize to affect the institution's investment strategies and policies. We assume that because the net return to beneficiaries is crucial in underwriting a firm's reputation as a desirable investment organization, the costs of producing the risk-adjusted rate of return are significant. On the output side of the equation, it is assumed that the notional product that the institution produces is the risk-adjusted rate of return; this income stream is produced by investing the available assets via (1) the manager's strategic asset allocation framework, and (2) asset-specific (specialized) portfolio investment teams.4 Most importantly, our institution is a planning and decision-making entity that seeks to realize its objectives in the context of market risk and uncertainty. Managers are responsible for supervising the performance and decision-making of the institution's portfolio investment teams.  \n\nHere, two important distinctions affect the structure of the institution and relationships between investment teams. We assume that strategic asset allocation is the responsibility of senior managers informed, no doubt, by the institution's target risk-adjusted rate of return and its available resources. There are, as well, specialist tools available for framing and implementing strategic asset allocation, including diagnostic ones aimed at determining institution-wide and portfolio-specific risk exposure. In this respect, portfolio investment teams are subsidiary to the institution's overarching goals and are, themselves, governed a priori by determined performance targets and risk budgets. At one level, portfolio investment teams are complementary activities in that the overarching strategic asset allocation “formula' provides a means of coordinating portfolio investment teams (Clark 2002). At another level, however, portfolio investment teams are competitors for institutional resources and, especially, AUM. The challenge is to provide incentives consistent with a priori performance objectives, while ensuring that activities remain consistent with the overarching interests of the institution.  \n\nWhereas much of the research on the firm has, as its object, firms that rely on fixed or tangible assets, our institution relies on three assets that are quite unlike plant and equipment. Performance depends on the institution's human capital and the governance of the institution—these are assets in the sense that human capital provides the intellectual resources to set strategic asset allocation and drive the performance of portfolio investment teams. It is important to note that human capital can be thought of as comprised of two elementsskill and expertise. Here, it is assumed that common sense is no substitute for domain-specific knowledge and experience (Wagner 2002). Skill refers to the ability of portfolio investment managers to anticipate and respond to the flux and flow of markets, utilizing so-called subjective as well as objective cues to inform decision-making in timely and effective ways. Expertise is, of course, related: it refers to the use of judgement in situations where decision-making protocols and routines do not provide a ready recipe for action.5 Governance can be divided into two elements—namely that coordination across the various tasks and functions is essential for realizing the risk-adjusted rate of return; and authority is vital for deciding on the investment strategy and how it will be realized. Coordination is based on procedures of management, whereas authority involves taking decisions on the institution's goals and objectives.  \n\nTo summarize, Figure 5.3 sets out how human capital and governance intersect and overlap to frame the institution. Each pair of elements provides an action ‘space': highly talented individuals characterized by significant levels of skills and expertise are shown as instance A (portfolio managers and their teams); those who sustain the coordination of the institution while assuming significant levels of responsibility for its overall performance and structure are shown as instance B (senior managers). Notice that Figure 5.3 provides space for other related tasks and functions. For example, instance C indicates that some skill and authority are important for job performance (as in human resource management) and instance D indicates that some skill and expertise, as well as a role in institutional coordination, are important in job performance (as in information technology (IT) provision). Being a four-sided box, it is assumed that other tasks and functions are not located at the corners of the box.  \n\n![](images/91aa111b83552231df5ce273ff1657faf423eef259e047ae1f2aa87881f4f398.jpg)  \nFigure 5.3. Intangible assets Source: Authors  \n\nUnderpinning this framework is a third asset, namely the information infrastructure that informs managers responsible for governance and the portfolio investment teams responsible for performance. As indicated in Chapter 3, market providers such as Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg dominate the distribution of financial information. However, our institution also seeks market information that is not so commodified in the hope of gaining an advantage over its competitors, whether by identifying underlying trends or disjunctions or by testing competing expectations of market performance. Equally important is the processing of information internal to the institution, so that those responsible for investment strategy and for coordinating the elements that make up the institution's investment strategy know as much about risk exposure and market position as those who conceive and execute investment strategies. At one level, the information infrastructure provides enough information to manage the whole institution; at another level, the information infrastructure provides managers with the information through which to exercise authority.  \n\n# TASKS AND FUNCTIONS  \n\nHere, we analyse the configuration of our idealized financial institution in relation to its size and scope. We assume that it seeks to maximize the riskadjusted rate of return, first through its strategic asset allocation framework and second through the performance of its specialized portfolio investment teams. It does so with reference to the costs of producing its desired riskadjusted rate of return and its strategic assets. It is also assumed that our institution has its complement of managers—those responsible for setting the goals of the institution and deciding on its tasks and functions.  \n\n### Insourcing  \n\nAssuming that our institution has a modest sum of AUM, the rate of return objective of the institution's managers may fail to match the assets of the institution—because of its size, it may lack the requisite human capital, governance procedures, and infrastructure necessary to realize its ambitions in a cost-effective manner. Whereas conventional treatments of the firm assume that, in its embryonic form, managers do almost everything internal to the firm, in this case it would seem that almost everything is done outside the boundaries of the institution. At this level, there is a premium on the governance capacity of managers with respect to external providers; coordination and oversight of those providers are crucial if the institution is to realize its objectives. However, it is important to notice that they are likely to depend on the reporting systems of external providers. In effect, our institution relies on the human capital and economies of scale of external providers in the market for financial services.  \n\nAs the institution grows in terms of its AUM, managers are able to bring an increasing number of functions into it. If our institution retains an ambitious rate of return target, the functions brought into it are likely to be those that can be managed and executed in a cost-efficient manner. By this logic, insourcing depends on three factors. These are, first, being able to allocate resources to a select number of functions that can meet, or better, the costs of buying the same tasks and functions in the market for financial services. Second, insourcing also depends on being able to recruit the requisite human capital to realize the performance objectives of those functions in relation to the overarching strategic asset allocation framework. Finally, insourcing depends on a governance budget consistent with those functions, complemented by an appropriate system of information infrastructure for facilitating institutionwide oversight and control. Investment in human capital and infrastructure is consistent with ensuring the long-term sustainability of insourcing policies.  \n\nAt some level, AUM will be sufficient to insource the tasks and functions needed to realize the institution's objectives. We assume that managers choose to insource to reap the benefits of being a firm rather than a network of market providers. These benefits include the standardization of contracts, insulation from short-term volatility in the market pricing of services, and, given market risk and uncertainty, the flexibility of incomplete or relational contracts. For the financial services industry at large, these benefits are apparent and significant. Given their reliance on human capital, the managers of these institutions use the relational nature of the contract to insulate themselves from market competition for skilled and talented labour on the fund management side of the business. Equally important, relational contracts can give senior managers breathing space to develop investment strategies that are different from those of their competitors. For example, some of the largest funds have made longterm commitments to portfolio managers with expertise in direct investments, infrastructure, and alternatives—who therefore carry a market premium. In doing so, however, institutions may find it impossible to hold to a single, standardized contract.6  \n\nOne response to the heterogeneity of tasks and functions has been to overlay each type of contract with a set of incentives and benefits that link compensation to the performance of the individual, the team, and the institution. Market-facing tasks and functions may claim a premium on shortterm incentives linked to performance, whereas governance tasks and functions may claim a premium on longer-term incentives linked to realizing the institution's overarching target rate of return. Further, relatively complete (discrete) employment contracts cover market-facing tasks and functions, whereas executives may be offered open-ended contracts with incentive payments that stretch out over time—possibly one, three, or even seven years. Portfolio managers employed on short-term contracts may be subject to exacting standards of performance and the threat of termination at will. If insulated from short-term changes in the market pricing of talent, they may be strategic when playing off internal rewards against market opportunities.  \n\n### Outsourcing  \n\nNotwithstanding the benefits of insourcing, managers face a tripartite governance problem. This is to do with the diffculties of balancing the long-term benefits of insourcing against the short-term ones of outsourcing; systematically under- or overinvesting in the infrastructure needed to oversee the provision of services; and the possibility that the complex nature and scope of insourced services will result in bureaucratic inertia and/or confusion. Here, there are several options. For example, the institution could use a ‘shadow' market to price the production and exchange of services internal to it. Another option would be for senior managers to establish units dedicated to facilitating the efficient coordination of complementary activities located at the ^centre' of the institution (as represented by instance E in Figure 5.3). A third, albeit related, option would be to facilitate coordination by introducing a compensation regime that promotes cooperation and the sharing of responsibility in the realization of the institution's objectives.  \n\nOutsourcing can be seen as yet another solution to these problems. Coase and those following in his footsteps argued that the availability of information on the cost and relative performance of market providers determines the scope of outsourcing. By this account, sorting through competing service providers to find the most efficient one means repeatedly having to pay transaction costs as new market opportunities arise. In any case, this type of information is readily available in the financial services industry. Furthermore, service providers touting for business often provide the information directly. However, whereas the costs of service provision are readily at hand, for some types of services (notably those involving portfolio investment management), performance is only known on an ex post basis. Our institution's managers face the possibility that, however effective they are in selecting the most costefficient service providers, shortfalls in performance may prompt unplanned searches for providers who promise better relative performance.  \n\nHere, there are two possible management strategies. First, rather than switching between market providers because of short-term variations in costs and performance, the preferred option may be to issue long-term contracts based on absolute cost and performance. Second, managers may choose to hold more than two or three market providers for the same tasks and functions (this will impose discipline on each provider), while using information about market suppliers to inform any future search for related serviceproviders.  \n\nAt issue is the rationale for choosing which tasks and functions to outsource and which to keep in-house. Here, again, there are two possible options. Managers may find it more cost-effective to outsource those that add to the complexity of governing the institution, but retain those that are complementary and that share existing human capital and information infrastructure systems. For the same reason, outsourcing tasks and functions that require more specialized or different human resources and supervisory systems may aid governance. In other words, complementarity simplifies governance (Clark 2002). External providers also require management and supervision. Notwithstanding transaction costs, discrete contracts can be a way of imposing discipline on these providers in ways not possible within the institution.  \n\nTasks and functions may be outsourced because they lack centrality to the objectives of the institution. Here, however, is a paradox. At one level, one could argue that the institution's most important tasks and functions should remain in-house, subject to internal governance procedures. At another level, however, recognizing the risks associated with bureaucratic inertia and entrenchment, one might outsource the most important tasks and functions to give managers the option of radically restructuring and redesigning their execution in the future. Whereas insourcing can provide firms with greater flexibility by virtue of the nature of incomplete contracts, it is entirely possible that ongoing commitment to internal teams becomes an escalation in commitment—where insourcing becomes self-defeating (Levin 2002: 1088). This may be why some of the largest financial institutions tend to hold to routine tasks and functions, leaving the innovative and dificult to manage ones in the marketplace subject to discrete contracts (see Chapter 10).  \n\n# GEOGRAPHICAL REACH:OFFSHORING  \n\nRecent treatments of offshoring have tended to assume that the firm is located at the heart of Western consumer markets, with the option of sourcing inputs to the production process from the margins of the global economy (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008). By contrast, the global financial services industry can be seen as hierarchical, pivoting on just a handful of global financial centres that are linked through national and regional financial centres to the consumers of financial products (W6jcik 2011). In the global financial services industry, ‘consumers’ are decentralized, whereas ‘producers’ are highly centralized.  \n\nWe have noted that insourcing and outsourcing are management options, mediated by the institution's rate of return target, strategic assets, and AUM. We also noted that insourcing and outsourcing may have distinctive geographical footprints, just as offshoring may be inside and outside the institution. In this section, we look more closely at the imperatives behind offshoring, treating insourcing and outsourcing as expressions of this phenomenon. As in Chapter 4, we assume that there are two types of financial institutions, small and large. The former have insuffcient AUM to do much more than govern a network of external suppliers in accordance with their rate of return targets. Large institutions, by contrast, are assumed to have the option to insource and outsource. For the sake of exposition, we set out both the options and the constraints; we also provide a summary of current offshoring strategies in the financial industry and emerging hybrid strategies and trends. Given the recent global financial crisis (GFC) and the euro crisis, there is a constant search for winning strategies.  \n\nIn Figure 5.4, we provide a $2\\mathrm{x}2$ box summarizing the options facing institutions, given their size (AUM) and location. Size represents the governance capacity or potential of the institution—in effect, the bottom left-hand corner of Figure 5.3 joins the coordination and authority functions of our institution's managers. With a core location, a small financial institution at the centre of the global financial services industry is likely to reap the benefits of relatively low search and transaction costs. Being at the centre of the global financial services industry, even a small institution is able to access relatively sophisticated financial products that have global reach. Nonetheless, the minimum size of investment required by major investment houses may limit access to these types of products; the institution's capacity to hire and retain specialized portfolio managers and executives with well-developed industry networks may also limit access. Relational contracts may be essential for maintaining their human capital.  \n\n![](images/73f83f8e06cb55a26e02a9f57db844cea798d36c321af7e5f3507434687d688e.jpg)  \nFigure 5.4. Strategic scope Source: Authors  \n\nSmall institutions in peripheral market locations, by contrast, face relatively high search and transaction costs. These types of institutions must rely on third-party information providers whether through electronic mediums or through consulting and advisory companies specializing in industry-wide information (Chapter 8). While the electronic medium is often highly efficient, it is widely recognized that the type of information distributed across the landscape to provincial centres without any apparent loss of immediacy provides little in the way of market advantage. Furthermore, having a peripheral location in relation to a major financial centre is likely to incur a discount on returns (W6jcik 2011). Consulting and advisory companies are particularly effective in packaging information. Nonetheless, the effective use of this information depends a great deal on the skills and expertise of managers; otherwise, they may come to rely on consulting companies for strategic investment policy as well as the choice of portfolio managers. By default, the preferred management strategy may be to outsource, even offshore, crucial functions related to fund governance (authority and control).  \n\nLarge institutions located in core financial markets may benefit from low search and transaction costs. Furthermore, being of sufficient size to choose whether to insource or outsource, managers may be able to design and configure the institution in accordance with the relative benefits of insourcing versus outsourcing by specific tasks and functions. If this is one of their roles and responsibilities, to give effect to these types of strategies may require executives to have long-term relational contracts that lock their career and compensation prospects into the performance of the institution. At the other end of the spectrum, however, a large and vibrant market for financial services may make it very difficult for executives to retain talented staff on anything other than short-term, discrete contracts. In this environment, tournaments for staff may dominate the market for financial services, forcing managers to choose between the tasks and functions they can hold internally and those that can only be obtained externally. Exercising this choice is likely to involve consideration of the costs of coordination, as well as task and function complementarities.  \n\nBy this logic, large institutions located in core financial markets have permeable boundaries and contingent relationships internal and external to the institution. By contrast, large institutions located in peripheral sites relative to core financial markets face considerable challenges. Unlike small institutions, they have the governance capacity to be an effective presence, even at a distance, in global financial centres. Furthermore, they may benefit from a steady stream of product providers willing to incur the transaction costs involved in providing market insights and information at the institution's headquarters. Just as importantly, a peripheral location may enable the institution to hold onto its skilled portfolio managers without incurring the same level of compensation costs characteristic of similar institutions located in core financial markets. However, there is a significant trade-off between insourcing and outsourcing: it may be difficult to hold the most skilled and talented employees responsible for executing specialized tasks and functions that carry a market premium. Managers may be forced to outsource and even offshore these functions.  \n\nLarge institutions in peripheral locations may, in fact, be tempted to establish branch offices or wholly owned subsidiaries in core markets. This is an offshoring strategy internal to the institution; it is a means of economizing on search and transaction costs, for it channels market information and insights through the information infrastructure systems owned and operated by the institution. Here, there is a premium on ^governance at a distance'-the internal coordination and management of separate entities in a manner consistent with the overarching goals and objectives of the institution. At one level, this type of strategy insources but offshores tasks and functions to overcome the costs of a peripheral location. At another level, however, this strategy has its own tensions and dilemmas—for example, whether to carry over to separate entities the same governance systems and employment contracts characteristic of the home location. Equally problematic, the privileged location of these separate entities may provide them with the informal ‘authority to circumvent the institution's strategic investment policies.7 Ultimately, the scope of this type of offshore strategy may be circumscribed by ‘home’ managers concerned to maintain a coherent and integrated governance regime (and culture) across the institution.  \n\n# IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS  \n\nIn this chapter, we have sketched the principles, or building blocks, for understanding the functional and geographical scope of financial institutions. Our analysis eschews the details of specific institutions and their particular jurisdictions, suggesting that our conceptual building blocks are important in their own right and bind the experiences of similar institutions around the world. Of course, there is a trade-off between conceptual abstraction and the practical details of time and place—-here we have chosen the former over the latter in the interests of clarity. Elsewhere, we have provided detailed case studies of the structure and management of sovereign wealth funds, which is one particular kind of investment institution (see Clark et al. 2013).  \n\nBeginning with Coase (1937), we also drew on more recent research that emphasizes the problematic nature of authority within firms, and the nature and structure of contracts within and outside firms. In doing so, we exploit recent interest in the geographical reach of the modern firm and how managers deal with the costs of space and time. Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg's (2008) model of offshoring relies on communication technologies to mediate the transaction costs involved in contracting at a distance. While significant for our analytical framework, it is also apparent that the focus of many scholars of the theory of the firm is on institutions that literally make things, exchange commodities, and sell them in the global marketplace. Our theoretical framework distinguishes between firms that make things (as in commodities) and financial institutions that produce investment returns that are disembodied from the commodity production and distribution systems that girdle the world.  \n\nA crucial point of departure for the chapter was the objective function of our representative financial institution—the maximization of the risk-adjusted rate of return. We explain how this is conceived and how its various elements drive the ^production’ of the financial ‘product'. Importantly, we distinguish our idealized financial institution from conventional firms by the nature and scope of its strategic but intangible assets. Unlike conventional industrial firms, financial institutions have little in the way of fixed assets: they rely on human capital, governance procedures and policies, and systems of information infrastructure that allow for oversight of their operations and access to the global financial system (Clark and Urwin 2008a). It is debatable whether these assets are actually assets in the sense that, like plant and equipment, they could be sold to the highest bidder. In many respects, these assets are sunk costs: they represent significant investments that, to competitors, may be seen as comparative advantages in realizing investment goals.  \n\nBased on these distinctions, we explain the nature of the governance problem in large and small financial institutions. Likewise, we explain how and why those that produce financial returns have distinctive claims for compensation and advantage in their own right. On this basis, utilizing our characterization of the assets of financial institutions, we explain the logic behind insourcing and outsourcing and, ultimately, the geographical reach of financial institutions. Whereas the logic behind insourcing and outsourcing may be familiar, we suggest that extending the geographical reach of financial institutions is intimately related to their location in the global hierarchy of financial centres. Indeed, quite unlike conventional models of the firm, which treat the market for services as ubiquitous, in our formulation it matters a great deal where financial institutions are located relative to national and global financial centres.  \n\nIt is widely believed that there are decreasing returns to scale, in the sense that the increasing complexity of a firm's tasks and functions may become costly relative to the market for services and thereby prompt managers to switch to outsourcing. We also emphasize the coordination problems associated with large financial institutions, suggesting that managers may seek to mediate these costs by introducing internal or shadow markets for services produced by the institution. Managers may also establish coordination platforms and virtual sites of functional integration designed to rationalize service provision and use. These types of management strategies focus on the complementarities between tasks and functions. Outsourcing, or even offshoring. by contrast, should be understood as driven by the lack of complementarities between certain tasks and functions. This argument reflects a related point made by Clark (2002) about how and why certain financial tasks and functions are concentrated in single sites of production, characteristic of bulge-bracket global investment houses.  \n\nFinally, it should be acknowledged that our models of management assume that managers are well intentioned and have, as their overriding interest, the welfare of beneficiaries. While useful for the purposes of conceptual clarity and analysis, this assumption may not withstand scrutiny in certain cases. Indeed, industry commentators acknowledge that there are many instances of entrenched executives relying on insourcing to drive the scope of the institution and ultimately the compensation of managers. This would seem to be an everpresent threat to the effective governance of these institutions. Not surprisingly, one way of mediating this possibility is to link the objective function of the institution (maximizing returns) explicitly to the welfare of its ultimate beneficiaries and customers. Whether this is a successful strategy would seem to depend on the degree to which internal cultures of value can be distinguished from the interests of talented individuals in reaping a premium in the global market for financial services. This issue is significant for financial regulators around the world.  \n\n# NOTES  \n\n1. See also Aoyama and Ratick (2007) on the importance of trust and control when it comes to assessing whether the promised benefits of outsourcing can, in fact, be realized. 2. In a related vein, Maskell (2001: 329-44) disputed the importance attributed to transactions inside and outside the firm, arguing that any such distinction rests on an assumption that there is something special about markets compared with firms. He goes on to indicate that ‘thinking of all organisations as groups of explicit or implicit contracts among owners of factors of production represents a fundamental advance'.  \n\nIn what follows, we amplify this argument using a somewhat different typology of contracts relevant to financial institutions.   \n3. MacNeil (1980: 10-11) described discrete contracts as ^primitive’ compared with relational ones in that the latter bind together interdependent economies with high levels of specialization and exchange. Others, however, see discrete contracts as consistent with economic efficiency, for they offer the contracting parties an option to abrogate commitments if need be. As such, discrete contracts are consistent with philosophical conceptions of liberal democracy, in which individual preference and choice trumps social commitment.   \n4. It is widely observed that high levels of intimacy, personal commitment, and mutual benefit characterize some of the most successful portfolio investment teams. They motivate one another, they monitor one another's commitment, and they reinforce their shared identity against the authority of the institution's managers (Teece 20oo). It is not surprising that when other institutions poach ‘star traders', they take their team members with them.   \n5. Harvey (2012: 200) summarizes the notion of skill in terms of ^practice makes perfect'. He, like Yates and Angott (2012), distinguishes skill from judgement, suggesting that the latter is more than the deployment of a practical routine; it involves making decisions based on the use of probabilistic reasoning. We prefer to use the term ‘expertise’ in that it includes judgement along with other types of reasoning that allow agents to go beyond accepted modes of decision-making.   \n6. Differential compensation with this type of institution is often more difficult when a public body or agency sponsors it. Therefore, the advantages of insourcing may not be realized because of the lack of flexibility of senior managers with respect to standards of contract and remuneration. By this account, outsourcing may be more desirable, especially if the terms of external contract and engagement demand little in the way of reporting requirements.   \n7. In these ways, offshore offices that carry with them a team-based ethic or sensibility may see themselves as rather separate from the sponsoring institution's goals and objectives. As with many portfolio investment teams, the premium on internal coherence and common commitment may reinforce a sense of separate-and-different, which differences between jurisdictions in compensation practices, reward systems, and career prospects amplify.  \n\n### 6  \n\n### Investment Management Contracts  \n\nIn this chapter, we focus on contractual relations between financial institutions and their service providers, emphasizing the form and functions of agreements with investment management providers. We explain how and why these contracts are quite different from those that bind together firms and suppliers in commodity-producing industries. Many contracts for investment management services can be terminated at will. Nonetheless, they are used because they provide frameworks for governing relationships in the context of risk and uncertainty rather than simply as instruments for managing the supply of services. We also explain how and why the jurisdiction in which these contracts are written matters to parties on both sides of the market. This is especially significant for the United Kingdom and Europe, but also for other regions. Jurisdiction selection is explained by reference to financial institutions' need for procedural fairness. In some instances, the suppliers? interest in discounting their accountability to clients can explain the choice of jurisdiction.  \n\nThere is an extensive literature on offshore financial centres, especially those that shelter the financial services industry from tax liabilities (Wojcik 2013). Although this is an important consideration (Wainwright 2011), these offshore centres also have significant roles in the governance of contractual relationships with the financial services industry. Explicating how and why this is the case is one contribution of the chapter. Here we articulate the conceptual building blocks needed to understand the role of contracts in the investment management industry. Our analytical strategy recognizes that risk and uncertainty are pervasive aspects of financial markets and are arguably deeply embedded in the contractual relationships that bring financial institutions and their suppliers together. Likewise, we suggest that the geography of contract is important, with jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom serving as the bridging point between geographically dispersed financial institutions and centralized market providers.  \n\nIn the next section, “The Nature of Contract, we begin with the standard model of contract, noting its underlying principles and the differences between discrete and relational contracts. The real world of financial markets and the financial services industry complicate this logic because risk and uncertainty temper expectations of the diligence of service providers in realizing agreed objectives. To illustrate, we compare the nature and performance of contracts in commodity-producing industries against those in the financial services industry. Taking the argument a step further, we suggest that many financial institutions treat contract as a desirable thing in itself and as a framework for governing relationships over time and space. In these ways, contract plays a complex and not entirely consistent role in the financial services industry. This is illustrated by reference to the demand and supply of contract by jurisdiction, suggesting that the choice of jurisdiction is a significant aspect of the European and global financial services industry. Based on this research, we would suggest that the ideal of contract is a chimera where the practice of contract involves the exercise of power (Shiffrin 2007). As indicated here, the choice of jurisdiction in relation to the exercise of contract can be intimately related to the relative powers of the contracting parties.  \n\nBefore proceeding, it is important to comment briefly on the exposition of our argument and the limits of our research. As noted in Chapter 1, our discussion of contractual frameworks is necessarily abstract because private contracts are proprietary documents. These documents are subject to confidentially clauses designed to limit third-party disclosure of the form, terms, and conditions of agreed contracts. In a number of instances, we have encountered situations where disclosure of contractual terms and conditions has been strictly limited, even within organizations, between functions. It is not surprising, therefore, that most studies of contract in the social sciences, including economics, sociology, and management studies, do not disclose the sites of fieldwork, the nature and content of the documents analysed, or the parties involved.1  \n\n# THE NATURE OF CONTRACT  \n\nBolton and Dewatripont (2005) and Posner (2003) begin their expositions of bilateral contracts with two self-interested parties who have more to gain from forging a transaction and carrying it through than acting separately. Bolton and Dewatripont assume that both parties are means-and-ends rational and seek to maximize their respective interests. Explaining the significance of contract, Bolton and Dewatripont suggest that risk and uncertainty can complicate the realization of planned transactions between well-intentioned individuals. Less analytically, Posner demonstrates that the time involved between making a commitment and realizing its completion can provide parties with opportunities to engage in gamesmanship. This type of behaviour may harm one or both of those involved or, worse, undercut the willingness of others to make similar commitments.  \n\nWhereas individuals can get by on a ^cash-and-carry basis', Posner contends that society as a whole benefits from the ^good-faith performance’ of past commitments. Indeed, the modern economy, based as it is on the division of labour and the specialization of tasks and functions, trade and exchange, and networks of collaboration, is only possible if commitments to the future are honoured (even in their breach). Posner (2003: 94-5) argues that ‘the fundamental function of contract law ... is to deter people from behaving opportunistically towards their contracting parties in order to encourage the optimal timing of economic activity and (the same point) obviate costly self-protective measures'. In a related statement, Bolton and Dewatripont (2005: 3) note that their exposition presupposes the existence of 'a well-functioning legal system'. They assume that ^contracting parties do not need to worry about whether the courts are able or willing to enforce the terms of the (agreed) contract precisely'. Posner is not nearly as sanguine.  \n\nBilateral contracts have certain characteristics. The parties undertaking them are assumed to do so from unencumbered positions, which allow them to negotiate the best deal without concern for the past. It is also assumed that the costs of contracting are small relative to the benefits, not just in absolute terms (for every contract) but also relatively (comparing one contract to another). If circumstances change to make the original terms and conditions unduly onerous on one or both parties, it is assumed that there are mechanisms available to renegotiate them. This may include compensation for parties that relied on the original terms and conditions. The efficiency of bilateral contracts depends on the clarity of the terms and conditions, especially over what counts as the appropriate measures of performance of both parties to the contract. Bilateral contracts are assumed ^complete’ in that on termination there are no residual claims to be adjudicated or interests to be reconciled.  \n\nFor Bolton and Dewatripont and Posner, the virtues of contract can only be realized if there are independent bodies to adjudicate between the competing claims of self-interested parties. This is not meant to imply that every contract is subject to the force of law. Rather, the existence of a system of adjudication, mediation, and enforcement provides both parties with incentives to carry through their commitments. To the extent that the legal system is an effective and reliable adjudicator of contractual disputes, parties to contracts seeking to avoid the costs of adjudication are likely to self-regulate their behaviour in ways consistent with societal expectations. As Posner observes, a contract is more often than not a legal document that has its origins not only in the intentions of the parties concerned, but also in the legal apparatus of the state. In this respect, bilateral contracts are instruments for facilitating the efficient realization of transactions between parties.  \n\nWhereas much contract theory presupposes that the object of analysis is a bilateral contract, attention has shifted towards relational contracts, which are, by definition, incomplete in three ways. First, they may extend in time without a specified or required date of termination. Second, their terms and conditions may be subject to revision and renegotiation over time as circumstances change and as parties seek to rebalance separate and mutual benefits within the contract. Third, they may be a means of economizing on the search costs associated with finding other parties who may or may not provide complementary services. In this respect, bilateral contracts can become relational—-a means of governing economic and financial relationships rather than instruments based on a priori defined costs and benefits that open and close at certain dates and times.  \n\nDiscrete contracts provide a start and termination date, as well as an explicit accounting of the costs and benefits to be shared between the contracting parties. If underwritten by social norms and conventions, such as the moral obligations associated with making a promise, there need be no ambiguity over realizing their expected benefits, and the role of law in ensuring that those expectations are, as much as possible, met. Relational contracts are more complex and multifaceted. Without a specific termination date, there are periodic reviews of the costs and benefits of remaining with the contract, balancing progress to date in meeting desired objectives against the costs of breaking it and the search costs associated with finding other contractual partners. By contrast, relational contracts are judged successful to the extent to which they cope with and enable parties to adapt to changing circumstances.  \n\n# FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL MARKETS  \n\nWhereas much discussion about contract in law and economics eschews contextual variables, economic geographers emphasize the interaction between principles and context, suggesting that observed outcomes are best understood at the intersection between these elements of theory and practice (Bathelt and Glickler 2011). It is notable that cognitive science makes a similar move when explaining observed behaviour: the environment in which people make decisions mediates cognitive predisposition and provides for wide variation in plausible behaviour (Clark 2013). Five factors are crucial to understanding the nature and scope of contracting in financial institutions and markets.  \n\n### Agents, Principals, and Fiduciaries  \n\nThe financial institutions that are the objects of our research are beneficial in that they act on behalf of absent owners or silent principals. Attempts have been made to engage principals in the hope that it will encourage them to get involved and directly express their interests. However, most principals are neophytes when it comes to understanding and giving voice to their long-term financial interests. Corporate officers and trustees act in their stead, subject to common law and statutory requirements on the exercise of authority and responsibility. As such, they typically delegate responsibility to others, whether inside or outside the institution, to realize the investment objectives of the institution and hence the interests of beneficiaries. These agents are accorded deference for their domain-specific skills and expertise (see Chapters 4 and 5).  \n\nIn large part, fiduciaries join the interests of beneficiaries with the skills and expertise of agents. Typically, they report to beneficiaries on an annual basis on the status of their entitlements, the financial standing of the institution, and the circumstances affecting their current and expected welfare. Agents report on their performance to fiduciaries on a more regular basis (perhaps monthly, often quarterly, and certainly annually). Performance criteria are normally established by contract; more often than not, performance criteria are part of the norms and conventions of the financial services industry and include, for example, appropriate third-party measures of relative performance against industry benchmarks. In many cases, fiduciaries employ other agents to certify the integrity and quality of reported performance measures. To provide reference points against which to evaluate stated performance, fiduciaries may also employ agents to collect performance data from a wide range of industry providers.  \n\n### Geographical Structure of the Industry  \n\nFinancial institutions owe the location of their headquarters, if not their sites of operation, to whatever entity (or entities) is their sponsor'. Their corporate officers and trustes are typically located at some distance from major financial centres and the handful of global financial markets that dominate international financial stocks and flows. By contrast, most agents co-locate in national financial centres and have a significant presence in global financial markets (Storper and Venables 2004). Electronic networks sustain the routine communication between (dispersed) financial institutions and their (centralized) agents, as well as the collection and distribution of financial assets to the myriad of agents located in major financial centres.  \n\nMultinational firms dominate the financial services industry at the global level. Economies of scale and scope reinforce the complementarities between tasks and functions to enable the provision of products and services with appropriate market-facing characteristics (Clark 2002). In London and New York, small providers operating on the margins of service provision and amenable to innovation and development (such as hedge funds) co-locate with the large ones. In the major continental European centres, large banking institutions—-often the national ^champions'—tend to dominate the provision of financial services. Their size and significance is such that intermediation is limited, with many tasks and functions held internally rather than outsourced. This has implications for the site and process of contracting (Gilson et al. 2013). London and New York are hosts to a remarkable depth and range of financial service providers, offering products, services, and organizational forms not otherwise available in national financial centres.  \n\n### Products Sought and Produced  \n\nManufacturing industries produce material goods. Financial institutions deliver products and services: they contract investment managers to produce a target rate of return on assets invested. This rate may be specific to an asset class, a certain (industry or geographic) segment of an asset class, or to the style or strategy of the investment. The target rate of return may be accompanied by limits imposed on risk exposure and the holdings of certain securities within agreed asset classes. Typically, investment managers report performance against either an absolute or a relative return target measured against industry norms and benchmarks. Investment managers require a minimum volume of assets, base fees on assets under management (AUM), and shy away from performance-related compensation (aside from certain classes of alternative investments).  \n\nIn Chapter 4, we explained the financial production process in relation to the investment organization's resources and assets. These include the talent and skills of portfolio managers, the process of decision-making, and the information infrastructure that supports judgement, authority, and action. Typically, contracts between financial institutions and investment managers are open-ended in that investment managers are expected to invest according to some measure of performance until the client indicates a wish to change strategy and/or terminate the agreement. In part, this is because the target rate of return is set either against expected liabilities, or some notion of future welfare (extending ten, twenty, even fifty years into the future). The transaction costs involved in assessing performance, deciding to change managers, and hiring replacement managers (or reallocating AUM to existing managers) are significant for both small and large financial institutions.  \n\nBy convention, both parties can terminate these contracts at a month's notice. However, some investment managers, particularly in illiquid asset classes like infrastructure, require clients to commit assets over the long term, utilizing lock-in provisions and penalty clauses for early termination to deter financial institutions from switching assets between managers should performance fall short of expectations. In many cases, target rates of return allow for a specified range of returns around a benchmark. To the extent that target rates of return are set with respect to industry benchmarks, the interests of financial institutions and investment managers may diverge when, for example, managers meet their benchmarked target rates of return in a declining market. In any event, many 'manage' returns in a way that maintains good relations with their clients—even if that means adapting or dramatically shifting their investment activities and transactions to meet return targets at specific dates.  \n\n### Product and Financial Markets  \n\nInvestment managers in national and global financial markets produce returns, but there is considerable variety in the structure, performance, and management of financial markets around the world (Wojcik 2011). Furthermore, it is evident that there is a hierarchy of financial markets. This means that regional markets tend to follow national markets, and national markets either lead or follow global markets, depending on their place in the 24-hour trading clock (Clark and Thrift 2005). Some markets are more efficient in terms of price formation and disclosure than others. Drawing on our discussion, there are four issues immediately relevant to the process of contracting:  \n\n· First, developed markets oscillate between periods of relative calm, when expectations tend to be met and encourage further trading, and moments of turmoil and disruption, when expectations are often not met; this might either encourage higher levels of turnover, or move investors to sit out market turmoil in the hope of re-entering when expectations are moresettled.   \n· Second, financial markets are non-stationary in the sense that momentum carries forward market participants, their expectations, and their plans for the future. Because market participants adapt their expectations against observed and expected conditions, markets hardly ever go backwards and, more often than not, go forwards (Lo 2012). As such, risk models that approximate current market conditions are vulnerable enough to unanticipated shifts in market conditions and expectations to become self-defeating.   \n· Third, the repeated process of producing the rate of return does not necessarily lead to an ever-closer approximation of the target. The production process depends on anticipating market movements and others? reactions to more or less commonly observed information. Unanticipated shifts in market sentiment and behaviour as well as exogenous shocks are common (Shleifer 200o). Noise can radically affect the skills and expertise  \n\nof managers who were better than average in previous periods (compare Clark 2015 with Levitt et al. 2012).  \n\n. Fourth, herding is a reasonable defensive strategy if the target rate of return is benchmarked against market performance; following market sentiment is a way of approximating clients′ expectations-even if this type of behaviour reinforces systemic shocks.  \n\n### Investor Strategy and Skill  \n\nWe distinguish two kinds of investing: one is deliberate and based on skills and expertise with respect to target rates of return, while the other is essentially gambling on the path of market sentiment. Unfortunately for clients, it is difficult to differentiate the two, especially if there appears to be some randomness in the period-to-period sequence of returns reported to clients. Investment managers may reap the benefits of having a certain stock of skills and expertise, and decision protocols that map onto current market momentum. However, past success can promote an illusion of skill, ignoring the underlying properties of financial markets (Kahneman 2011). In this respect, clients may incorrectly attribute skill and expertise to investment managers, thereby reinforcing commitment by increasing their allocation of AUM. When events turn against investment managers, it may be difficult to identify the causes of shortfalls in performance.  \n\nCONTRACT: FORM, FUNCTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE  \n\nFor some theorists, historical differences between the institutions and markets of different nations are enough to distinguish between the Anglo-American, continental European, East Asian, and Latin American types (see the literature spawned by Hall and Soskice (2001) on the ‘varieties of capitalism'). For others, form is less significant than substance in that the former is deemed a 'shell given life by the specifics or issues that take it into the world of practice (Kennedy 1976). For yet others, differences in institutional form are less significant than their functionality when nation-states and major corporations respond to global financial imperatives (see Clark and Wojcik 2007; Dixon 2012). In this section, we argue that contractual form is very important and valued as a thing in itself. So too are the functions of contract and how it is governed. Both are important in understanding the performance of contractual relationships between financial institutions and agents and the choice of jurisdiction in which to locate contract.  \n\n### Form  \n\nAccording to Summers (2006: 80), a ^form-oriented mode of analysis' should focus on the units of a legal system, emphasizing their purposes, constituent features, and organizational structure. A unit can be distinguished in terms of its resources and its boundaries. He noted that units must be seen in relation to ‘the legal system as a whole'. Crucially, he suggested that legal procedures, rules, and regulations usually come after the formation of legal systems and units. Anglo-American legal systems are widely acknowledged to combine vestiges of English common law, of which contract law is a constituent element, and statutes that represent the scope and significance of the regulatory state through the twentieth century (Calabresi 1982). For centuries, English courts regulated the nature and scope of private contracts on a caseby-case basis. Through the twentieth century, contract law was formalized in statute in terms of its scope and its necessary ingredients.  \n\nContract embodies certain intrinsically valuable features. Riles  (2011) observed that when the US government rescued American International Group (AIG) in the depths of the global financial crisis (GFC), the one thing deemed sacrosanct was the rule of law, or maintaining the integrity and enforceability of contracts. The significance of contract could be attributed to its functionality. However, the point that Riles made is that whereas one can measure and gauge functionality in terms of contractual efficacy, the significance that policymakers attribute to contract as an institution means that policies that might discount the value of contractual commitments are simply not considered. She also observed that, despite the majority of financial transactions and agency agreements originating in far-off jurisdictions, the global financial services industry places a far higher value on UK (England and Wales) and US contract law than on the contract law of other jurisdictions.  \n\nBeing a constituent element or unit in Anglo-American legal systems, contract is expressed in validated documents. Financial contracts come in a variety of shapes and sizes as befitting the specific interests and circumstances of the parties to them. However, it is apparent that the financial services industry and its associated professional bodies have encouraged the adoption of standard contractual models and templates. Standardization simplifies negotiation and agreement, encourages the formation of shared expectations and commitments, and economizes on transaction costs. It also facilitates agency relationships with external providers and ultimately deepens the market for financial services. Furthermore, standardization gives legal advisers and the consultants who manage the process of evaluating agents a ready-made independent basis for assessing the proffered contractual terms and conditions. There is a market for standardization with various providers competing for dominance (Gilson et al. 2013).  \n\n### Functions  \n\nPosner (2003: 94-5) summarized the functions of contract as follows: ^(1) to prevent opportunism, (2) to interpolate efficient terms, (3) to prevent avoidable mistakes in the contracting process, (4) to allocate risk to the superior risk bearer, and (5) to reduce the costs of resolving contract disputes'. These functions have a behavioural element, a procedural benefit, and an overarching economic benefit relevant to the parties concerned, as well as to society as a whole (for example, to allocate risk to the parties best able to bear it).  \n\nIn the financial services industry, standard investment management agreements (IMAs) cover a wide variety of asset classes and are intended to prevent opportunism and reduce the costs of resolving contractual disputes. We should note, however, that investment managers rarely bear the costs directly of poor investment performance; poor performance can, however, prompt clients to terminate their IMAs. In this context, the narrative accompanying contract is used to define what the agreement covers, the terms it uses, and the procedures whereby it is implemented (start date, notice of termination, and expectations on continuity). Contract is a means of performing an agreement between parties. Contracts for financial services can be extensive in scope and quite demanding in terms of the expertise needed to understand each clause. The standard UK IMA is between sixty and seventy pages in length and requires side letters to clarify points subject to interpretation. Some principals and agents, however, are content with short, simple, and relatively open IMAs, leaving the meaning and interpretation of the agreement to the parties concerned on an ongoing basis. In this respect, contracts serve as frameworks for relationships with service providers that stretch over time and space.  \n\nIMAs normally specify the fees involved in managing allocated assets, varying by asset class and style of investment. However, these agreements are less precise when it comes to specifying the ‘service′ provided by investment managers and the criteria to be used when determining whether performance has met agreed targets. As noted, risk and uncertainty are everpresent features of global financial markets. In this regard, contracts can be seen as instruments designed to forestall overreaction to unexpected events in financial markets, thereby promoting a longer-term view of the significance of individual events in relation to market volatility. Notwithstanding the fact that most IMAs allow for termination at will, the transaction costs involved in exercising those rights are significant, especially if switching between providers becomes a customary response to short-term events. Even so, it is widely assumed that clients switch between providers more often than is justified by trends in manager and market performance (Kay 2012).  \n\n### Performance  \n\nBy convention, contract is performed’ in the financial services industry in three different ways. First, clients are sent quarterly reports on investment performance that reference the appropriate benchmarks and risk protocols. Second, repeated visits to the client by the fund manager provide an opportunity to justify investment performance and prospects. Third, the fund manager may solicit representatives of clients to attend conferences that set out new research and investment programmes. Here, fund managers seek to bypass other agents like investment consultants. The default option is continuity of the relationship. Breakpoints in the relationship appear when there is evidence of systematic negative (relative) performance over time, or where there are indications that the fund manager's narrative on the chosen investment strategy, its conception and implementation, and its place in the world relative to other fund managers lacks coherence or plausibility.  \n\nFundamentally, contracts help service providers sustain their businesses. With increasing returns to scale, continuity of client commitment is a necessary, albeit insufficient, condition for success, especially given that companyspecific compensation is often tied to the volume of AUM and that portfolio managers benefit from liquidity when seeking to manage returns against benchmarks. Large short-term inflows and outflows of assets can not only rapidly increase processing costs but also disrupt the risk and return strategies across the entire spectrum of a financial institution's asset classes. Under such circumstances, many investment managers have an interest in writing IMAs in such a way as to dampen client switching while, if necessary, giving their portfolio managers time to recover their short-term positions against the relevant benchmarks. Contract is performed in a manner consistent with the separate as well as shared interests of clients and managers.  \n\n# CHOICE OF JURISDICTION  \n\nIn this section, we bring the discussion of contractual form, function, and performance to bear on the choice of jurisdiction. We show that the choice of jurisdiction can play an important role in governing contractual relationships. We concentrate on three strategic options—in situ or default contracting; contracting in London; or contracting in offshore jurisdictions.  \n\n### In Situ or Default Contracting  \n\nEthnographies of financial institutions note that market participants take the structure of the industry for granted (Abolafia 1996; O'Barr and Conley 1992;  \n\nRiles 2011). In a similar fashion, economic theorists take the existence of well-functioning legal systems for granted (Bolton and Dewatripont 2005). One indication of the significance of the commonplace in the global financial services industry is the ready acceptance of standardized IMAs. As noted, these agreements find favour on both sides of the market and are often legitimated by agents with an interest in certifying their status. These agreements are not ^offcial in the sense of being mandated by government but originate with industry associations, professional bodies, and consulting companies. Given the importance of a small number of multinational law firms in the global financial services industry, it is not surprising that similar IMAs are to be found around the world, including the United Kingdom and Europe, North America, Australia, and Hong Kong (Beaverstock 2004).3  \n\nStandard IMAs reference the asset class or classes and the investment style of the mandate; they also summarize the objectives of the mandate and the fees charged by the manager. If a target rate of return is identified, it is set within the context of a relevant benchmark, an acceptable band around that benchmark, and the time period over which performance is to be judged. Accompanying these schedules are documents on issues such as custody, securities lending, and risks. Also included are statements about how redemptions might be made, the notice period required in exercising redemption, and caveats on redemptions, such as when exogenous shocks disrupt markets. Parties to these contracts agree not to disclose terms and conditions without the express permission of the other party. As for disputes about performance, IMAs typically set out a dispute resolution process that can include the investment manager's head of compliance and industry-based dispute resolution systems (national and international).  \n\nHowever, care should be taken not to exaggerate the significance of standardized IMAs. In some corners of the investment services market, notably hedge funds, clients confront complex contracts that lack the transparency and disclosure typical of standard IMAs. This leaves them with a choice of either having to accept these types of contracts or incurring the transaction costs involved in negotiating the proffered terms and conditions line by line and provision by provision. For many clients who rely on fee-for-service external legal advisers, the transaction costs involved can be a significant constraint on the willingness of parties to negotiate. As a result, these providers may produce a type of 'standardized’ contract that does not carry the approval of the relevant industry associations and professional bodies, but nonetheless is ‘accepted’ industry practice. The willingness of clients to accept these types of contracts in niche segments of the market is often legitimated by claims of superior financial performance.  \n\n### Contracting in London  \n\nThere are many accounts of London's domination of the European financial services industry (for example, Clark 2002; Faulconbridge et al. 2007). London provides a deep market for the services needed to function in global financial markets; it casts a significant shadow over Europe's financial centres. As Gilson et al. (2013) anticipated, London provides off-the-shelf standardized contracts for a wide range of financial services. Standardized contracts often come with the approval of relevant industry associations and professional bodies, the advice of consultants and law firms, and the tacit approval of the UK financial regulator (notwithstanding the exceptions noted). When coming to London to purchase financial services, including investment management, European financial institutions rely on the experience and expertise of London-based institutions. Reliance is reinforced by low transaction costs and claims of accepted convention legitimated by practice, both of which are often not available at home.4  \n\nBy writing contracts in London, or by writing contracts that require settlement in London, purchasers of financial services rely on the form and functions of UK law. Whereas it is easy enough to understand the functionality of the legal system, the formal properties of UK law are desirable in their own right. In part, this is because of the independence of the UK judiciary and the equitable status attributed to claimants in the legal system. Its reputation for adjudicating disputes on the merits of the issues provides claimants with confidence that their interests will be respected, even if they should not win.5 Furthermore, close consultative arrangements between the City of London, Bank of England, and financial regulators ensure that events or cases that would render adjudication problematic are used to fine-tune the relevant supervisory processes (McCormick 2010). Finance, law, and geography are bound together in ways that sustain the status of London in the global financial services industry in much the same way that Delaware dominates the US market for corporate governance (see Gilson et al. 2013).  \n\nIt should be emphasized, however, that few contractual disputes find their way to the ombudsman or to alternative dispute resolution processes. There are three possible explanations for this. First, the parties that use the standard IMA believe that provisions for governing contractual relationships are fair and equitable. Second, the transparent nature of the judicial system carries with it the prospect of reputational damage should investment managers violate the norms and conventions associated with the implementation and execution of such agreements. Third, the widespread reliance on London as the site through which to contract financial service providers is such that it provides clients with the opportunity to legitimate decision-making—even if mistakes are made in the governance of those contractual relationships.  \n\n### Contracting in Offshore Jurisdictions  \n\nIn the section ^Contracting in London', we explained why financial institutions from continental Europe and beyond find London a desirable jurisdiction in which to write contracts with global financial service providers. It is apparent, however, that UK and European financial institutions also write contracts in jurisdictions beyond the immediate reach of the courts of England and Wales. For example, Dublin and Luxembourg are financial centres that specialize in certain types of financial services that provide tax-related advantages for both principals and agents. In this section, we are less concerned with European tax havens than offshore jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands (Wainwright 2011; W6jcik 2013). Far-off jurisdictions give financial service providers like hedge funds opportunities to write contracts with distinctive governance characteristics.  \n\nOne difference between UK IMAs and the contracts offered in offshore locations is simplicity. Investors are typically offered an application form to purchase shares in a notionally self-governing fund administered by agents located in those jurisdictions, but managed by agents located in London. Application forms include provisions for the legal status of applicants, according fund administrators the opportunity to exclude certain institutional investors likely to demand greater transparency and accountability. According to the size of the investment, applicants are offered different classes of shares, some of which have voting rights. In many cases, the goals and objectives of the fund are broad and emphasize the style of investment. There may be little detail on the expected exposure to certain asset classes, target rates of return, risk budgets, and relevant benchmarks against which to judge performance. In some cases, clients have the right to sell their shares back to the fund (subject to terms and conditions). In other cases, clients must agree to long-term lockin provisions and the commitment of further assets over specified periods whatever the performance of the manager.  \n\nIn many cases, applicants are informed that the fund administrator and its agents have discretion over all matters pertaining to the fund's administration, management, and investment strategies. In some cases, applicants are given a fund Prospectus and a notice that the fund's Articles of Association are available upon request. If applicants purchase voting shares, they may be permitted to attend the annual general meeting of the fund held in the offshore jurisdiction. However, the power to appoint directors, set the agenda for annual general meetings, and purchase services from other agents typically resides with the fund administrator. The fund, its custodian, legal adviser, auditor, and investment manager are notionally separate legal entities. Yet, when deciding whether to invest in the fund, financial institutions interested in doing so normally receive presentations from the London-based investment manager. Whether by management and/or ownership, the offshore fund and its London-based investment service providers are intimately related (Wainwright 2011).  \n\nThis type of contract could be cast as relational in that it binds the parties together over the long term. In a formal sense, it has a governance structure that permits the representation of client interests. Whether or not clients hold voting shares and exercise their powers through the Articles of Association normally depends on whether they are willing and able to meet the threshold of investment required to claim voting rights, and wish to exercise those rights. The costs involved in exercising voting rights in offshore jurisdictions are significant, given that these types of investment vehicles are normally small components in most institutions' overall investment strategies. Consequently, it is not surprising that these contracts default to being purchasing agreements with little in the way of effective governance procedures. Here, form is an empty shell. Its functionality in terms of promised returns is the primary variable in deciding whether to enter into such a relationship.  \n\n# THE MAP OF CONTRACT  \n\nIn this chapter, we brought together the form and functions of contracts that bind asset owners to asset managers, noting that form (the laws of England and Wales) and function (the governance of the relationships between organizations) matter. At one level, the standard IMA has many properties consistent with a bilateral contract. It provides both parties with the opportunity to terminate any contract for investment services at will, with very little advance notice. The standard IMA also provides considerable detail in terms of the costs of services, the relevant benchmarks against which to evaluate performance, and reasonable boundaries on the asset classes and instruments deemed consistent with the investment mandate.  \n\nHowever, we have argued that the standard IMA is actually a relational rather than a discrete contract and, as such, is used to govern the relationship between parties. In this respect, the standard IMA dampens opportunism, limits overreaction to short-term events, and provides investment managers with a timeframe through which to demonstrate skill and expertise. If, as Kahneman (2011) contends, investment management promotes an illusion of skill, treating bilateral contracts as relational allows asset owners a chance to judge service providers against competing options. Knowing this to be the case, investment managers seek to dampen short-term volatility in returns, while guarding against trends in longer-term performance that fall short of the relevant benchmarks. By this logic, parties to IMAs understand the game played on both sides of the agreement and willingly accept its rules. Continuity of contract is often explained in terms of inertia (a behavioural predisposition). Here, we explain it by reference to the advantages of maintaining relationships, market risk, and uncertainty.  \n\nBy this assessment, both sides of the market have an interest in converging on a standard or accepted form of contract. This is made possible by industry groups and professions with a stake in facilitating or deepening the market for financial services; in the absence of a widely accepted form of contract, institutions would more than likely try to avoid the transaction costs involved in designing, negotiating, and executing bespoke agreements. As indicated in Chapter 4, the largest institutions would probably substitute contracts for financial services with employment contracts for the personnel they use to produce these services inside the organization. Intermediation is made possible by the standardization of contract and, most importantly, the ready acceptance of one jurisdiction as the reference point for industry standards. The supply of, and demand for, UK contract law is a crucial ingredient in explaining the European map of the financial services industry and the geographical patterns of intermediation.  \n\nWe have also sought to show that contract can vary between jurisdictions; for example, offshore financial centres can offer governance regimes that are quite different from those that dominate the investment management industry of the United Kingdom and Europe. Financial institutions willingly accept a form of investment contract that effectively denies them an active voice in its governance. This type of contract appears to be relational in that it binds the parties together over the long term with, in some cases, limits on withdrawal and mandatory periods of lock-in. Yet, notwithstanding the formalities associated with the governance of this type of arrangement, few investors have powers consistent with the effective governance of this type of arrangement. In effect, this type of arrangement is more consistent with a bilateral contract than with a relational one. Parties to these types of arrangements know the differences between standard IMAs and the types of agreements found in these offshore jurisdictions.  \n\nEven if investors have rights over the governance of these types of arrangements, they are very difficult to activate and carry through on a consistent basis. Why, then, do investors agree to terms that seem to violate the notional advantages of relational contracts? Here, there are three explanations. First, investors may come to believe that the standard IMA is a means of capturing clients rather than an equitable self-governing instrument. Investment management companies find refuge in these types of agreements as mechanisms through which to manage client expectations. This is especially important when asset owners have neither the time nor the resources actively to engage investment managers on issues that directly benefit their interests. Second, because in any event the industry as a whole may validate the standard IMA, rewriting these agreements can be a very expensive proposition without any certainty of producing cost-effective, superior rates of return.  \n\nThere is a third, less obvious explanation. The existence of alternatives to the standard IMA and related expectations about its governance and execution are often strategic elements in asset owners’ ongoing search for influence over the costs and benefits of contracting with the global financial services industry. In many investment portfolios, offshore providers running with asymmetric bilateral investment management contracts are relatively small components of institutions investment programmes. Therefore, for example, the types of investment strategies that hedge funds based in offshore jurisdictions pursue are often different from those provided by the global investment houses that utilize the standard IMA across asset classes. A subtle and often-unacknowledged connection exists between the investment strategies of entities that require clients to sign up to asymmetric bilateral contracts and those that provide standard investment services. Asset owners use the existence of alternative investment managers based in offshore jurisdictions to impose discipline on larger providers in the global financial services industry.  \n\n# IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS  \n\nHow financial institutions are managed, how their geographical scope is sustained, and how they are governed in relation to the network of service providers within and across markets are vital topics in our research programme. Here, we have extended the analytical framework established in earlier chapters to the nature and governance of contractual relationships in the industry, with particular reference to the place of London in the European market for financial services. In part, this chapter is about the design and functional performance of different types of contractual forms (bilateral and relational contracts). It is also about the special place of offshore jurisdictions in the market for financial services relative to continental Europe and London. Wojcik (2013) suggests that these offshore jurisdictions provide ^action spaces' for financial leverage and arbitrage. In this chapter, we have also pinpointed offshore jurisdictions as strategic elements in the governance of the contractual relations between asset owners and asset managers.  \n\nAt one level, our conception of contract is quite conventional: it is how financial institutions govern their relationships with the financial services industry. It is argued that the form of contract is an important element in framing the relationships between these parties and has a number of important dimensions, including its place in the institutional framework of the state. As such, the form of contract, its design and documentation, and the proper ways in which these instruments are executed, are all reliant on the legal edifice.  \n\nWe also show that contract has a number of important functions, including binding parties together over time and space in the context of financial market risk and uncertainty. Contract governs opportunism and the possibility that agents may exploit asset owners because the latter are unable to discriminate systematically between managers who are lucky’ as opposed to 'skilled’ in realizing rate of return objectives. To illustrate the ways in which these types of contracts are performed, we focused on three different strategies: in situ contracting, contracting in London, and contracting in offshore centres.  \n\nOur geography of contract' is rather different from the standard models that emphasize the role of contract as the means of realizing intended transactions. It is also different from more recent theoretical treatments that emphasize bilateral over relational contracts (Bolton and Dewatripont 2005). In our analysis, the sharp differences sometimes attributed to bilateral and relational contracts are less important than how they perform as governing devices designed to sustain relationships. By emphasizing governance, we have discounted contract as the embodiment of moral obligation or commitment, a thread of argument evident among legal scholars (Fried 1981; Kimel 2005). Nonetheless, it is apparent that the nature and performance of financial contracts are embedded in social and political formations (nation-states). Here, we have argued that form alone is insufficient to explain the use of contract as a means of governing commercial relationships over time and space (Dixon 2012; cf. La Porta et al. 1998; Thakor 1996).  \n\nTwo implications follow from our analysis. One has to do with the ongoing debate about the significance of London for the global financial services industry. In some quarters, London casts an unwelcome shadow over continental Europe, subjugating domestic financial institutions into what some commentators disparage as casino capitalism (Sinn 2010). On the other side of the Atlantic, commentators rail against the continuing importance of London for international financial transactions. By our account, London thrives because of the density of market intermediaries found in the city (compared with the major financial centres of continental Europe) and the fact that these services are available in a jurisdiction that offers accepted contractual terms and conditions, underpinned by a judicial apparatus that promises adjudication on its merits if need be. That there are so few cases brought to court about the performance of contracts for financial services suggests that the form, functions, and performance of these contracts is thoroughly internalized into customary practice.  \n\nOur analysis of contracts in the investment management industry also pinpointed significant shortcomings in customary practice. The standard IMA carries with it certain advantages and disadvantages; it is a means of economizing on transaction costs, for it relies on familiarity and broad acceptance to gloss over the fact that it can be a mechanism for holding hostage clients with neither the resources nor the sophistication to rewrite contracts in their interests. Being a mechanism for governing relationships, the standard IMA tends to reinforce past commitment in circumstances where expert judgement may reasonably call for a reassessment of terms and conditions in the light of the performance of suppliers. On the other side of the market, providers offer simplified contracts that require levels of deference and delegation that clients would otherwise reject if suggested by major multinational service providers. That these rather different, even competing. forms of contract coexist in London, and are available to local, European, and international clients, suggests that customary practice is contested (albeit obliquely).  \n\nBetween capture and coexistence is the strategic use of contract by clients to manage their service providers. To do so may involve, for example, discounting standard IMAs and forsaking the simplified contracts of offshore providers in favour of bespoke ones that explicitly serve the interests of clients, rather than clinging to the assumption that the parties to financial contracts are notionally equal partners? in the process of investment management. Here, of course, financial institutions may face significant barriers in realizing their ambitions to manage contract strategically. Few institutions have the resources necessary to design bespoke contracts, and even fewer have enough resources to oversee their implementation and compliance.  \n\n# NOTES  \n\n1. For an exception, see Argyres et al. (2007), who report on a case study of the evolution of contract-making in the US information technology (IT) industry between an unidentified company and its service providers (also not identified). Their study has the virtue of making time an explicit consideration in a wider theoretical treatment of the design and development of private contracts.   \n2. There are various legal regimes around the world, based on quite different principles and historical traditions. La Porta et al. (1998) argue that English common-law regimes are more consistent with the imperatives driving global financial markets than many other types of regimes (notably continental European traditions). By their account, the global financial services industry gravitates to jurisdictions that rely on English common law, avoiding (when given a choice) other more restrictive or inflexible regimes. Our argument is consistent with this thesis, although we do not assume that the map of legal regimes is necessarily determinate of the nature and scope of global financial markets (see Clark and Wojcik 2007).   \n3. See also Faulconbridge's (2008) work on the structure and management of multinational law firms. He suggests that the interchange of legal professionals within and between these global companies aids the diffusion of templates and their sequential revision and recalibration to fit changing circumstances.  \n\n4. Asset owners often seek advice from legal advisers on the industry status of various types of contracts, relying on the norms and conventions in the industry to justify acceptance of terms or conditions that would be thought unacceptable in other jurisdictions or industries. This practice is consistent with the history of contract law and the deference shown to the terms and conditions of contracts willingly undertaken by parties to private contracts (see Eisenberg 1998).  \n\n5. There have been few UK instances of a contractual dispute over investment management coming to open court. The most celebrated case is Unilever Superannuation Trustees Ltd v Mercury Asset Management (c.2000), which was settled just prior to the start of proceedings. A recent case (2012) involved a UK fund manager and a group of its clients. The latter charged the former with changing the composition of its investment product beyond that allowed by the contract. The court held in favour of the fund manager. This case is exceptional, and may have harmed the reputation of the fund manager more than the claimed variation in investment strategy damaged the substantive interests of the plaintiffs. See Certain Ltd Partners in Henderson PFI Secondary Fund II LLP (A Firm) v Henderson PFI Secondary Fund II LP (A Firm) [2012] EWHC 3259 (Comm).  \n\n6. Clients are often unaware of the tax benefits that accrue to financial service companies (especially their principals) domiciled in offshore jurisdictions. Associated with these arrangements are back-office processing and compliance operations, the costs of which (local wages, office space charges, and telecommunication fees) are much lower than in London and New York. These benefits are often emphasized in beautyparades'.  \n\n7. Investment managers may be better able to shelter their fund-related earnings from UK and US tax authorities in offshore jurisdictions if they use local rules and regulations pertaining to the treatment of such earnings. This can benefit the principals of such funds and spill over to employees via the payment of bonuses. This type of arrangement may be less attractive to large, diversified investment managers where ownership is diffuse.  \n\n7  \n\n### Public-sector Contracting for Investment Services  \n\nA significant slice of the US financial services industry, representing more than $\\$2.5$ trillion in assets under management (AUM), is dedicated to state and local public employee retirement systems (PERS) (Novy-Marx and Rauh 2009). These schemes cover approximately 18 million members, make payments to 8 million beneficiaries, and likely directly affect the current and expected welfare of more than 20 million dependants (Munnell 2012). When the indirect effects of public pension and health-care benefits are taken into account, state and local PERS effectively underwrite the long-term economic welfare of many US communities. Even so, US state and local PERS face challenging issues, in part reflecting the adverse consequences of the global financial crisis (GFC) for all investors and, in part, the increasing indebtedness of state and local governments—-the sponsors of public-sector pension schemes. The bankruptcy of Detroit is representative of systemic financial problems at all levels of government.  \n\nThe funding and performance of state and local PERS are important topics of research and public policy in their own right (Giertz and Papke 2007; Yang and Mitchell 2007). Because proffered pensions are typically defined benefit (DB) as opposed to defined contribution (DC), concern has been raised about the financial integrity of PERS (Beshears et al. 2011; Brown and Wilcox 2009; Glaeser and Ponzetto 2013). Concern has also been raised about the ineffectiveness of public accounting standards used to report scheme funding levels and liabilities (D'Arcy et al. 1999; Munnell et al. 2011). Furthermore, unlike their private-sector counterparts, which are subject to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), it is arguable that the jurisdiction-specific nature of state and local retirement schemes provides opportunities for rent-seeking at odds with the best interests of both the beneficiaries of the plan and of taxpayers (Andonov et al. 2016; Lowenstein 2008; Mitchell et al. 2000).  \n\nIt is tempting to treat US state and local pension systems as an integrated whole, as we do when conceptualizing and analysing financial institutions, markets, and regulation (Friedman and Kraus 2011). Whereas US private pensions—-whatever their home jurisdiction—-are subject to federal regulation, state and local public pension schemes are not. The patchwork of laws and regulations arguably reflects a bygone era of US federalism, which paid homage to state powers and the virtues of local arrangements consistent with local ‘non-commercial interests (Schapiro 2005).1 Not surprisingly, there are wide variations in state and local governance and management practices on PERS (Monk 2009). Even so, critics contend that the procedures many state and local pension systems use to purchase financial services, including pre-contract screening devices such as state-mandated requests for proposals (RFPs), impose significant transaction costs on service providers bidding for contracts. Missing in this debate is research on the form and substantive content of RFPs among US state and local PERS; these devices frame the contractual process and set terms and conditions that affect the contracting for investment management services.  \n\nMaking sense of the form and content of RFPs and investment contracts is challenging. While state and local governments may disclose the basic terms of service contracts, it is difficult to gain access to RFPs and the contracts themselves (as intimated in Chapter 6). We are able, in some instances, to report on PERS model RFPs and investment management agreements (IMAs). However, most RFPs and contracts are proprietary documents. Legal penalties apply should confidentiality be violated. The fact that PERS contracts are often subject to partisan commentary and debate reinforces caution about public disclosure. Interviews with senior managers of US public-sector pension institutions covering a range of topics and stretching over more than a decade have sustained our research on the governance and management of PERS (Clark 2008; Hagerman et al. 2006). As such, this chapter is an exercise in analysis and documentation grounded in knowledge of service agreements and contracts gleaned from fieldwork, freedom of information (FOl) requests, and intensive searches of state and local PERS websites.2  \n\nUS state and local pension funds are embedded in social and political situations not of their making. At one level, this is a truism: institutions do not exist in a world of their own; they are made, if not as mirror images of their sponsors’ interests, then certainly as expressions of the confluence of social forces that conceive of them as solutions to apparent problems (Granovetter 1985; Stewart 2011). As a consequence, institutions can be more or less effective in realizing their assigned tasks and functions (Roe 2006). Pension funds are also embedded in the global financial markets (as indicated in Chapter 6). In this chapter, we argue that the local dominates the global in the sense that the sponsors’ procurement rules and regulations dominate the contractual process. This is unusual by international standards. We demonstrate that éembeddedness gives rise to a remarkable diversity in contractual norms and conventions—among states, within states, and within major metropolitan areas. We also argue that the effect of embeddedness has been to sterilize contractual agreements with providers.  \n\nIn the next section, ‘State and Local Pension Institutions', we provide a brief overview of the US state and local PERS sector, noting its economic significance and distinctive institutional ecology. This leads to a discussion of the stasis of this sector compared with the institutional dynamics of financial services and financial markets. Subsequent sections are devoted to the structure and content of RFPs, the models of contract apparent on the client side of the market, and lessons to be learned from a close reading of Illinois state and local Chicago IMAs. The long-term viability of Illinois state and local pension schemes are in doubt because of chronic underfunding and the collapse in discount rates occasioned by the GFC and quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve (GAO 2012). In the penultimate section of the chapter, we briefly comment on the ill-fated proposal to establish the Oregon Investment Corporation (OIC). Had the legislation been passed, it would have given OIC the powers to bypass many of the public procurement rules and regulations that currently inhibit contractual relationships with external providers.  \n\n# STATE AND LOCAL PENSION INSTITUTIONS  \n\nRelying on US census data, Munnell (2012) noted that there are approximately 3,418 state and local government retirement schemes. Most of these provide benefits to police and firefighters and are very small in terms of the number of members and the volume of financial assets (Munnell et al. 2013). By contrast, 107 state and 19 local pension schemes service 88 per cent of the total number of enrolled members and 83 per cent of all the financial assets. In some cases, these state-based schemes are universal' in the sense that they cover all state employees. In other cases, there are separate state-based plans for government employees and teachers. In others still, as in Massachusetts (Hagerman et al. 2006), the state-based schemes consist of multi-employer investment platforms that pool and invest the contributions of various state and local pension plans.  \n\nThe vast majority of state and local government employees participate in DB plans that offer automatic cost-of-living adjustments. DB plans promise a retirement benefit based on final income and years of service (Clark and Monk 2008). DC plans provide a benefit based on the accumulated investment returns on contributions net of costs.? Munnell (2012) showed that in 1975 public and private employees had similarly high rates of DB pension-plan coverage. By 2010, 97 per cent of state and local government employees were covered by a DB plan, whereas only 26 per cent of private employees were covered by such plans.4  \n\nThese differences have only widened in the intervening years. State and local government retirement plans are designed, like most pension plans in the AngloAmerican world, to be funded in the sense that the value of invested assets should match expected future liabilities (D'Arcy et al. 1999).  \n\nThe size of plans varies within states, between states, and across regions. In large part, these differences are driven by population, the size of major cities, and, more generally, a political commitment to the quality of public services. There are many small- and medium-sized funds, some large funds, and a small group of mega public-sector funds with more than a million participants and hundreds of billions of US dollars in assets. Mega funds include the California PERS, the New York State and Local fund, the Ohio PERS, Texas Teachers, the Florida Retirement System, and California Teachers. These systems are large by global standards (Clark and Monk 2011). At the other end of the spectrum, the City of Austin, the Denver School system, the Maine Local system, the Phoenix PERS, and Vermont State Employees have each about 15,000 members and less than $\\$2$ billion in AUM.  \n\nMany states have two large funds, typically separating state and local employees from teachers. There are also states with more than two funds. For example, Illinois has five large funds—Illinois Municipal (386,000 members), Illinois PERS (127,000 members), Illinois Teachers (365,000 members), Illinois Universities (190,000 members), and Chicago Teachers (60,000 members). The size of an institution is important, since it affects the nature and sophistication of the resources available to give effect to its goals and objectives. This fact of life underpins our research on best-practice pension-fund governance (Clark and Urwin 2008a). There are also significant economies of scale in processing information—a necessary condition for mobilizing fundspecific assets such as the skills and expertise of employees (Amin and Cohendet 2004). Given the significance of financial risk and uncertainty for realizing pension-fund objectives, effective governance is a vital ingredient in fund performance.5  \n\nTo facilitate the process of negotiating and agreeing service contracts, the industry has developed a set of model contracts that are designed to meet the normal expectations of clients and thereby economize on legal fees and the costs of negotiation. These IMAs have two obvious virtues. Smaller funds gain access to the products and services of the major players without incurring significant transaction costs, thereby obtaining a wider variety of investment products than would otherwise be available to these institutions. To the extent that model contracts are recognized as equitable and effective, small and large pension funds can use these devices to limit claims for special consideration by local or favoured service providers. Of course, model IMAs are subject to client-specific adaptation and negotiation (especially if large funds have their own staff capable of fine-tuning agreements). Even so, many pension plans have adopted standard IMAs without negotiation or amendment.  \n\n# PENSION FUNDS: FORM AND FUNCTIONS  \n\nSuccessive pieces of US federal and state legislation have attempted to clarify and rationalize the proper form of a pension fund in relation to its beneficial purposes. Inevitably, legislation has often sought to solve past problems rather than anticipate the future (for example, the US ERISA, which the Studebaker debacle prompted). It is important to note that these institutions are not subject to competition for the right to provide pension income to beneficiaries. Instead, they have exclusive responsibility for collecting, managing, and investing pension contributions in accordance with terms and conditions found in statute, ordinances, and collective bargaining. Many have been in operation for more than fifty years and carry pension entitlements for at least another fifty years. By any account, these are remarkably long-lived institutions underwritten by their sponsor communities.  \n\n### Governance and Management  \n\nA board of trustees comprised of political appointees and representatives of the employer, employee, and retiree, normally oversee US public-sector pension plans. In some cases, the state treasurer is the designated chair of trustees, managing a board that can include representatives from the governor's office. Given the electoral cycle, there can be considerable turnover in board membership, especially among the political appointees. Indeed, partisan political debate can envelop board members as state and local officials jostle for attention in the lead-up to elections. In large multi-employer public-sector funds, boards can have as many as twenty members. These funds carry a variety of interests that can complicate board deliberation when it comes to the formulation and implementation of investment strategy.  \n\nBoards typically employ the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief investment officer; they then delegate functions pertaining to the administration, management, and operation of the institution to this executive cadre. Delegation may be accompanied by itemized responsibilities. In the absence of such mandates, customary practice frames executives roles and responsibilities subject to board approval (in general and on specific issues). In many cases, boards are quite heterogeneous with respect to members? skills and expertise in matters pertaining to the management of the fund. By convention, delegation is accompanied by deference to the skills and expertise of fund executives and employees. However, there can be close personal connections between board members, state and local political elites, and senior executives. These institutions are both sponsored by the community and can be held hostage to local interests in ways not so obvious in private-sector financial institutions.  \n\n### Norms and Conventions  \n\nPublic-sector pension plans are subject to reporting requirements on participants’ expected benefits, funding levels, and funding assumptions. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, although local pension plans normally must abide by state rules and regulations. Importantly, reporting standards and requirements are rather opaque, leaving considerable discretion in reporting to funds and their sponsors, compared with the more exacting requirements found in the private sector through the Financial Accounting Standards Board (Andonov et al. 2012). Some commentators argue that the accounting standards used in the public sector disguise the nature and scope of plan liabilities in state and local pension plans (Brown and Wilcox 2009). NovyMarx and Rauh (2009) suggested that state and local pension plans were underfunded (in 2008) by as much as $\\$3.23$ trillion. Whereas US privatesector DB plans are underwritten by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), state and local public-sector pension plans are ‘underwritten? by local taxpayers (Lowenstein 2008).  \n\nPension-plan investment is subject to the norms and conventions associated with finance theory (Merton and Bodie 2005). Modern portfolio theory (MPT), the efficient market hypothesis, and the norms associated with risk pricing (for example, the Black-Scholes theorem) inform Anglo-American pension-fund investment, including US public-sector pension plans. As noted in Chapter 6, public-sector plans are significant consumers of the products and services that the global financial services industry offers. For example, many public funds invest in index-based global equity portfolios. In large part, modern interpretations of fiduciary duty hold sway. So, for example, large diversified portfolios of securities are deemed consistent with the roles and responsibilities of plan trustees. Notwithstanding public commentary on the issue, few public-sector plans actively lobby corporate managers or campaign on behalf of the common good (for an exception, see Hebb and W6jcik 2005).  \n\nState and local pension funds share a form and many functions consistent with similar types of organizations found in the Anglo-American world. It is an organizational form that has been replicated around the world, finding expression, for example, in national pension reserve funds (Clark and Monk 2011). Having a shared purpose and similar functions, state and local plans are both more than and less than a universal institution. Embedded as they are in the community, their legitimacy relies on reciprocity, interdependence, and alliance formation (see Grabher (1993: 8-10) on loose coupling among local elites). Being embedded in the community can mean having to compromise on the means chosen to realize plan goals (Bunderson and Reagans 2011). Recognizing the possible costs of loose coupling, plan sponsors and funds may formulate complex procurement procedures so as to protect against unethical behaviour including bribery and corruption’ (Texas Municipal Retirement System, Investment Policy Statement, Section XIII, December 2012: 18).  \n\n# CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS  \n\nAs discussed in Chapter 6, pension plans produce the services they need either internally by employing the requisite staff, or externally through purchasing the services they need from the market via service contracts. This is the ^makeor-buy option'. However, in public-sector pension plans, the choice of insourcing versus outsourcing can be quite problematic because of the public scrutiny of fund salaries and benefits, and the application of standard procurement policies to the purchase of diverse financial services. Given their monopoly over the provision of pension benefits, it is not surprising that there are relatively few instances of organizational innovation in the sector. Alliances, networks, hybrid organizations, or joint ventures with other public plans are rare (see generally Helfat et al. 2007).  \n\n### Employment Contracts  \n\nThe standard US pension-plan employment contract matches that of its governmental sponsor or sponsors. As in most bureaucracies, employment contracts are job-specific, with wages and benefits set in accordance with occupation-related schedules and the compensation practices found in the government sponsor. After a probation period, employees are typically provided with continuing contracts subject to standards of conduct in public life. It is widely recognized that PERS salaries and benefits are not competitive with those found in the marketplace for similar types of jobs. There has been public commentary on proposed legislation in Oregon regarding the benefits of establishing an independent agency responsible for managing public-sector pension assets and liabilities (see Keith Larson's statement to the Senate Finance and Revenue Committee of 13 March 2013). Whereas much of the financial sector has been subject to mergers, acquisitions, restructuring, and periods of mass layoffs (and hiring), employment contracts in the public pension-fund sector are characterized by continuity, albeit without lucrative incentives and bonuses.  \n\nThe offices of public-sector pension plans are often located in second-tier cities, along with those of their government sponsor or sponsors. By being located some distance from the market for financial services, the skilled employees of public pension plans may effectively give up opportunities to switch jobs and so benefit from the escalation of income that often comes with market density (Dixon and Monk 2014). Recognizing the problems related to the recruitment and retention of highly skilled employees, one response by public-sector pension plans has been to outsource the provision of those skills. Recognizing that some types of advanced financial services command an unassailable market premium, another response by public-sector pension plans has been to pursue a hub-and-spokes organizational strategy. Located at the core of the institution are planning and management responsibilities, sustained by commercial agreements with market intermediaries to supply related and complementary services consistent with realizing the goals and objectives of the organization.7  \n\n### Pre-contract Screening  \n\nIn much of the financial industry, clients conduct beauty parades? orchestrated by third-party consultants who evaluate vendors against the mandate and the related terms and conditions. In large funds, internal managers often perform this function, for they have the information and knowledge necessary to discriminate between competing service providers. In the public sphere, mandates are typically advertised in trade publications and on institutions' websites. Companies wishing to be considered are required to respond in accordance with official RFPs. These documents normally include the terms and conditions required by the relevant state and local governments (fund sponsors). In some cases, government agencies vet the vendors to determine their eligibility against a priori criteria and lists of preferred providers.  \n\nThe standard RFP details the process whereby bids are to be made, the estimated value of the contract, the expected start and finish dates, the nature of the mandate (asset class and style of investment), and what is required in terms of an explicit commitment to state and local policies and procedures. Normally, this is a confidential process. Bidders may neither communicate with other possible providers nor directly contact the institution and its officers. Linked to the standard RFP are related documents of policies and procedures. In many respects, these are rulebooks that set out detailed defin-- itions, selection procedures, required commitments and information, and the mechanisms by which competing bids are assessed and the winner notified. The screening process often excludes the opportunity for negotiation over, or variation in, the advertised terms and conditions.  \n\n### Commercial Contracts  \n\nThere are significant transaction costs associated with writing commercial contracts for financial services. In public-sector pension funds, the process of contracting for external services is highly formalized and often includes the boards of trustees. In part, their involvement is a means of educating trustees about the goals and objectives of the fund as well as the nature and scope of opportunities in the marketplace. In any event, trustees often insist on being involved because the choice of provider is an important decision for any pension fund. Binding procedures are a way of discounting the claims of certain external vendors for special consideration, while legitimating the choice of service providers to the public at large. In these ways, the use of RFPs to structure the bid process, combined with standardized and nonnegotiable contracts, treat investment services as any other product or service purchased by public agencies. In many cases, few allowances are made for the contingent manner in which financial returns are produced.  \n\n# CONTRACTS AND TEMPLATES  \n\nHaving chosen preferred providers by asset class and investment product, deal-specific negotiation can expose public-sector pension funds to a number of challenges. Lacking the expertise of providers, funds can be taken advantage of when agreeing to terms and conditions in deal-specific negotiations. In addition, board members and senior executives can claim roles in the negotiation process, adding costs and/or complexity to the desired agreement. In any event, the high turnover on boards due to the electoral cycles of state and local governments means that some of the most important board members may be ignorant of crucial issues. Given that opportunism is an ever-present threat to the integrity of contracting (Williamson 1999), it is not surprising that precaution via mandated procedures and terms and conditions is the ruling ethos of the sector.  \n\n### Content of RFPs  \n\nIn this context, government sponsors of public pension funds and/or the funds themselves tend to converge on one or a number of default options that, in effect, replace deal-specific negotiation with off-the-shelf solutions. As noted, many state and local pension funds utilize RFPs as a mechanism for prescreening the commercial providers of financial services. In these cases, RFPs are required by state and local governments, and are overseen by state attorneys’ offices and the like. The disadvantages of screening devices are well known: the detail required of potential service providers when bidding for contracts is not always consistent with the imperatives driving financial markets. One response has been for industry bodies, such as the Investment  \n\nManagement Consultants Association (IMCA), to produce model RFPs for investment services applicable to state and local PERS.  \n\nThe first part of the IMCA model RFP provides a summary of the required services, the necessary qualifications of consultants, and instructions on how to submit proposals, including a four-page statement on confidentiality. Thereafter, respondents are required to answer nine questions on “firm strength and stability', twelve on the “investment process', and thirteen (covering three sub-sections) on ^service′ provision, including performance reporting and fees. The second part (comprising twelve pages) provides a detailed exposition of the organization's investment objectives, policies, and guidelines, including statements on delegated authority, investment strategy, asset allocation, and asset classes. The Kentucky Teachers′ RFP for investment consulting services has a similar structure, many of the same items and questions, and a standard statement on terms and conditions (comprising eighteen single-spaced pages). As a consequence, the Kentucky Teachers’ model contract for consulting services is simply a set of statements on the consultant's obligations (six single-spaced pages). The Nevada PERS contract for investment advice, on the other hand, is only one-and-a-half pages long.  \n\nAs for investment management services, an Internet search was initiated to identify state and local PERS that disclose RFPs to the public. In addition, a series of requests for information were lodged with state institutions, seeking the release of information on RFPs and model contracts. The Los Angeles County PERS provided a set of three RFPs—-one for custodial services, one for active emerging markets equity, and one for real estate equity. The two equity RFPs had almost identical structures and contents, running over twenty-nine to thirty pages each. In each case, the first few pages dealt with the purpose, required qualifications of bidders, work requirements, and the bid process. The following three pages described the fund, its powers, confidentiality requirements, and a stipulation that bidders could not alter their proposals during the course of contract negotiations. Thereafter, another ten pages were devoted to the fund's requirements, including certifications by bidding companies and bidders′ organization, management, and transaction histories. The last seven pages were devoted to questions on bidders? experience, investment philosophy, and performance in the relevant asset class and related products. The RFP for custodial services had a similar structure but required more information from bidders (spread over nearly eighty pages).  \n\nThe detail involved in many PERS RFPs is such that the US market for financial services has become Balkanized, or differentiated according to the willingness of industry providers to deliver information on their business models and expertise. Furthermore, the structure and contents of these documents emphasize procurement policies and procedures rather than the realities of investment in global financial markets. It is notable that the Los Angeles PERS RFP for document photocopy services is similarly extensive, running to nearly eighteen pages, with many of the same headings and items as the investment RFPs (excluding the pages devoted to matters such as asset classes). In effect, formalism dominates the RFP process, being insensitive to the substantive nature of the service sought; as the photocopy instance illustrates, bid procedures often lack proportionality, thus treating minor service arrangements as they would service agreements for major items, including investment services.  \n\n### Templates, Terms, and Conditions  \n\nNonetheless, a number of state and local PERS have formulated their own model contracts or IMAs for investment services. To characterize the contractual templates utilized by US state and local pension funds, an Internet search, and FOI requests for information about IMAs were made to US states and cities with pension and retirement benefit schemes. In the first instance, we identify the PERS that require service providers to respond to model IMAs. In the second instance, we compare model IMAs in terms of their substantive content, referencing categories of terms and conditions as well as the extent to which each fund included or excluded specific items. As to the first issue, in a small number of cases, state and local funds use model IMAs that match standard industry IMAs. In one case, the standard IMA, which ran to twenty-two pages, was accompanied by a fund-specific investment policy document that ran for more than seventy pages. The policy document overwhelmed the IMA, emphasizing the duties of providers relative to the prerogatives of the client.  \n\nSome twenty-seven funds were identified that either allow the public to view their model RFPs and/or IMAs or responded to our FOI requests (see Appendix). Six of these came from Illinois. Two—the Illinois Universities Retirement System and the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund—were statewide funds, while four—the Chicago Park Employees Fund, the Chicago Transit Authority Trust, the Chicago Teachers’ Fund, and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation Fund—-were Chicago-based. Included in the twenty-seven were some of the country's largest pension funds, such as Los Angeles City Employees Retirement System (LACERS) and California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) from California, the Kansas PERS, the Minnesota Teachers' Fund, the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System (SERS), and the Texas Municipal Fund—as well as smaller funds such as the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund. More specifically, these funds control as much as $\\$630$ billion in assets, representing the Midwest, the southwest, California, and the Mountain States. Most funds had between $\\$10-50$ billion and $\\$50–100$ billion in AUM, while CalPERS ranks as one of the world's largest funds.  \n\nTo summarize the size and scope of the model IMAs obtained from our twenty-seven institutions, we undertook a series of assessments of each  \n\n![](images/263d191ae6e8421d44da6862c1df617c5b0bd71989e24efc4292b56aedec2f19.jpg)  \nFigure 7.1. Word count and clauses in IMAs Source:Authors  \n\nIMA. In terms of the number of words making up each IMA, Figure 7.1 provides a histogram showing that about 50 per cent of the IMAs were between 5,000 and 7,000 words in length. Less than 20 per cent of IMAs were between 2,000 and 4,000 words while 10 per cent were more than 10,000 words. As for page length (not included in Figure 7.1) 40 per cent were between fifteen and twenty pages, with 20 per cent being either ten to fifteen or twenty to twenty-five pages in length. In what follows, we look in more detail at the categories and items making up the model IMAs. In Figure 7.1, it is shown that IMAs varied widely in terms of their itemized conditions or clauses (within categorical headings). As such, it is possible to conclude that (a) IMA diversity is an important attribute of the sector, and (b) diversity is not only an issue of form (the organizational structure of IMAs), it is also an issue of substance (the content of IMAs).  \n\nTo illustrate these points, Table 7.1 lists the IMA items or clauses shared by the 27 funds, working from a 100 per cent down to a 60 per cent share of the 110 items or clauses identified across the 27 fund IMAs. The twenty-five shared items are hardly surprising in that they establish the significance of state law, the relevance of fiduciary duty, the start date of contracts, and the means by which an agreement may be terminated. Notably, most of these agreements appear open-ended without an end date (which is normally provided in RFPs). At the other end of the spectrum, Table 7.2 provides a summary of the nine IMA items that do not appear in more than one fund. Model IMAs come with a termination date in only one instance. Many other items appear relevant, though some are more important than others. For example, it is significant that only one fund provided for the resolution of ‘problems or disputes'. It is also remarkable that one model IMA would protect the selected investment manager from any acts or omissions by... a broker dealer'.  \n\nTable 7.1.

On the other hand, many IMAs include items that refer to specific requirements. For example, some funds require the  identification of investment managers’ authorized representatives, others require investment managers to ensure the security of deposits, and others still give quite detailed instructions on the nature, scope, and timing of investment manager reporting. Few share requirements regarding conflicts of interest, soft-dollar arrangements, proxy-voting requirements, ethical policies, and the like. It is noteworthy that less than 33 per cent of the funds shared most items.  \n\nTable 7.2.

Fund (sixty-eight), CalPERS (sixty-four), and LACERS (sixty-three). Those with the fewest items included the Nevada PERS, the Louisiana State Employees system (twenty-three), the New Mexico Education Board (twenty-four), and the Ohio Police and Fire Fund (twentynine). In general, funds with the fewest items tended to have one or two requirements for most categories (such as fiduciary duty), whereas those with many more items tended to have more requirements under each category heading. Funds with the fewest number of items were also those that tended to exclude some categories altogether, such as proxy voting, ethical investment, or provisions against side-payments. The size of fund (AUM) was not associated with the number of categories or items.  \n\nWe expected to see a close resemblance between local IMAs, reflecting shared learning and experience, and the loose coupling often associated with jurisdiction-specific political coalitions (Grabher 1993; Storper and Venables 2004). When comparing the Illinois state-wide funds, the Universities? fund $\\$11$ billion AUM) and the Illinois Municipal fund ( $\\$25$ billion AUM), however, we found significant differences both in the numbers of items (fiftytwo against twenty-nine) and in the substantive content of each template.  \n\nWhereas the Universities’ fund required its investment manager to disclose any pending legal proceedings or disciplinary actions against the company or its employees, as well as any subsidiaries and the amounts of monies likely to be transferred through the agreement, the Municipal fund did not. The Universities? fund also required the IMA to specify what entity would have physical control of the assets and cash and how proxy votes were to be handled, while the Municipal fund did not.?  \n\nAs for the Chicago funds, there were obvious similarities (apart from the Transit Authority fund, which had far fewer items than the other three). Where the other funds identified the relevant custodian, the applicability of state law, and the possibility of varying the IMA at the discretion of the fund, these items were not found in the Transit Authority fund. The latter did not include two statements regarding the exclusive interest of the fund relative to the investment manager, which are included in the IMAs of the other three Chicago funds. The Transit Authority fund was also different in that it gave investment managers the discretion to exercise their powers of proxy voting, yet did not require them to keep detailed records of their proxy voting actions. The three funds used categories consistent with the state-wide funds. However, the overlap is not so consistent as to suggest that there was a common template shared at the state and Chicago metropolitan levels.10  \n\nThere was an intriguing difference between the Illinois Universities’ fund and the Municipal one. The Board of Trustees of the former consists of four elected (active) members, two elected (retired) ones, four appointed by the governor, and a chair; the governor appoints the latter who furthermore serves as chairperson of the Illinois State Board of Higher Education. The governor's appointees are, quite obviously, political and, in recent years, they have brought considerable expertise in financial markets to the board. The Municipal fund's Board of Trustees, by contrast, has three elected (active) members, one elected (retired) member, and four who are nominated and appointed via the participating units of the Ilinois local government. The Universities' board is less parochial than that of the Municipal fund, for it includes members with knowledge and understanding of financial services.  \n\n# COMMONALITIES AND DIFFERENCES  \n\nBased on our research on state and local PERS procurement procedures, it is apparent that any contract for financial services offered by a US public-sector pension plan is embedded in an ensemble of statutes, policies, and procedures. The substantive content of such contracts are to be found, in the first instance, in requirements that exist prior to the contract for services. In large part, these requirements are not subject to negotiation—they are conditions by which any service provider must abide when accepting a contract. These requirements reflect the interests of various community groups, as well as a common interest in awarding contracts to those most likely to meet a priori requirements. These types of requirements may or may not be consistent with realizing the financial objectives of public pension funds. Many issues are included in these requirements, reflecting public policies and commitments that often match the character of local jurisdictions. Given the diversity of US states, cities, and communities, it is not surprising that there is considerable variation among jurisdictions in the nature and scope of requirements.  \n\nWe do not mean to imply that community interest in the investment policies of public pension funds is, in any sense, illegitimate. Rather, the issue is whether local ensembles of statute, policies, and procedures are conducive to the formation and execution of contracts that are consistent with the long-term financial integrity of pension schemes. Also at issue is whether the process of contracting offers enough freedom (discretion and delegation of powers) to use the contract as an effective means of governing ongoing commercial relationships. More often than not, these types of contracts are precautionary', in the sense that they are written to forestall any embarrassment that otherwise might be visited on the political sponsors of state and local pension funds. As a consequence, in the US public pensionfund sector it is difficult to use contracts for financial services in flexible and strategic ways within the process by which contracting is framed and executed (as suggested by Weber and Mayer (2011)).  \n\nIt was also found that a number of large and small public-sector pension funds have adopted an IMA model not specific to the jurisdiction. Adoption can be a signal to market providers that, whatever the strictures involved in the procurement process, fund boards and officials expect a level of performance consistent with industry norms. Adoption of an IMA model may also signal a level of expertise and experience relevant to the industry, thereby implicitly discounting the importance of the formal RFP process. This may be especially significant in the larger funds, which have people on their management boards who have experience of and responsibilities in industry. To the extent that boards have the authority and responsibility to select providers from shortlists of qualified contenders, the IMA framework may be used to discriminate between potential providers (in subsequent rounds of review). Nonetheless, it is entirely possible for the overarching procurement process to subsume the substantive significance of IMAs.  \n\nIt was found that a number of large state-wide public-sector pension plans have adopted model IMAs, suggesting that their size, significance, and ongoing relationships with industry providers have encouraged these institutions to imitate related practices found in the private sector. However, it is not simply an issue of financial size and significance by state of jurisdiction. It was also found that Illinois state-wide and local pension funds have adopted the IMA framework. This is either the result of peer pressure, innovation via a follow-the-leader process of diffusion, or policy initiatives encouraged by the governor, state treasurer, or state legislature. Notice, however, that funds have not adopted a standard IMA. Rather, the models vary in terms of their categories and items (substantive content). As such, the commonalities among funds in relation to Mllinois RFP procedures are not carried through to the design of a common Illinois IMA. The implication is that fund-specific political considerations drive the IMA design process, even if Illinois RFP procedures encourage formal similarities.  \n\nA variety of factors can explain the persistence of state and local PERS. These include the constitutional powers of state governments, the fiscal circumstances of different jurisdictions and their related PERS, and the difficulties associated with coming to an agreement with different groups of public employers, unions, and occupations. It is arguable that the coexistence of state and local PERS in Illinois and elsewhere comes at a cost, although it may be difficult to identify those costs because they are absorbed in the governance and management of specific institutions. Likewise, it is difficult to estimate the costs of RFP procurement policies compared with (possibly) more flexible IMAs. Nonetheless, a number of states have sought to reform the structure and management of their public pension systems, and to impose state-wide investment institutions or platforms shorn of the impediments associated with public procurement policies.  \n\nTo bypass the possible costs of politicization, the State of Oregon brought to the legislature a proposal to establish the Oregon Investment Council (an advisory body) as the Oregon Investment Corporation (OIC). If Senate Bill 120 had been accepted, the OIC would have been responsible for investing the assets of the Public Employees Retirement Fund (PERF) and a large group of related government funds, including the Oregon University System Fund and the Local Government Employee Benefit Trust Fund. In many respects, the proposed OIC had many of the attributes of institutional best practice, including a relatively small governing body comprised of directors qualified by virtue of their financial experience and skill (see Clark and Urwin (2008a) on best-practice governance). Furthermore, the mandate of the OIC was to be relatively well defined, and the rules governing the behaviour of board members and fund executives were based on prudence and the fiduciary duties of loyalty and impartiality. In this respect, it could have been a model institution, realizing the benefits of scale and with a licence to contract external providers in line with industry norms rather than local standards.  \n\nThe 2013 legislation required the fund to abide by state regulations regarding its independence from the State of Oregon and the latter's employers, the purpose of the fund, and what would have counted as being a prudent investor. Crucially, the legislation exempted the fund from many existing state regulations, including those relating to personnel relations, public facilities, public contracting and procurement policies, standards of financial administration including budgeting and expenditure, the salaries and expenses of state officers and employees, and the administration of public funds. For example, state policies regarding treatment of specific classes of individuals, categories of service, compensation regimes, and selection processes and procedures would be the responsibility of the OIC. In effect, the OIC would have had the power to establish its own procedures consistent with the tasks and functions attending an investment institution rather than being required to adopt the public procurement policies required of state institutions. The OIC would also have the power to build its own investment capabilities and negotiate contracts for services consistent with industry practice.  \n\nHowever, there was one aspect of the original legislation that would have undercut the best intentions of the sponsors of the legislation. The legislation provided for a governing board consisting of five voting members and one non-voting member. It also gave the state governor the power to appoint four of the voting members, provided they were ‘qualified’ by virtue of their ‘training and experience in the field of investment or finance'. The state treasurer would have been the fifth voting member and the director of the Public Employees Retirement System was identified as the board's sixth (nonvoting member). Consistent with past legislation, the terms of the appointed voting members of the board was to be four years (with reappointment for another term possible).11 However, each member would have ^serve(d) at the pleasure of the governor and may be removed from offce with or without cause'. In effect, the governor would have controlled the board, whether directly or through the threat of termination. It is arguable that this is consistent with the precautionary ethos that is evident in the governance practices found in the US state and local pension-fund sector. Nonetheless, it is inconsistent with the principles of best practice evident, for example, in appointment procedures and policies that insulate governing boards from the political cycle and direct political influence (Clark and Monk 2011).  \n\n# IMPLICATIONS ANDCONCLUSIONS  \n\nDiversity is a key characteristic of US state and local pension systems (Mitchell and Smith 1994). Many funds utilize rather limited IMAs, and are normally idiosyncratic rather than consistent with sector- or industry-specific norms. In any event, of the 120 larger US public-sector funds that account for the majority of US public employees enrolled in pension saving schemes and the vast majority of AUM, only about 20 per cent of funds have introduced model IMAs. Most funds use the RFP process to set the terms and conditions that govern the provision of investment management services. Our research demonstrates the extent to which the market for financial services in the US public pension-fund sector is Balkanized, implying significant transaction costs for both the buy side and the sell side of the market. While there is evidence of a neighbourhood effect influencing the form and content of public-sector funds' model IMAs, this effect is more often found at the city or metropolitan level than among funds within states or between funds of adjacent states.  \n\nIn many jurisdictions, state-mandated and local policies dominate the procedures through which public pension funds purchase financial services and products. RFPs and related policy documents set out specific requirements, as well as the rules and regulations that govern bid processes and selection procedures. Contracts written in the shadow of these policies and procedures are shallow documents, more often precautionary in intent and effect than enabling transaction-effcient commercial agreements. Contracts for investment services reflect state and local political interests and commitments, denying the utility of standardized IMAs so as to give effect to the financial interests of communities across the United States. This reinforces the bid process rather than the effective execution and realization of value through ongoing contractual relationships. As noted, this also tends to Balkanize the market for investment services across the sector, limiting suppliers to those comfortable with sector and jurisdiction-specific RPF and certification procedures.  \n\nIn these circumstances, adaptation to changing market conditions has been relatively slow, especially with regard to the mix of asset classes, investment products, and providers. In the open-ended relational contracts typical of the investment management industry, by contrast, adaptation can be quite responsive to market conditions—albeit subject to recurrent rounds of amendment and negotiation. This may account for the fact that state and local pension funds have been slow to revise the expected rates of return downwards, or to change their assumptions about expected discount rates. It is arguable that these assumptions are embedded in inflexible systems of service procurement and sterile contracts for investment services. Many funds would find it diffcult to reconcile desired flexibility in investment strategy with a lack of flexibility of asset allocation strategies, the terms and conditions imposed on investment managers, and variation in those arrangements as markets change.  \n\nThese observations are no doubt familiar to informed commentators on state and local pension funds. However, as Munnell (2012) has observed, differences among funds in terms of their rates of return have proven to be difficult to explain. Econometric models using common independent variables such as board composition have not been particularly successful as predictors of fund-specific rates of return. We have suggested that the differences between states in the nature and scope of RFPs, and in the related rules, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the procurement of investment services, are significant. These differences provide insight into how and why some public funds are more adaptive to market conditions than others. If Lo (2012) is correct in arguing that adaptiveness to risk and uncertainty is a prerequisite for superior investment performance, it may also be a prerequisite for the survival of US state and local pension systems.  \n\n# NOTES  \n\n1. Attempts have been made to establish common US standards of public-sector pension-fund management through the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and, specifically, the Uniform Management of Public Employee Retirement Systems Act (1997) (Volume 7A Pt. II). This model code focuses on holding assets in trust, prudent investment rules, and disclosure consistent with ERISA and more recent federal court decisions regarding the nature and scope of fiduciary duty (Willborn 1998). To date, only two states have adopted this regime.  \n\n2. FOI conventions rarely apply to state and local PERS. For example, disclosure by the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System (PSERS) is governed by the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know (RTK) law (65 P.S. & 67.101 et seq.). This means that information requests are ^granted to the extent that the records exist and are public'. Further, according to the RTK legislation, ‘agencies are required to provide public records, not answer questions. See the Response by the Pennsylvania PSERS 29 January 2013 to Public Records Act Request by Stanford University 22 January 2013. In a similar manner, the Missouri Local Government system indicated that they have a model IMA but were unwilling to disclose it to us, indicating ^we believe this document is an attorney-client work paper and therefore falls under the exceptions of public viewing in Missouri's Sunshine Law (Missouri's FOIA law)' (email 23 January 2013).  \n\n3. States such as Alaska, Michigan, and Rhode Island have introduced other kinds of pension savings schemes, including 401(k) and hybrid or mixed schemes. Agnew and Hurwitz (2013) provide a comprehensive inventory of state-based pension and retirement saving schemes.  \n\n4. It is likely that many older private-sector workers also carry with them DB entitlements from past employers (public and private). Job switching rarely involves consolidating benefit entitlements, unless workers switch between employers in a sector that provides an umbrella pension benefit institution. To the extent that private-sector employees are offered pension benefits, the standard benefit is now DCnotDB.  \n\n5. Size is not everything. The ratio of retirees to active participants tends to drive the fund risk budgets, asset allocation formula, and equity exposures. Being relatively small can accentuate the opportunity costs of being mature, while being large can provide even mature funds with options not otherwise available to smaller, less mature, and more risk-tolerant institutions (Ambachtsheer 2007).  \n\n6. These estimates and the assumptions on which they are based have been widely disputed; see the report of the Government Accountability Office (GAO 2012) and  \n\nthe commentary published in Pensions é Investments, 21 January 2013, p. 10, by Keith Brainard (research director of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators).   \n7. In some cases, being on the margin of markets has been made into a virtue via the recruitment of skilled employees who are assigned responsibilities in high-value segments of financial markets to which they would not otherwise have access until later in their careers at major investment houses. With continuity of employment, there is an opportunity for skilled staff to invest in their human capital to realize long-term career aspirations. With market turmoil, job security with responsibility is an investment in future career options (Dixon and Monk 2014).   \n8. Service providers to the sector may prefer highly detailed rather than open-ended terms and conditions. This is because the former provide explicit limits to the nature and standard of services required, while the latter may mean that the service provider becomes hostage to the changing preferences of clients. With political intrusion in matters relating to service provision and providers, precaution may be as important to providers as it is to the sponsors of retirement plans.   \n9. The Houston Firefighters fund, Maine PERS, North Dakota Investment Office, Kentucky PERS, and San Diego County fund all indicated that they do not use model RFPs or IMAs. The Ohio PERS indicated that it uses a model RFP and the Missouri Local Government fund and Pennsylvania PSERS indicated that they use a model IMA. The Public Safety System of Arizona indicated that while the state has a procurement code, it was exempt from its provisions.   \n10. This is not surprising given the tensions occasioned by the often different party affliations of the Illinois governor and Mayor of Chicago, as well as differences in the party-political make-up of the Illinois legislature and City of Chicago assembly. One way of characterizing these differences is to refer to ^downstate’ Republicans and big-city Democrats. Similar tensions are found in many US states where rural and ex-urban interests are at odds with those of the major metropolitan centres.   \n11. See, for instance, Oregon Laws and Resolutions 1967 (Chapter 335, Sec. 2) and Oregon Laws and Resolutions 1987 (Chapter 877, Sec. 1) referring to the constitution of the board of the Oregon Investment Council.  \n\n### APPENDIX  \n\n### State and local retirement benefit systems included in the analysis of model IMAs  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">State and local retirement benefit systems</td><td colspan=\"3\">US dollars in 000s (as at 30 June 2011)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Actuarial funding ratio (%)</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Types of plans offered</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Asset market value</td><td>Annual contributions</td><td>Annual benefit payments</td></tr><tr><td>California</td><td>California Public Employees'Retirement System</td><td>243,015,119</td><td>0</td><td>14,670,473</td><td>83.40</td><td>DB</td></tr><tr><td>California</td><td>Los Angeles County Employees?

In many cases, asset owners try to find and make contracts with multifunctional financial service organizations, discounting, where possible, the costs and consequences of going to the market for each separate but related financial service. Even multifunctional financial service companies combine insourcing with outsourcing by subcontracting those activities that they cannot produce internally in an effective manner to specialist service providers (see Chapter 5). In this respect, intermediation has at least three dimensions—between savers and financial institutions like pension funds, between financial institutions and service providers, and between service providers (paraphrasing Diamond 1984).  \n\nPlanning the production of financial returns typically involves entities that advise pension funds on the selection of organizations that provide investmentrelated services (Goyal and Wahal 2008). This is another dimension of intermediation, describing how the demand for financial services is intermediated, as is the supply of financial services. It is standard practice for asset owners such as endowments, foundations, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds to rely on intermediaries, including actuaries and investment consultants, to determine the nature and scope of the financial services needed to realize their investment objectives. It is also standard practice for these types of intermediaries, which we define as ^consultants', to search the marketplace (local and global) for relevant service providers, ranking them in terms of performance and reliability, and conducting beauty parades? at which shortlisted providers pitch their virtues to clients (Shleifer 1985).  \n\nIn this chapter, we focus on the role of the consultants who advise clients on investment strategy and implementation.1 There is a significant literature on the global consulting industry and management consultants (McKenna 2006). Here, though, there is less research, although there are strong opinions. Some critics view investment consultants as gatekeepers standing between asset owners and the global financial services industry, thereby controlling access to the ultimate decision-making on a preferential basis (Coffee 2006). Going further, Youngdahl (2013) contended that investment consultants have undue influence over clients, often exploiting their privileged position to gain long-term contracts, high fees, and even kickbacks. Knight and Dixon (2011) argued that investment consultants have stifled innovation because they have little incentive to go beyond industry norms and conventions. Doubts have also been raised about the value of investment consultants, and the money management industry in general, as revealed by the performance of investment managers and products (Gennaioli et al. 2015; Jenkinson et al. 2015).  \n\nInvestment consultants do more than sell ^solutions to problems specified by the client' even if ^consultants are represented as independent, objective advisers with superior know-how' (Gluickler and Armbrüster 2003: 277). Investment consultants are essential to the investment performance of small and medium-sized asset owners, and even for some large investment institutions. They tend to have long-term relationships with these organizations and provide crucial services, including skills and expertise either unavailable in these organizations or, if available, insuffcient in relation to financial risk and uncertainty. Contract is one of the threads holding these relationships together. Many funds are limited in their power to bargain the terms and conditions of service agreements. Yet, investment consultants often place a higher premium on equitable relationships than on exploiting their market position, so seek to maintain market share via standardized contracts (see Choi and Triantis (2013: 55) on the ways in which market strategy mediates bargaining power in contract negotiation).  \n\nIn this chapter, we provide an analytical account of the various roles of investment consultants; we examine how and why their roles vary in relation to the size (assets under management (AUM)) of clients and the ways in which they can foster or stand in the way of innovation. The chapter begins with a discussion of the theory of intermediation, based on landmark papers in the field including Allen (1990), Allen and Santamero (1998), and Diamond (1984), as well as Gorton and Winton's (2003) survey of the field as it relates to banking and finance. This is augmented by reference to the management literature on organizational capabilities and resources (Helfat and Peteraf 2009). There are useful synergies between these fields that deepen our understanding of the role of consultants in general and the role and responsibilities of investment consultants in particular. The third section of the chapter focuses on what investment consultants do, which touches on our earlier discussion (see Chapter 5) of what senior managers do in asset owning and asset management companies.  \n\nThis is followed by a stylized representation of the contractual relationships between asset owners and consultants, distinguishing between small, mediumsized, and large asset owners. We bring to light the subtleties of these relationships given the capabilities and resources of differently sized institutions. Going beyond functionalist conceptions of intermediation, we suggest that ambiguity is characteristic of these relationships. We argue that both parties may desire ambiguity because the production of investment rate of return is subject to market risk and uncertainty. Ambiguity in these relationships provides a space in which to adjust investment strategy and its implementation to unexpected changes in market conditions. This account of the virtues of ambiguity is informed by Hachigian (2015), and recent research on the importance of reflexivity in modern economies (Bathelt and Gluckler 2011). In the penultimate section, we observe that the benefits of ambiguity must be judged against its possible costs, particularly where industry norms and conventions entrench advisory relationships to the detriment of innovation.  \n\n# THEORY OF INTERMEDIATION  \n\nFor many analysts, the rationale for intermediation is best understood via the theory of transaction costs. In his treatise on the theory of the firm, Spulber (2009) argued that firms exist because consumers cannot get what they want from separate suppliers in a cost-efficient manner. This argument is obviously inspired by Coase (1937), who argued that the size of any firm is a function of what can be done efficiently within its boundaries, as opposed to outsourcing to organizations that provide intermediate goods and services. In this section, we consider two versions of this argument—-one found in financial theory and the other in management science. We show that these arguments converge on a number of counts.  \n\n# Financial Intermediation  \n\nIn the finance literature, the issue of intermediation is conceptualized in terms of the existence and functions of banks (or bank-like institutions) (Mayer and Vives 1993). Diamond (1984) began by asking why savers do not lend to investors directly: why are banks needed to manage the relationship between savers and investors? Diamond provided a set of interlocking answers. First, given that there are many savers, searching for investors and then overseeing or monitoring their actions can be, in the aggregate, very expensive. Second, there are likely to be free-riders who shirk responsibility for their share of the costs of searching and monitoring. Third, monitoring is an expensive business, with a premium on information—savers may be poorly placed to collect the needed information to make effective decisions.² In effect, it is assumed that banks provide two functions. First, utilizing their skills and expertise to realize investment objectives, they bring together and coordinate savers. Second, they expend scarce resources on monitoring the performance of entrepreneurs to the point where further monitoring is not repaid by better performance.  \n\nThis model has been developed in many ways-see, for example, Gorton and Winton (2003), who looked at the related research on the various functions of banks. Much like banks, institutional investors bring dispersed savers together, coordinate their interests in terms of desired investment returns, and then go about the business of investing the stock of assets in relevant and available opportunities according to target rates of return. Having realized investment gains or losses, these are then returned to savers. As we show in Chapter 5, many theorists believe the make-or-buy choice unproblematic, notwithstanding the very different implications attending the use of employment contracts (for the make option) and service contracts (for the buy option). Whereas Coase (1937) provided a rationale for insourcing versus outsourcing by focusing on the transaction costs of one mode of organization versus another, we have challenged his assumptions and the implications drawnthereof.  \n\n# Capabilities and Resources  \n\nThe theory of intermediation presupposes that financial organizations are flexible in that the switching costs between modes of organization are not a constraint on the choice of modes. In management science, transaction costs are also significant—witness the importance attributed to Williamson's (1975) theory of markets and hierarchies. Here, the issue is whether an organization or set of organizations facing a changing environment has the internal capabilities and resources necessary to respond in an effective manner. In our analysis, capabilities include the decision-making protocols by which organizations frame and implement strategies consistent with their goals and objectives. Resources are defined as the tangible and intangible assets of an organization.  \n\nThere is some debate about the distinction to be drawn between the terms ‘capabilities’ and ‘resources'. Amin and Cohendet (2004) do not use these terms but refer to an organization's competencies—how it processes and distributes information and knowledge given the premium on coordination. We have noted that coordination is a significant issue for many financial organizations, especially where senior managers are reliant on task- and domain-specific expertise. Helfat and Peteraf (2009) would merge the two terms, especially in a changing environment. Even so, we believe there is merit in maintaining the difference even if in certain situations investment consultants can be seen as ^resources' as well as ^capabilities'. As resources, intermediaries like investment  consultants add information  and knowledge not otherwise available within the sponsoring organization. As capabilities, investment consultants provide skills and expertise to underwrite the investment decision-making process (Clark and Urwin 2008a).  \n\nBy this logic, intermediation adds to an existing organization's capabilities and resources. This can be important because the latter are either unavailable to the relevant organization by virtue of its size and position in the market, or are so task-specific and expensive that few managers can justify holding them internal to the organization. At the same time, intermediaries can bring information and knowledge of the competitive environment that few financial organizations would be able to gather themselves. As such, the management literature on intermediation ends up in a similar place as the finance literature, for both suggest that search costs provide a rationale for intermediation.  \n\n# Organizational Form  \n\nThe theory of intermediation prioritizes functions over organizational form (see Merton and Bodie 2005). As such, we run the risk of functional essentialism in that this logic tends to ignore the histories and geographies of organizations and the ways these shape the conception and delivery of certain functions. This is not just an issue of degree; it is about the extent to which there is a match between an organization's capabilities and resources and its functional performance in realizing its objectives. In some settings and in some types of organizations, capabilities and resources may be so inadequate as to compromise the realization of their missions. Furthermore, a close match between functions and organizational form can be self-defeating. To the extent that the organizational structure lags behind functionalist imperatives, for instance because of management entrenchment and rent-seeking behaviour, organizational form can be a constraint on the nature and pace of innovation.  \n\nIn any event, functionalism is hardly an adequate representation of the evolution of organizations, financial or otherwise. As Roe (2006) observed, organizations are normally created for a variety of reasons, some of which cohere and some of which conflict with one another. For example, the express purpose of a pension fund is to reap the benefits of scale and scope in the provision of retirement income not available to individuals acting on their own account. However, few pension funds stand alone: their activities and interests are subject to their sponsors' separate and collective interests as well as the balance that must be struck between different generations of workers (savers) who participate in such organizations. Functionalist conceptions of organizations decry the costs associated with embedded claims and counterclaims for priority. Nonetheless, these types of organizations exist because they are coalitions of interests, notwithstanding the ambiguity about their proper purpose and functions.  \n\nVagueness about the purpose of an organization may be the price paid for its existence. Lack of clarity is one meaning of ambiguity (see Heath and Tversky 1991; cf. Ellsberg 1961). Ambiguous goals and objectives can have adverse consequences for decision-makers and their performance in financial markets (Epstein and Schneider 2008). Ambiguity often characterizes an organization's decision space, where issues and possible solutions are left unstructured to facilitate negotiation and agreement. In this chapter, we suggest that ambiguity about consultants’ roles and responsibilities vis-a-vis their client organizations can be beneficial to both parties and desired as such (contra Fox and Tversky 1995). There need not be one ‘right organizational form if uncertainty is characteristic of the environment (Hachigian 2015).3  \n\n# WHAT DO ADVISERS DO?  \n\nIn what follows, we provide a schematic framework of what investment consultants do in three different types of pension funds—small, medium, and large. Our framework is also applicable to endowments, foundations, family offices, and sovereign wealth funds, though it is not our intention to demonstrate empirically its relevance to these organizations. Size matters because it is, in part, a proxy for organizational capabilities and resources. Nonetheless, we are mindful that size can be a significant constraint on realizing the value of embedded capabilities and resources. Size begets complexity and complexity can adversely affect coordination, thereby discounting the notional advantages of size—these points were developed in previous chapters, notably Chapters 3, 4, and 5.  \n\n### Case 1: Small Fund, Representative Board, Wholly Outsourced  \n\nWe assume that a small fund is an organization that manages less than ${\\mathrm{U}}S\\$5$ billion in assets and liabilities. This assumption is somewhat arbitrary given that being ‘small does vary in relation to the jurisdiction and origin of an organization. We also assume that a board, representing the fund's stakeholders and including its sponsor and beneficiaries, governs the fund. Again, the composition of such boards can vary by jurisdiction and type of sponsor (Tilba and McNulty 2013). Finally, we assume that, to fulfl its mission, this type of organization buys the functions it needs from the market for financial services. While the fund has employees, it is assumed that they help to administer the process of selecting providers, including their oversight.  \n\nIn this case, our stereotypical fund works through a two-tiered model of governance in which the board delegates the implementation and oversight of investment strategy to an investment subcommittee comprised of a select number of board members. Ultimately, the board receives the subcommittee's recommendations, which it either accepts or rejects. In this case, the investment adviser provides the relevant capabilities and resources appropriate to framing investment strategy and its implementation through the selection of asset managers and related service providers. In other words, the investment adviser enables investment decision-making. Indeed, given the composition of the board—-and often a lack of relevant capabilities and resources—-the investment adviser is the means by which investment strategy is conceived and realized.  \n\nThis arrangement has three dimensions. First, the relationship between the client and consultant is one of mutual dependency. Without the investment adviser, the board would be unable to make effective investment decisions and would lack the means by which to implement its investment strategy. Even so, the nature of the contract binding the parties together is framed in such a way as to provide the client with the right to terminate the relationship ^at will (for example, subject to a month's notice). It is assumed that the client's threat of termination is what ^controls' the adviser. Second, a conservative culture tends to dominate investment decision-making. Widely accepted concepts and tools, appropriate to the investment subcommittee if not the entire board, are used to frame investment strategy. Third, therefore, the relationship between the client and adviser references industry norms and conventions. Boards and their advisers find comfort in benchmarking investment strategy and fund performance against similar organizations (Shleifer 1985).  \n\n### Case 2: Medium Fund, Representative Board, Mixed Sourcing Strategy  \n\nIn this case, we could think of our idealized fund as responsible for assets and liabilities in the region of $\\$10-30$ billion. This is, by necessity, a crude approximation. Nonetheless, in relation to Case 1 and Case 3 insights are to be derived from elaborating the relationship between clients and investment consultants in this type of fund. In this case, the fund has a three-tiered model of governancethe board, the investment subcommittee, and an investment management committee. Whereas the board is representative of sponsors and beneficiaries, its members are selected, in part, for their knowledge and understanding of finance in general and, perhaps, investment in particular. Even at the lower end of the size category, the fund may have sufficient assets to manage a portion of its assets in-house, rather than out-of-house. In-house investing tends to be based on public markets and it utilizes the standard toolkit of investment management techniques, including portfolio diversification. Here, investment consultants are less concerned with enabling than with facilitating investment decisionmaking. They may also be important in providing information about the scope of market opportunities for investment. This can complement the implementation of investment strategy.  \n\nHere, the relationship between the fund and the investment consultant is best understood in relational terms, rather than in terms of the asymmetrical logic evident in Case 1. While the fund relies on the investment consultant, it does not depend on the adviser for investment decision-making. In effect, responsibility for investment decision-making and determining the means by which investment strategy is to be realized is shared. Furthermore, the investment adviser is able to act as a resource for the investment committee and, by extension, for the board as well as the management committee. One implication is that this type of fund can develop a process of investment decisionmaking to ensure that only strategic issues, rather than the day-to-day business of overseeing the performance of providers internal and external to the fund, come to the board. A second implication is that continuity and mutual learning mark the relationship between the client and the adviser.  \n\n### Case 3: Large Fund, Representative Board, Reliant on Insourcing  \n\nIn this case, our idealized fund has more than $\\$40$ billion in AUM. Because of its size, and its importance to the sponsor or sponsors, the board is likely to be comprised of individuals who have a representative role and knowledge of financial issues consistent with the mission of the fund, if not specifically about investment management. These rare individuals often command terms and conditions of appointment consistent with being a board member of a large corporation (Clark and Urwin 2010). This type of fund has a four-tiered governance structure with significant investment capabilities and resources located within the organization. The relationship between the board's investment subcommittee and the management investment committee is an essential element in the framing and realization of investment strategy. While the board is ultimately responsible for investment strategy, the knowledge located in the management committee and the governance of the relationship between the management investment committee and the investment subcommittee are crucial in setting the mandates for the fund's teams of portfolio managers, the fourth tier of the organization.  \n\nHere, investment consultants can have two rather different roles. At one level, they can provide members of the investment subcommittee with ‘independent insight and knowledge—a not-entirely welcome reality check on the aspirations of the fund's senior executives. To do so effectively, however, investment advisers must be embedded in the investment process to the extent that they understand both the issues and the logic, or rationale, underpinning the fund's investment strategy and implementation. Otherwise, consultants may start to compete with senior management, especially if they have a willing audience on the board of the fund. By necessity, such investment consultants are highly skilled individuals with a reputation to uphold. At another level, they also provide information and knowledge about the investment strategies of other similarly placed organizations.  \n\nThree implications are to be drawn from this particular case. First, the relationship between the client and consultant appears symmetrical in that the investment process honours the skills and expertise of the investment adviser in relation to those of the in-house team. Second, in reality, the relationship may be discrete in that its continuity depends on the consultant demonstrating value to the organization in which they serve. This is not a relationship of dependency or reliance; it is a relationship cast in terms of cost and benefit. Note that the board, through its investment subcommittee, may come to rely on the investment consultant to provide a critical perspective on investment strategy, otherwise absorbed by the institutionalization of the fund's investment decision-making process. Third, there remains a role for investment consultants that can bring to the client insight, information, and opportunities that the latter is unable to produce in the short or medium term. In this respect, the relationship is one of complementarity via substantive knowledge rather than dependence (Case 1) or reliance (Case 2).  \n\n# CONTRACTS AND SERVICES  \n\nIn the previous section, ‘What Do Advisers Do? we provided a brief framework for understanding the role of investment consultants in which we emphasized the size of clients and their systems of governance and management. This is one way of conceptualizing what consultants do. It is equally important, however, to acknowledge that investment consultants, like other service providers, do what they do through the medium of contracts for services. In principle, contracts for services provide both parties with legally enforceable agreements through which to pursue their mutually advantageous but separate interests (Bolton and Dewatripont 2005). In practice, however, contracts for services must be flexible enough to accommodate the various ways in which clients and consultants work together, while providing each party with a degree of detachment consistent with evaluating the costs and benefits of such relationships (Kimel 2005).  \n\nFraming and implementing investment strategy involves networks of consultants and service providers, each of which has a role in the process. In the United Kingdom, for example, actuaries clarify the goals and objectives of investment strategies with reference to asset plans and liabilities (or obligations). Once they have established the investment goals and objectives of an organization via a strategic asset allocation model, investment consultants provide information on the performance of various asset classes, investment managers, and opportunities. Legal advisers, in conjunction with the representatives of investment managers, formulate contracts for investment management services and, ultimately, the agreement of both parties. In many cases, a custodian holds and switches assets between clients and investment managers, while providing assurance that those organizations holding assets on behalf of clients do so effectively and efficiently. In some cases, a reporting agency collects performance data from the investment managers and reports back to the client. Overseeing this entire process are accountants and internal administrators.  \n\nThis characterization of the types of organizations that make up the investment management process is, no doubt, simplistic. Nonetheless, it provides a way of situating investment consultants in the financial services ecosystem. Notice that a separate contract governs each link in the chain. In many respects, these contracts are rather similar in form, if not in the functionspecific expectations of clients and providers. The global financial services industry relies on the laws of England and Wales to formalize the process of intermediation and govern the flow of capital around the world. This is also apparent in Europe, notwithstanding that the legal systems of some countries do not cohere with the laws of England and Wales (La Porta et al. 1998). The contractual templates for services provided by associations or organizations representing different types of intermediaries are also under this umbrella. In that they favour accepted norms and conventions to counter the high costs of negotiating bespoke contracts, these templates allow parties to economize on transaction costs.4 To avoid the costs of going to court, private agencies often offer arbitration mechanisms to help clients and providers resolve disputes (McCormick 2010).  \n\nStandard contracts covering accountants, actuaries, investment consultants, investment managers, and information providers share three common characteristics. First, they are typically open-ended in terms of duration, but give clients the power to terminate at will. Second, they are typically silent on the precise nature of the services provided and, more often than not, refer to its type—for example, ‘actuarial services'. Third, they typically provide a statement of fees. In these ways, they are rather shallow documents that rely on industry norms and conventions on matters such as what comes with an agreement between a client and an actuary, or a client and an investment consultant. Industry respondents report that side letters and/or appendices with detailed terms and conditions, covering topics such as the liability of service providers, the protection of intellectual property, non-disclosure to third parties, and much else besides, often accompany standard contracts.5 In sum, contracts are more than signed agreements: they are sets of documents that map the scope of engagement while providing frameworks for collaboration (Davis 2013).  \n\nAt one level, it could be argued that clients have a powerful lever over service providers, especially investment consultants and investment managers, when the instrument binding the parties together enables the client to terminate the agreement with minimum notice. It would seem that this type of standard contract is, or should be, in the vernacular of contract theory, a bilateral contract that can be voided and/or renegotiated as the client desires. It might also be argued that the threat of termination is sufficient to ensure that the relationship between the client and its provider is equitable, even if it does not favour the client. However, the termination of such service contracts can come with significant transaction costs, including the winding down of service provision; the search for, and recruitment of, another provider; the transition between providers; and the upfront costs involved in situating the new provider in the chain of intermediaries that together manage the investment management process.?  \n\nNotice that contracts for services are typically between those nominated to represent the client and those nominated to represent the company that is providing the services. On the client side, assuming that the pension fund is the legal entity, those authorized to sign such agreements are likely to include the chair of the board and a subset of board members. On the service provider side, those authorized to sign such agreements are likely to include the company secretary, or the nominated offcers of the company legally entitled to sign such agreements. In substance, the service provider's ^client' is, more often than not, the board of the fund, whereas the ‘service provider’ is an individual or set of individuals whom the service provider employs. Those involved may change over time as board members leave their positions and new members are appointed, and as employees of the service provider either leave to take on other responsibilities within the company or leave employment with the company. Recognizing that the continuity of advisory relationships in part determines market share, investment-consulting companies are mindful of the value of maintaining these relationships, even if the individuals involved take on other responsibilities.  \n\nGiven the transaction costs involved in switching providers, as well as possible changes in the membership and composition of boards, what appears to be a bilateral relationship favouring the client can become, by necessity, a contract marked by continuity rather than disjuncture. This is a significant issue for any fund, whatever its size. Nevertheless, consider the case of a small fund governed by a representative board that outsources the production of investment returns. As demonstrated, the fund may have limited skills and expertise on its board and lack experienced staf through which to manage its assets and its relationships with service providers. In such cases, consultants provide clients with the needed capabilities and resources to function as organizations. Not surprisingly, to economize on the costs of providing services to any individual client, the consultants standardize the services they provide. Both sides of the market acknowledge, but rarely explicitly recognize, that customization in accordance with the needs of clients is an expensive proposition; by this logic, industry norms and conventions are, on average, functionally efficacious.  \n\nIn a medium-sized fund, by contrast, where the client relies on the investment consultant to facilitate investment decision-making and its implementation, the relationship between the client and the service provider is more equitable, if not entirely symmetrical. The costs of termination could be high, given the lack of suitable internal capabilities and resources that could compensate for the termination of such a crucial service. Nonetheless, a medium-sized fund may be able to plan for long-term changes in the nature and composition of the intermediaries that make up the investment management process. Furthermore, this type of fund may be able to bring relevant expertise in-house to ensure that reliance is mediated by informed judgement on the board and/or among its senior officers. This may be a win-win proposition in that external advisers are able to develop relationships with knowledgeable officers who favour innovation in the process of investment decision-making and the nature and scope of investment management. Alternatively, both parties may have a common interest in entrenching their positions.  \n\nIn large funds with developed investment-related capabilities and resources, the relationship between consultants and clients arguably favours clients over consultants. It would be possible to terminate consultants’ services with due notice without an immediate or appreciable loss of value to clients. What is valuable about an investment adviser in these circumstances? There are three possibilities. First, consultants and their companies may have specialized skills and expertise unavailable to organizations internally. Second, independent advisers may be a useful medium through which to interrogate the investment strategies of senior managers, testing assumptions and the plausibility of expected outcomes based on alternative sources of information. Third, consultants may be able to bring to investment strategies knowledge and understanding of the strategies of similar organizations otherwise treated as competitors. Continuity in these relationships depends on the value consultants bring to investment performance.  \n\nIn Figure 8.1 we summarize this discussion by reference to six criteria that describe how fund size affects the relationship between asset owners and investment consultants. Ranging from left to right across the figure, these are status (the nature of the relationship), function (what consultants provide clients in each instance), content (the material basis of the relationship), knowledge (what consultants add to any discussion of the issues), contract (the nature of the formal relationship between the parties), and value (the net contribution of the consultant to the client). Clearly, these criteria are related, overlap, and reinforce one another. For instance, a large fund is likely to value its relationship with an investment consultant to the extent that the latter's knowledge of key issues makes a substantive difference to the fund's investment performance. Having a contingent relationship based on adding value, clients could seek discrete rather than relational contracts.  \n\n![](images/a54c73a436b3ade853b956aca5bcf71d9a607ee284246c40816a576e25eab415.jpg)  \nFigure 8.1. Stylized account of the consultant-client relationship Source:Authors  \n\nNotice the differences between small and large funds across the six criteria. To enable investment decision-making, small funds depend on their advisers being focused on managing the process rather than the substantive content of the investment issues the clients face. Because clients have limited capabilities and resources, they expect consultants to have a wide knowledge of the field. At the other end of the spectrum, large clients are not dependent on consultants but treat the relationship as contingent and substantive, demanding specific knowledge in relation to their ongoing investment programmes and projects. That is, the value of the adviser to a large fund is measurable and may be subject to a performance-oriented contract. In between, medium-sized funds tend to treat consultants as resources, relying on their expertise for framing and implementing investment strategy rather than depending on them for the process of decision-making itself. While in some cases the difference between dependence and reliance may be slight, reliance can be managed whereas dependence may imply capture.  \n\nAMBIGUITY,CONTRACT,AND FINANCIAL MARKETS  \n\nIn the section 'Contracts and Services', we argued that the relationships between institutional investors like pension funds and investment consultants are governed by a type of contract that is open or ambiguous about the specific tasks and functions required by the client.7 Commonplace conceptions of ambiguity associate the term with something lacking coherence, precise definition, or accepted meaning. Presumably, it is something to be avoided or at least something to guard against. If so, it is perhaps surprising that contracts governing clients relationships with financial intermediaries are ambiguous about the precise tasks and functions an investment consultant must perform to be rewarded by fees and the reimbursement of costs. Here, however, are three objections to the commonplace presumption against ambiguity.  \n\nThe first objection comes from Merton and Bodie (2005). In their analysis of the institutional structure of modern financial markets, they argue that, notwithstanding the primacy accorded to individual behaviour in neoclassical economic theory, institutions play a key role in mediating and even resolving evident problems of coordination in episodes of market irrationality. By their account, the institutional structure of financial markets is a response to problems of coordination and agent behaviour: institutions provide a decisionmaking framework within which agents can go about realizing their separate goals and objectives. By necessity, the institutional structure of financial markets must have a degree of continuity or resilience that individual agents are unable to realize on their own account. The implication is plain: the open-textured or ambiguous nature of many service contracts is a desirable attribute rather than something problematic.  \n\nThe second objection comes from Keynes (1948), Knight (1921), and scholars who believe that financial markets, more than many other types of markets, are subject to risk and uncertainty. By this account, the opentextured or ambiguous nature of clients? service contracts with intermediaries is a necessity rather than evidence of poor governance, given that sometime in the future the client and the service provider might need room for manoeuvre to respond adequately to changing circumstances. For financial organizations that either depend or rely on investment consultants for investment decisionmaking and its implementation, an itemized contract specifying the tasks and functions of the consultant would be both expensive to oversee and a constraint on an organization's ability to respond to unanticipated shifts in financial markets. This objection links together the existence of uncertainty with the nature and scope of the transaction costs involved in repeatedly re-contracting.  \n\nThe third objection is entirely situational. Industry observers note that if contracts for services are ambiguous, they give the client opportunities to gain access to consultants' skills and expertise that go beyond the normal expectations of any such relationship. Here, two elements are in play. At one level, industry norms and conventions typically provide clients with ready-made expectations about the nature and scope of advice available through investment consultants. While it is a reference point, available at low cost to most clients, it need not be determinate. Clients can exploit the interest of investment consultants in the continuity of contract by pushing them beyond industry norms and conventions on a case-by-case basis. Put slightly differently, investment consultants can become the medium through which institutional investors learn about developments in the field. In doing so, investment consultants can empower their clients, so allowing them to change the relationship into one that is more equitable in terms of clients? knowledge and understanding of market performance and investment strategy.  \n\nThese three objections suggest that there is virtue to be had in opentextured or ambiguous contracts with investment consultants. Returning to Merton and Bodie (2005), it is arguable that this feature is common to the relationships between clients and intermediaries in financial markets and is a vital component of the institutional structure of the global financial services industry. It facilitates coordination over time; it mediates apparent tendencies towards under- and overreaction to financial market volatility; and it sustains flexibility within contractual relationships. A fixed contract with an explicit menu of roles and responsibilities could impose high transaction costs on agents, which may, in periods of significant market turmoil, threaten the stability of the entire financial system.8  \n\nEven so, ambiguity can bring significant costs. Norms and conventions, by their nature, reflect established practice, providing the yardstick by which to decide what is acceptable, unacceptable, and contested. Norms and conventions, by definition, also lag behind the leading edge of best practice, even if professional bodies and organizations legitimize them by certifying their efficacy. Lacking the skills and expertise to make their own judgements about the utility or otherwise of what are deemed contested modes of investment management practice, small and medium-sized funds cling to past practices until the latter fail in the face of changed circumstances. Clients then seek 'new? ways of doing things from consultants who, buttressed by industry best practice, reinforce their reliance on these organizations. There are three kinds of costs in these arrangements—the costs of convention, opportunity costs (relative to what may have been achieved), and the costs of coming late to the market where premiums have already been realized.  \n\nIn any event, contracts with consultants are typically silent on the performance of investment consultants, but not on issues such as best endeavours, conflicts of interest, and due diligence. Once again, norms and conventions shape client expectations in relation to what counts as a ^good' or bad' adviser. Moreover, in terms of investment performance, advisers do not take responsibility for the decisions that boards and committees take on investment strategy and its implementation. Enabling and facilitating decision-making is not the same as setting a short or long-term investment strategy. Investment consultants are deliberate about policing the boundaries of their responsibilities in this regard. Ambiguity on this matter is unacceptable to investment consultants, their companies, and the sector.  \n\nBeing embedded in epistemic communities of practice and entrenched in long-term advisory relationships protects investment consultants from the vagaries of financial markets and the possible arbitrary decisions of clients. This means that investment consultants are normally neither rewarded nor penalized for investment performance. This is also true of many institutional investors. Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and family offices typically have an exclusive relationship with the ultimate beneficiary-- in effect, they have exclusive control over the assets they manage. Merton and Bodie (2005) suggest that the ‘permanent nature of these organizations and their relationships to beneficiaries is a response to the probable costs of overreaction to short-term events.  \n\nNeither investment consultants nor the boards of institutional investors directly suffer the effects of poor performance, which insulates the former from accountability in the face of adverse events. It also minimizes any incentives that consultants might have to promote innovation and change in the face of market dislocation.  \n\n# MODES OF INNOVATION  \n\nIn theory, changes in the ^environment' in which organizations operate drive innovation (Rosenberg 1995). Most relevant to our interests, however, is the widespread belief that it is market disjuncture or failure that drives it (Scott 2008). By this account, shortfalls in financial performance should prompt clients to demand solutions from their investment consultants that break with the past and offer an alternative path or means for realizing their goals and objectives (Birkinshaw et al. 2008). Innovation can be found in the process of investment decision-making, in the mechanisms linking investment strategy and its implementation (for example, insourcing or outsourcing), and in the choice of service providers and investment products. None of this need be 'new' in the sense of invented'. There may be options that have been ignored because their salience was not apparent or proven.  \n\n### Market Disjuncture  \n\nIt is arguable that shifts in financial market performance over the past couple of decades have driven innovation in client-consultant relationships. This is not a new story; it has been told and retold over the past couple of decades in the aftermath of various financial crises. Institutional investors and policymakers alike have responded, in part, by rethinking their modes of practice and behaviour (Akerlof et al. 2014). Here, though, we focus on two aspects of the relationship between clients and consultants—-innovation in organizational form and function, and innovation in the norms and conventions underpinning the framing and implementation of investment strategy.  \n\nThe problem facing investors is that of distinguishing noise from signalnamely differentiating between market information that is simply a jumble of data in need of sorting and sifting for value on the one hand, and market information that is unequivocal about its implications for framing and implementing investment strategy on the other (Clark 2014). Previously, we have drawn attention to the path of the FTSE100 stock market index since 1984. There appear to have been three rather different episodes over the past thirty years. Episode 1, 1984-98, which saw a steady trend in stock market appreciation; episode 2, 1998-2007, characterized by an extended cycle from a peak (bubble) through a trough to another peak (bubble); and episode 3, post-2008, which the Bank of England characterizes as dominated by systemic risk. Left to the reader is the latest, episode 4, the period since markets were stabilized and economic growth returned to the UK and US economies only to be dampened by the euro crisis, Brexit, and the slowdown in the Chinese economy.  \n\nIn retrospect, one can readily describe each episode, but during each episode it was much more difficult to ^call' its characteristics and to frame investment strategy and its implementation. In the course of episode 1, it would have been relatively easy to make money via a passive index tracker. This period was, as intimated, dominated by benchmarking performance and switching between providers within asset classes according to relative performance (Shleifer 1985). As data accumulated on market performance, it became clear to academic researchers and investment consultants alike that switching between providers in a growing market was consuming scarce resources, including the time devoted to managing the switching process (Litterman et al. 2004). It was more effective to concentrate on longer-term asset allocation than on benchmarking performance. As large funds adopted this strategy, the practice became accepted in the industry and the investment consultants of mediumsized and smaller funds started to mimic the early adopters.  \n\nThe technology, media, telecommunications (TMT) bubble marked the end of an era (Shiller 2005). As global markets lost value, emerging market investment products came into their own. Initially, these products were amorphous in that there was little in the way of shared attributes or ways of summarizing their characteristics. Information about, and knowledge of, their underlying characteristics was at a premium. Investment consultants took the opportunity to compare options and tout winning products. Larger asset owners tended to adopt these types of products, deploying their own capabilities and resources to inform decision-making. This changed when Goldman Sachs coined the acronym ‘BRICS' (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa)—-a marketing device that gave emerging markets a recognized meaning and a benchmark from which to evaluate competing products. In effect,  \n\nGoldman Sachs sought to make a market for its emerging market product in an attempt to bypass investment consultants. Consequently, it brought many small and medium-sized funds into the market for emerging market products.  \n\nAnother narrative became important: labelled the great moderation, it foretold a future of economic growth and stability underwritten by low inflation and global integration (Blinder 2015). Asset owners were asked to look forward, rather than backwards, in framing their investment strategies. Lacking data on the performance of related investment products, vendors simulated performance. Seeking investment returns in the face of declining discount rates, asset owners, large and small, were receptive to alternatives. In this environment, investment consultants were often bystanders as the narrative gained credibility, as this story was justified by a theory of stock market capitalism that discounted the likelihood of market instability (Clark 2011). The global financial crisis (GFC) punished those who stayed too long in the bull market. Even so, it is hoped that the market will soon return to 'normal'.  \n\n### Innovation in Form and Function  \n\nMarket volatility has taught us three important things about the relationship between asset owners and investment consultants. First, more is expected of investment consultants, especially their ability to assess the likely performance of ‘new’ asset classes and investment providers. Even the smallest pension funds have re-evaluated their dependence on advisers in the light of low funding levels and the collapse in discount rates. Second, it has become apparent that while their business models depend on maintaining relationships with clients, investment consultants do not share the costs of poor performance, whether caused by market movements or by factors specific to individual funds. Third, there is a premium on innovation. In part, this is about recovering lost ground, but it is also about diversifying risk. Accordingly, the skills and expertise of investment consultants and their companies have become more important.  \n\nOne response has been to reconsider the form’ of the relationship between investment advisers and clients. Here, asset owners foreground the contract binding the parties together rather than leaving it in the background as is typical of most contracts (Kimel 2005). By doing so, clients signal that the industry norms and conventions underwriting expectations of consultants? roles and responsibilities are not necessarily consistent with asset owners' particular interests. As well, it suggests that the ambiguity inherent in these relationships is insufficient for clients to remake investment strategies in ways that take into account new market realities. Put slightly differently, where market disjuncture breaks with past industry practices and the available scope for incremental adaptation, asset owners are forced to confront their own inadequacies and the costs and consequences of conventional behaviour.  \n\nFor small pension funds, whose governing bodies are conscious of their dependence on consultants to frame and implement investment strategy, one response has been to outsource those functions via fiduciary management (FM) agreements. In effect, such outsourcing changes the organizational form of funds, leaving in its stead a new contract for services rather than the functions normally associated with a pension fund. This gives asset consultants an opportunity to frame and implement investment strategy more effectively. In essence, the related contract is for management ^performance’ rather than for facilitating the process of fund decision-making as if the managers of such funds were able to realize their objective (see Chapter 9).  \n\nFor medium-sized funds, also aware of their reliance on investment consultants in a changing environment, one response has been to intensify their relationships with service providers. Rather than maintain a relationship that is only periodically evaluated in terms of its efficacy, medium-sized funds have sought closer relationships with their investment consultants. This has had a number of effects. At one level, it has subtly changed the relationship from reliance to mutual engagement. At another, by intensifying the process of investment decision-making and drawing on the expertise of their asset consultants, medium-size funds have sought to understand the substantive issues better. In effect, asset owners have sought to redefine their relationships with consultants and go beyond the acknowledged ambiguity inherent in the scope of these relationships.  \n\nFor large funds, aware of their internal capabilities, resources, and possible power over investment consultants, their relationships with these service providers have been subject to review. In many cases, insourcing has raised questions about the benefits of asset consultants who have less knowledge and understanding of the issues relevant to such funds than the investment professionals that such funds employ. Equally, the identity of the ‘client' is less clear in these cases, especially if management committees have considerable scope in framing and implementing investment strategy. In such cases, contracts for services can be revised to focus on adding value to the knowledge of investment staff rather than facilitating the process of decisionmaking. As funds develop their own legal services, contracts with asset consultants have become bespoke rather than merely reproducing industry norms and conventions.  \n\n### Innovation in Products and Services  \n\nOver the past twenty years, emerging markets were brought to the global marketplace via products that packaged securities from selected regions of the world. For example, longer-term trends in middle-class consumption were brought to market via value-focused stock selection investment strategies, and hitherto untraded positions via investment partnerships and closed-end funds.  \n\nSome product innovations are notorious; witness the misleading risk-rated collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) based on the US housing market packaged and brought to market in the lead-up to the GFC. Nonetheless, product innovation has provided asset owners with valuable opportunities to diversify risk and gain access to certain types of investments that match their long-term objectives.  \n\nEven so, investment consultants are often identified as barriers to the diffusion of new products and new investment strategies. In part, this is because they are more often concerned with the process of framing investment strategy and its implementation than with the nature of investment in its own right. Small funds depend on investment consultants for investment decisionmaking, and industry norms and conventions provide a baseline from which clients evaluate the utility of their options. It would be unusual for an adviser to break with standard practice. Medium-sized funds are more attuned to alternatives in that having a modicum of knowledge and understanding of investment strategy allows asset owners to look beyond the standard formula linking investment strategy with investment products. As such, medium-sized funds have often given investment consultants an audience for innovation. This has been especially effective in circumstances where funds have intensified their relationships with investment consultants.  \n\nThe ambiguity at the heart of the relationship between asset owners and investment consultants has also come under scrutiny, especially from large asset owners. As such, for large asset owners, the issue of innovation has evolved from one dominated by assessing investment options against investment objectives, to one dominated by taking control of the investment process, improving knowledge of market dynamics, and reaching beyond the norms and conventions of the industry to concepts and tools that promote performance. In these circumstances, investment consultants have been asked to add value by bringing to the table innovative ideas and strategies. In such cases, the value of any contract for consulting services is to be had in the skills and expertise of advisers. Here, then, the onus is on the consultant to demonstrate value.  \n\n# IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS  \n\nThis chapter began with the observation that intermediation is a key characteristic of the global financial services industry; standing between individual savers and investment returns on those savings are organizations that collect, manage, and assign to investment vehicles the assets of large groups of individuals. These organizations take a variety of legal forms, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowments, and family offices. It was also observed that these types of organizations typically use intermediaries to frame investment strategy and its implementation. There are, of course, other intermediaries involved, including actuaries, custodians, legal advisers, accountants, and banks. The framework underpinning this chapter can be applied to a wide variety of intermediaries. Nonetheless, given recent criticism of investment consultants, the substantive focus of this chapter has been on delineating their roles and responsibilities.  \n\nThe nature and scope of financial intermediation in any jurisdiction is determined in part by the legacy of norms and conventions specific to that country or region. Even so, it is entirely plausible to argue that the functional effectiveness of intermediation is the true test of the relevance of history and geography (Merton and Bodie 1995, 2005). To the extent that matching savers with investors is fundamental to modern economic systems, it does not matter how it is done as long as it is done in an effective manner. Likewise, it is arguable that it does not matter whether or not a financial organization depends on related but external service providers, so long as its long-term financial performance meets the requirements of its beneficiaries (Dixon 2012). If so, one might expect to see various models of management in the financial services industry, particularly in the relationships between asset owners and investment consultants. There is some variety in management models. There are also remarkable commonalities in those models across jurisdictions and types of organizations, but variable between financial institutions, depending on size.  \n\nAt the heart of our analysis is the assumption that the relationship between asset owners and investment consultants is under-determined. We might have expected to see well-defined contracts governing the relationships between clients and consultants, with clear descriptions of their respective roles and responsibilities. We find, in fact, that these types of contracts are openended, ambiguous about the nature and scope of services to be provided, and virtually silent on issues such as performance. These contracts masquerade as discrete bilateral agreements where, in fact, both parties use them as relational frameworks that have no effective termination date. Ambiguity often suits both parties. For small and medium-sized financial institutions that rely on investment consultants to frame and implement their investment strategies, ambiguity about their roles and responsibilities provides clients with flexibility in the face of changing market conditions. For investment consultants concerned to maintain market share, ambiguity about what counts as ‘performance' enables them to focus on the process of decision-making rather than its substance.  \n\nIndustry norms and conventions set what investment consultants do. At the same time, contracts for services are normally quite explicit about what they do not do and the potential liabilities they and their companies are unwilling to assume. In many jurisdictions, industry norms and conventions reflect the evolution of the global financial services industry, the nature and scope of services, and the segmentation of the industry by size of client. As is often observed, norms and conventions summarize the state of play at any point in time rather than setting goals for the future. Merton and Bodie (2005) supposed that financial institutions inevitably converge on organizational forms that have the virtue of functional efficacy. Here, we have identified the reasons why relationships between clients and consultants remain locked in the past. Models of best practice seek to shift norms and conventions towards higher standards of functional efficacy than those evident in customary practice (Clark and Urwin 2008a, 2010).  \n\nWe explained why norms and conventions have become embedded and entrenched in the industry. It is also suggested that medium-sized asset owners have had opportunities to reframe their relationships with consultants, in part by building up their own internal capabilities and resources, and in part by seeking new ways of adapting to market turmoil. It was observed that size allows clients to discount reliance in favour of more equitable relationships that allow investment consultants to provide knowledge and insights that go beyond what is available to these organizations internally. This argument suggests, however, that the implementation of principles of best practice and the search for innovative ways of investing over the long term depend on the client rather than the consultant. As such, we would shift the focus of attention from investment consultants to clients and ask whether, in fact, the segmentation of the industry into small, medium, and large asset owners is consistent with a collective interest in promoting innovation and excellence in long-term investing (as the Kay Review (Kay 2012) intimated).  \n\nBy this account of innovation, many financial organizations respond to rather than anticipate the market. This matches commentary in the academic literature to the effect that ‘very few organizations have well-established and specialized expertise in the area of management innovation' (Birkinshaw et al. 2008: 830). However, this fails to capture the momentum among large financial institutions (such as pension and sovereign wealth funds) towards insourcing over outsourcing, towards reintermediation through exerting greater control over external providers, and towards redefining their relationships with advisers and consultants—-including insourcing legal services, especially where asset class- and project-specific specialist knowledge is required. Innovation, under these circumstances, can be thought of as endogenous rather than exogenous. It is driven by the capacity to invest in resources as well as the realization that scale brings with it the opportunity to solve conflicts of interest when dealing with consultants who also advise other organizations that could be construed as direct competitors for market opportunities (as in large asset management companies).  \n\nIt was noted that the ambiguity inherent in the relationships between clients and consultants, which is characteristic of the industry, may be to the advantage of both parties. Just as large financial institutions seek consultants to fulfil specific roles and responsibilities rather than provide the range of services typical of the industry, investment consultants have sought to deepen their skills and expertise in areas that few institutions are able to cover given the current state of play in the market. By this account, investment consultants have also sought to innovate to provide capabilities and resources that complement large clients, rather than pretend that they are a substitute for clients capabilities and resources. As the processes of disintermediation and reintermediation gather momentum across the industry, we could well see the emergence of more specialized boutique investment consultants, especially at the higher end of the value proposition.  \n\n# NOTES  \n\n1. Investment consultants are people, normally employees of organizations, who sell services. Globally, the firms Mercer and Willis Towers Watson dominate the investment advisory business. Their significance varies, however, by jurisdiction and market segment. For example, Cambridge Associates is important in North America, the United Kingdom, and Europe for charities, foundations, and family offices. In some countries, public-sector pension funds have steered business away from the major investment consultants to smaller companies.   \n2. Investors need more than a certain quantity of information; to be effective, they also need information distinguished by quality and value. Caplin and Martin (2011: 2899) show that people typically satisfice rather than optimize when searching for information. Consequently, decisions are made without full examination of all the available options, implying that the best available options may be missed. In response, investors may outsource this function to those with the requisite expertise and judgement.   \n3. Organizational flexibility may be desirable given the nature of financial markets, which are always evolving in ways that are neither entirely predictable nor necessarily consistent with inherited management practices and commitments (Lo 2012). Regime shifts are rarely immediately obvious but demand an adaptive capacity that can bridge short-term responsiveness with long-term adaptation. Few financial organizations, however, are as adaptive as Lo's characterization of them implies.   \n4. Choi et al. (2013: 1-50) explain the prevalence of standard contracts in commercial relationships, noting that law firms produce and clients consume contracts not so much for their substantive content as for their form. If there are differences between contracts for the same type of service, these differences tend to be marginal, trading on the ^acceptability’ of standard contracts. They also observe that, given the risk that the courts might interpret their terms in unpredictable ways, it is difficult for law firms to capture ‘returns from contract innovation'.   \n5. It is standard practice in commercial relationships for contractual provisions to limit or exclude damages for failing to live up to the terms of an agreed contract (Gillette 2013) If commercial relationshins are onooino and involve some measure  \n\nof commitment, then these contracts may involve risk sharing and cost sharingthat is, an equitable distribution of the upside and downside of a relationship. This is rare in the global financial services industry.  \n\n6. The dependence and/or reliance of funds on investment consultants, combined with the transaction costs associated with the termination of services, are such that small and medium-sized funds are often locked into these relationships. Investment consultants could exploit their clients by virtue of their privileged positions (K?szegi 2014). Mediating this possibility is the importance attributed by both sides of the market to the reputation of consultants, whether personal or corporate.  \n\n7. See also Hart and Moore (1990: 1122), who suggest that where ^it is costly for agents to write detailed long-term contracts that precisely specify current and future actions as a function of every possible eventuality...the contracts written are incomplete and will be subject to renegotiation later on'. The implication here is that since firms are unable to write ^complete’ contracts with providers, these activities are held within the firm. By contrast, in the financial services industry, ambiguity is underwritten by norms and conventions.  \n\n8. It is also plausible that ambiguity facilitates the development of trust between parties to contracts in that the resolution of ambiguity on an issue-by-issue basis builds confidence in one another's commitment to the overarching project. By this account, trust thrives in these situations because neither party desires the alternative (a complete contract). See Kimel (2005) on the relationship between trust andcontract.  \n\n9  \n\n### Outsourcing and the Principal-Agent Problem  \n\nAs we have seen, there are various ways of managing the investment process, including insourcing the investment of pension-fund assets. Rather than managing providers through service contracts, set in accordance with industry norms and conventions, insourcing utilizes employment contracts with terms and conditions that reflect the goals and objectives of the organization and the market premium available to those who have scarce skills and expertise. There may, in fact, be a discount applied to any premium if pension funds offer employment contracts with terms and conditions that favour collective over individual interests (Chapter 5). Disintermediation and reintermediation are favoured strategies when a fund is of a certain size in assets under management (AUM) with concomitant capabilities and resources (Chapter 6). Size can also give these types of organizations sufficient leverage to rewrite the terms and conditions of service and employment contracts (Chapter 7).  \n\nAnother model of pension-fund governance and management has recently claimed attention: variously labelled, this model of management involves outsourcing the framing and implementation of investment strategy to another entity. The outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO) model of pension-fund management locates the authority and responsibility for investment strategy, along with the option to insource or outsource its implementation, with an external agent. In this chapter, we explain how and why the OCIO model has emerged in the global institutional investment industry. In doing so, we observe that it is an organizational innovation driven, in part, by factors external to the conventional hub-and-spokes model of pension-fund governance and management. We situate this model in relation to other possible models, suggesting that it has certain advantages for smaller pension funds that do not have the options available to larger funds.  \n\nIn some jurisdictions, the OCIO model is called the delegated chief information officer (DCIO) model, whereas in other jurisdictions it is identified as fiduciary management (FM). Whatever the label, it is a mode of management defined by its functions (Merton and Bodie 2005). Van Nunen (2008: xi, 1-2)  \n\nindicated that these types of managers take responsibility for ^comprehensive risk management, strategic decision-making, and effective organizational governance′ while ‘overseeing a decentralised, outsourced array of investment managers'. His analysis did not distinguish between the type of pension institution, the nature of pension benefits, or its jurisdictional particularities. In some jurisdictions, OCIO management could involve the transfer of legally enforceable obligations like the duty to act solely in the interests of pensionplan participants. This is possible, but it is not the object of this chapter. Rather, whatever the virtues of the OCIO model of management, it is shown that there are important governance issues to be resolved. We show, in fact, that there is an important role for investment consultants and similar types of organization.  \n\nWe begin this chapter by relating the conventional model of pension-fund governance and management to the theory and practice of investment. Here again we suggest that the search for alternatives is due, in part, to the costs and consequences of the market turmoil leading up to and immediately following the global financial crisis (GFC). We identify the OCIO model as one of a set of related models of management, so explain its significance against the alternatives. This provides a reference point for nine principles of best-practice OCIO management (along the lines suggested by Clark and Urwin (2008a). One key finding from our research is that, notwithstanding the virtues of OCIO management, it requires governance. Using the principal-agent model, we explore this issue in the penultimate section of the chapter, The PrincipalAgent Problem'. Here, though, the principal-agent model is reconceived through the interaction between information and skill, as well as expertise demonstrating the crucial role that advisers and consultants can play in realizing the benefits of OCIO management. In conclusion, we draw implications for the nature and scope of pension-fund management.  \n\nFollowing our previous discussion, we utilize an analytical framework embedded in theories of the firm. It brings to light principles and practices by eschewing detailed knowledge of the industry and its organizations in favour of the building blocks needed to understand recent developments in the institutional investment industry. More specifically, the approach taken in the chapter brings together many of the lessons drawn from our collaboration with Roger Urwin on the relationship between governance and the management of investment risk and return, and the ways in which institutional investors have responded to the GFC and its aftermath.  \n\n# CONVENTION AND FINANCIAL MARKETS  \n\nBy focusing on the hub-and-spokes model we begin with a recognized organizational type and use it as a benchmark to explain how and why a rather different organizational form has gained traction in the industry. In doing so, it should be acknowledged that, as in any industry, there is considerable organizational diversity, notwithstanding the apparent dominance of one or two organizational types (Hannan and Freeman 1989). Our argument goes further to suggest that the status of one model versus another is owed, in part, to its efficacy in dealing with or adapting to changing circumstances. We follow organizational theorists who argue that any model of management can become so entrenched in convention that it becomes an impediment to change (see Chapter 8 and Gans 2016).  \n\n### Board Authority and Governance  \n\nPension funds and pension-fund boards are similar to corporations in that they are entitled, at their discretion, to own property and a wide variety of financial instruments. Pension-fund boards use those property rights to frame and implement investment strategy. In many jurisdictions, pension-fund board members are expected to have relevant skills and expertise and are subject to similar legal rules and standards of behaviour applicable to corporate board members.  \n\nThere are three important differences between corporations and most pension funds. First, in many jurisdictions, pension funds have a well-defined and single purpose-—to manage and invest pension contributions on behalf of their members in the interests of their long-term financial well-being. Second, although a pension fund's tasks and functions are less pliable than those of a corporation, in that it has a specific purpose, the organizational shape of a fund can change, for example, from insourcing to outsourcing. Finally, whereas a corporation can switch its assets between chosen activities, pension funds typically do not ^own' members? assets. Rather, pension funds act on behalf of members who either have a legal right to those assets should they wish to switch providers, or have legal rights to retirement benefits or a derived income sometime in the future.  \n\nThe hub-and-spokes model of investment management and governance is a bridge between the flexibility of a corporation and the fixed purpose of a pension fund.1 In this model of management, the board and its executive team, as the members’ representatives, use their authority to frame and implement investment strategy to ensure that members’ interests are protected and commitments honoured. When funds place members? assets with investment providers, they do so to take advantage of the scope of the market for financial services and the flexibility of providers in adapting to changes in financial markets. By holding multiple service contracts according to asset class and investment style, it is presumed that there is a premium to be had in switching assets between providers according to their relative performance.  \n\n### Investment Models and Expectations  \n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, accompanying the growth in pension-fund assets in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were a deregulation of financial markets and a liberalization of rules on investment by and across asset classes. Underpinning these developments was the reconceptualization of the theory and practice of investment led by Markowitz (1952a) modern portfolio theory (MPT). In essence, MPT shifts the focus from the risks associated with a specific investment to evaluating investment risk in accordance with asset-specific portfolios. One implication of MPT is that asset classes are more important than individual investments. A second is that, insofar as asset classes vary by risk and return, the framing of a fund's investment strategy depends on its overall risk and return objectives (Campbell and Viceira 2002).  \n\nAs the theory and practice of investment developed, MPT was joined by a programme of research that assumed that financial markets were ipso facto efficient (Fama 1970, 1991). In combination, these developments provided a recipe for investment management (Ho and Lee 2004). Instead of detailed knowledge of specific investments, the touchstone for realizing value was found in the design of optimal portfolios and efficient frontiers (Litterman et al. 2004). Likewise, instead of knowing a market and/or having at hand a list of key informants, investment practice shifted towards identifying product providers who had the insight and information that processing technology needed to outperform their competitors (Shleifer 1985). Since outperformance is unlikely to persist, investment management became preoccupied with the timely switching of mandates between competing providers by asset class. As we have seen indicated in the previous section, ‘Board Authority and Governance', with the expertise required to design an investment strategy and to switch between providers, investment consultants became integral to the investment management process.  \n\n### Market Position and Performance  \n\nPension-fund governance and management came to maturity in a rather benign environment: notwithstanding a handful of noteworthy events, such as the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and the long-term capital management (LTCM) debacle of 1999, year-to-year stock market performance in London and New York was systematically positive over the 1985-2001 period. The conventional model of pension-fund governance and the MPT recipe were handsomely rewarded. Furthermore, investing at home was rewarded, which reinforced investor belief in the virtues of Western financial markets and light-touch government regulation (Barth et al. 2012). Indeed, as the developed financial markets absorbed each event, confidence in the integrity of the received theory and practice of investment management grew (Shiller 2005). A predisposition in favour of the status quo and a widespread belief in the power of mean reversion concealed the long-term costs and consequences of conventional ways of doing business for pension-fund management.  \n\nLost in the obsession of investors and the public alike with the upward trajectory of developed financial markets were the increasing costs associated with the secular decline in discount rates. See Chapter 4 where we illustrate this point in Figure 4.1. As assumptions were slowly revised, renewed pressure was brought to bear on active stock market investment strategies. At the same time, burgeoning growth in the financial markets of developing economies garnered increasing attention led, in part, by asset managers such as Goldman Sachs (Clark 2014). Realizing the potential of these markets prompted greater reliance by the average pension fund on large investment managers with global reach. The search for higher levels of performance in domestic markets also encouraged pension funds to use opportunities that promised higher returns for minimal risk.  \n\nThe GFC in the core markets of the global economy undercut, first, longterm global economic growth; second, the stability of major currencies including the euro; and, third, the growth prospects of emerging economies. These events prompted policymakers to observe that systemic risk is embedded in the global economy's most developed financial markets (Haldane 2009). The implication drawn is that financial markets are irrational in the sense that agent behaviour is separately and collectively self-correcting absent regulation (Haldane and May 2011). More generally, there has been a shift in conceptualizing investment decision-making from the axioms underpinning rational expectations to the behavioural paradigm championed, among many others, by Shleifer (2000), Kahneman (2011), and Lo (2012).  \n\n# MODELS OF MANAGEMENT  \n\nBy convention, pension funds decide whether to hold internally the tasks and functions necessary to realize a target risk-adjusted rate of return (insource) or go to the market for those tasks and functions (outsource). Where there is a high degree of complementarity between tasks and functions, the orchestration of the production process is fundamental to realizing an organization's risk and return objectives. The management issue is whether the costs of segmenting tasks and functions and having external agents provide them outweigh the benefits of managing each element separately. Here, we restate the key assumptions underpinning our analysis, which are important for whatfollows.  \n\n### Economies of Scale and Scope  \n\nAs suggested, the global financial services industry relies upon economies of scale to deliver value for money. Economies of scale have two dimensions. First, there are the upfront costs involved in establishing the management systems and information infrastructure necessary to allocate the inflows and outflows of financial assets. Maintaining the integrity and efficacy of such systems requires continual upgrading and investment. Spreading the costs of these systems is an essential ingredient in minimizing the unit costs of investment management. Second, the asset management process is labour intensive, requiring high levels of domain-specific skills and expertise. Set-up costs are significant and, once established, portfolio teams can absorb large volumes of assets and thereby pay a premium for the most talented professionals (Clark 2015). There are also diseconomies of scale reflected, for example, in the challenges that large asset managers and owners face when seeking to upgrade their information systems.  \n\nEconomies of scope are also important, but more nuanced in effect. Large asset managers often proclaim the virtue of having available a wide variety of investment services (Clark 2002). However, going to market for each task and function can incur significant transaction costs, including the time taken to search and assess competing service providers (Caplin and Martin 2011). Furthermore, given the importance of orchestrating complementary tasks and functions for the production of risk-adjusted returns, segmentation of the investment process can impose significant costs on an otherwise well-conceived investment strategy. Notwithstanding the supposed virtues of separate contracts for service providers, pension funds can find it difficult to orchestrate in a timely fashion the implementation and management of investment.2  \n\n### Outsourcing Strategy  \n\nWhereas theories of the firm focus on sourcing tasks and functions, few studies have considered the issue of insourcing or outsourcing the firm's central decision-making unit. Nonetheless, there are many instances of ownerentrepreneurs relinquishing direct control of their firms and delegating control to a chosen chief executive officer (CEO) and executive team. This is evident, for example, when a firm is passed from one generation to another and/or when its growing size and complexity is such that a small group of executives is unable to give effect to planned goals and objectives. It is problematic to suppose that CEOs and their teams would give up their authority and responsibility to set firm strategy. If they were to do so, this would threaten the raison d'etre of their existence and salaries. This happens, though, when a company agrees to be acquired by another, resulting either in redundancy or, in the case of the acquiring company not merging the operations of the target company, the maintenance of a shallow administrative staff.  \n\nNonetheless, the outsourcing of corporate competitive strategy is more common than theorists suppose. Consulting companies exist, in part, to provide advice on corporate strategy. These consultants frame the issues and options, while management consultants take the chosen strategy and develop the means by which the client implements it. Strategy consultants have prospered for a variety of reasons (McAfee 2002). Facing external threats, incumbent boards may feel insufficiently informed or unable to rely on their senior staff to frame a strategy that sets aside past commitments in favour of a different future. Facing internal divisions, incumbent boards rely on (trust) strategy consultants to help resolve internal competing interests that would otherwise paralyse decisionmaking (Gluickler and Armbrüster 2003). Outsourcing the framing and implementation of strategy is an important way of adapting to a changing world.  \n\n### Four Ideal Types  \n\nIn what follows, we assume that the options that the sponsor of a pension fund faces in responding to the apparent shortcomings of the conventional model of pension-fund governance and management have two dimensions. For a larger fund with a volume of financial assets consistent with insourcing the production of investment returns, the implementation of a chosen investment strategy can be via insourcing or outsourcing or a combination of both. Smaller funds might also consider insourcing some tasks and functions, while recognizing that there will be tasks and functions for which the volume of assets is insufficient to provide those activities internally in a cost-efficient manner. Then there are small funds where insourcing is simply not possible.  \n\nThese cases, and others, are represented in Figure 9.1. Model A is the larger fund referenced in the previous subsection, Outsourcing Strategy'. It combines a well-resourced governance function (framing investment strategy) with insourcing the tasks and functions (services) needed to realize that strategy. Model C is the conventional hub-and-spokes model in which the board, its subcommittees, and advisers frame the investment strategy but outsource its implementation. Model B is less common in that the governance function is outsourced but implementation is insourced. This model has been observed in financial service companies and in some global corporations where the governance function is expected to be independent of the sponsor, its board, and senior executives. In effect, this model of management presupposes that there can be significant conflicts of interest when senior executives dominate the governance of its ^captive' pension fund. At the same time, insourcing implementation can be cost-efficient, reinforced by an alignment of interests otherwise not possible when service provision is outsourced.  \n\n![](images/156a993eb9299aef2a171aad14c5967141a08934ac964c89b739c5084fb1c39f.jpg)  \nFigure 9.1. Models of governance Source: Authors  \n\nIn Model D, the governance function is outsourced along with the implementation of the chosen investment strategy. Depending on the jurisdiction, the entity responsible for framing and implementing investment strategy is, quite literally, the fiduciary being subject to common law and statute-based standards of behaviour that are consistent with fiduciary duty. In some jurisdictions, however, both the client and the OCIO manager are subject to fiduciary duty in that the client is required to oversee the OCIO manager in a manner consistent with trust law. Notice that a space or set of activities may not be entirely consistent with the particularities of each model. That is, there could be an ‘in-between' model at the centre of Figure 9.1. For example, a Model A organization could outsource some activities, just as the Model D organization could insource some.?  \n\nHere, OCIO managers come in various forms. Some stand-alone companies with the skills and expertise needed to frame and implement investment strategy specialize in OCIO management. Some large multifunctional financial service companies provide OCIO management along with a wide range of other banking and investment services. Yet other companies have entered the market for OCIO management from the consulting side of the asset management industry, thereby deploying skills and expertise normally offered to Model A and Model C types of pension funds. In many cases, specialist OCIO management companies and asset consulting companies rely on the market for financial services when implementing investment strategy. By contrast, large financial companies expect to provide needed investment management services, albeit subject to market standards of performance and value for money.  \n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each type of OCIO manager. Specialist OCIO management companies may excel at framing investment strategy, yet face significant transaction costs when searching for, evaluating. and managing the service providers needed to implement the strategy. In this respect, they may rely on asset consultants to cut through the maze of market claims and counterclaims. Asset consultants are skilled at framing investment strategy and have at their fingertips extensive knowledge of the market for financial services. Indeed, this may be their comparative advantage. However, when it comes to orchestrating the investment process, the costs of managing external providers can constrain their capacity to do so.  \n\n# PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES  \n\nThe principles and practices for best-practice pension-fund governance are well established (Clark and Urwin 2008a). They are arranged hierarchically so that sponsors and funds can assess their standing, the value to be had from the implementation of each principle, and the standards appropriate to different sizes of pension funds and similar organizations. It was shown in the previous section, “Models of Management', that governance and risk are intimately connected: the resources devoted to governance provide a reference point from which to judge the degree of risk a pension fund can effectively manage. These principles and practices remain important and, arguably, have gained widespread recognition because of the costs and consequences of market volatility over the past decade or so.  \n\n### Nine Principles  \n\nHere, we summarize and briefly explain the key principles underpinning bestpractice OCIO management. As indicated in this chapter, these are abstract, albeit not abstract enough to be irrelevant.4 They should be understood as necessary conditions for best-practice OCIO management and are rank ordered, moving from fundamental and essential to more complex and sophisticated, even if subject to negotiation over the framing and execution of the contract binding the parties together in the fiduciary relationship.  \n\nPrinciple 1: clarity of mandate. Essential to a well-functioning OCIO management programme is the mandate or goals and objectives of the mandate. Most obviously, this could include investment return, risk, and performance objectives set in relation to the client's broader objectives. For example, the long-term objective of the client could be to ensure solvency of the pension fund in relation to its obligations to participants. A subsidiary goal could be to limit calls for more resources from the client or sponsor over the longer term, thereby facilitating the planning of capital expenditures.  \n\nPrinciple 2: simplicity of performance measures. Translating the mandate into performance measures is an essential ingredient in providing the OCIO manager with an unambiguous focus. It is a truism that organizations manage what is measured (Lowenstein 1996). This is important both for the client and for the OCIO manager. For the client, accepted performance measures provide a means of testing the effectiveness of the provider. For the OCIO manager, such measures can be used to impose discipline on the activities of its own organization. Both elements are fundamental to ensuring a well-functioning relationship.  \n\nPrinciple 3: alignment of interests. OCIO management is notionally a longterm commitment by both the client and the provider. Given objectives and performance measures, the client has an interest in ensuring that the provider shares in both the upside and downside of the investment programme. This is one way of reinforcing the link between framing and implementing the investment strategy, providing the OCIO manager with a strong incentive to integrate the investment process. Integration can, for example, make transparent the link between risk management and long-term investment performance.  \n\nPrinciple 4: enhanced complementarity. One of the costs of the hub-and-spokes model of pension-fund governance is the segmentation of the various tasks and functions that make up the framing and implementation of investment strategy. In principle, one of the most important benefits of OCIO management is the opportunity to reap the benefits of complementarity, having direct control over the investment value chain through the integration of investment strategy and its implementation. This is a key test of the effcacy of any OCIO management relationship.  \n\nPrinciple 5: transparent decision rights. To realize the goals and objectives of a fiduciary mandate, to reap the benefits of greater coordination over complementary activities, and to be able to act within the terms and conditions of the agreement without negotiation are key ingredients of success. Transparency is essential in the decision rights of the OCIO manager in relation to the client, and in the manager over the allocation of responsibilities for the performance of the agreement. Lack of transparency on both counts is likely to discount the benefits of outsourcing the framing and implementation of investment strategy.  \n\nPrinciple 6: delegation with deference. By convention, the investment subcommittee advises the board, which has final authority over investment strategy and its implementation. Investment subcommittees often claim a measure of deference for their recommendations by virtue of their members? skills and expertise (Clark 2007). OCIO management involves formally delegating these matters to an external agent; in these circumstances, delegation requires deference to the agent's judgement. To second-guess an agent would be to discount the value of OCIO management and put in play the contract setting out the terms and conditions of the agreement binding the parties together.  \n\nPrinciple 7: integration with checks and balances. Ultimately, the success of OCIO management depends on integrating services otherwise provided separately in the hub-and-spokes model. While it is customary to ensure that service providers come from different companies, the virtue of OCIO management is the effective coordination of these services within an organization so that one service provider does not hold the others hostage to its interests. However, this may require an overarching ‘manager? whose incentives are consistent with those of the client or clients. In some large multifunctional service companies, this may be difficult to realize.  \n\nPrinciple 8: adaptive capacity and potential. Another test of the efficacy of any OCIO management relationship is the external agent's capacity to adapt to financial market risk and uncertainty. At one level, adaptive capacity can be measured by the responsiveness of the OCIO manager to shifts in market expectations, being both a strategic issue and an issue of orchestrating the investment process. At another level, it reflects one of the key findings of Clark and Urwin (2008a), namely that managers risk budgets should be aligned with their governance budgets.  \n\nPrinciple 9: certainty with flexibility. A key driver in the adoption of the OCIO management model of investment management has been financial market instability and the erosion of confidence in MPT (Lo 2012). At the same time, both parties desire certainty when writing contracts for services—that is, certainty about their rights and privileges. Nonetheless, any contract must also be flexible to allow for discretion in responding to unanticipated circumstances. Inevitably, any contract for services must be able to evolve without incurring significant delays and transaction costs. In this sense, a contract for services can be interpreted as a governance framework for shared goals and objectives.  \n\nIt is apparent that these nine principles are interdependent. For example, the clarity of an OCIO management mandate enables simplicity of performance measurement. Likewise, the alignment of interests depends on principles 1 and 2 (Ambachtsheer 2016). With respect to the second group of principles, delegation with deference allows OCIO managers to enhance the benefits of complementarity. Being able to do so, however, depends on clarity over the decision rights of both parties (Clark 2007). As for the third group of principles, we have emphasized the adaptive capacity of any contract for OCIO management services in relation to market movements. Realizing the benefits of adaptive capacity depends on the nature and flexibility of the contract for services.  \n\n### Practice as Contract  \n\nAs noted, the hub-and-spokes model of investment management is a conventional mode of organization, relying as it does on standardized contracts for investment services. In doing so, this model of management is a form of organization that tends to minimize transaction costs—that is, the costs associated with negotiating contracts for services, writing contracts, and overseeing performance against expectations (Schepker et al. 2014). This model of management is used to dampen opportunism on both sides of the market, holding both parties to account by reference to recognized standards of behaviour. It is commonplace for clients to ask whether a choice made or a decision taken with respect to an agreement for services is consistent with industry practice.  \n\nWhile the hub-and-spokes model uses organizational oversight, deliberation, and decision-making to govern the investment process, OCIO management would replace it with a single or small set of contracts for services. With a well-defined set of goals and objectives, agreed measures of performance, and transparent decision rights, delegation with deference is the means by which the parties to the agreement realize their common objectives. In this sense, contract stands in place of active management, being as it is a blueprint or framework for action by the party charged with the responsibility for framing and implementing investment strategy (Davis 2013). Here, however, is a matter that goes to the heart of the contractual agreement binding the parties together. At issue is whether contracts for services are incomplete in terms of being a full specification of the privileges and responsibilities of both parties (Argyres et al. 2007).  \n\nIf OCIOs manage to claim deference for their decision-making, any contracts for services need to be adaptive and responsive to shifts in market expectations rather than hemmed in by convention; in other words, sufficiently flexible to facilitate the manager's best endeavours. Put slightly differently, insofar as checks and balances exist in the relationship between the parties, to realize the potential inherent in the outsourcing of investment strategy and its implementation, OCIO managers require a degree of certainty about their authority and responsibilities. For some analysts, this is an issue of trust (Connelly et al. 2012). In this context, it refers to the degree to which a client willingly defers to the provider's chosen strategies and actions taken, albeit subject to measures of performance against goals and objectives. Note, however, it would seem that trust is earned rather than assumed from the start of a relationship.  \n\nThree implications follow. First, a pension-fund board may find it difficult in the early stages of its relationship with an OCIO manager to have a degree of trust consistent with the flexibility desired by both parties. As such, the initial contract binding the parties together may contain reporting protocols that mimic conventional investment management agreements (IMAs). Second, as the client becomes more comfortable with the manager and the discretion inherent in the relationship, the contract may evolve to be more flexible and open-ended than a standard IMA (Mayer and Argyres 2004). Third, over time, the contract may recede into the background and be replaced by an ongoing relationship between the parties. In this respect, rather than defining the relationship between the parties, the contract would then become a tool of last resort.  \n\nThese implications presuppose that clients have the capabilities and resources to seek and/or design bespoke agreements with service providers. The logic set out also presupposes that OCIO managers are willing to accept such agreements. In fact, small funds neither have such capabilities and resources, nor are they large enough to justify the investment of managers in such agreements. Under these circumstances, potential clients are most likely to be offered a service contract on a take-it-or-leave-it basis (Deakin and Michie 2000: 1-39). On the other hand, larger funds may well have the requisite capabilities, resources, and AUM to make them desirable clients. Here, OCIO managers seeking market share may be willing to adapt standard IMAs to garner a bigger client base.  \n\nAs contracts for services evolve, new types of agreements consistent with the needs of the parties to OCIO management relationships may then filter down to less well-endowed clients, a process that could accelerate in the face of changing market conditions. In these ways, as Choi et al. (2013) implied, innovation in OCIO management agreements could establish industry-wide protocols that are different from standard IMAs.6  \n\n# THE PRINCIPAL-AGENT PROBLEM  \n\nThe effcacy of OCIO management depends, as in other economic relationships, on the degree to which the sponsor or pension fund (principal) is an effective client and the OCIO manager (agent) is an efficient provider. In economics, the principal-agent problem obtains in any situation where an entity ^delegates an action to an agent (Laffont and Martimort 2002: 4). Given the significance of delegation in modern economies, and the importance of this issue for the effectiveness of OCIO management relationships, in this section we discuss three aspects of the problem, as well as the various mechanisms used to manage if not expunge it. Some types of OCIO management relationships are more vulnerable to the principal-agent problem than others.  \n\n### Identity and Responsibility  \n\nThe principal-agent problem is deeply embedded in the global financial services industry (Ambachtsheer 2016). Consider, for example, the links in the investment chain connecting the pension-fund participant with, in order of importance, the pension fund, the actuary, the asset consultant, the custodian, the asset manager, and the accountant (Black 1992). Each link in the chain is formally constituted through a contract binding the parties together, in which each party has the rights and privileges of a person but is, normally, an organization and not a person per se. The employee representing an organization directs other employees in the fulfilment of the contract and other contracts with similar organizations. Normally, contracts between organizations are mute on intra-organizational matters.  \n\nPension funds that rely on the hub-and-spokes model of investment management often seek to understand how an asset manager, for example, is organized internally to realize a target risk-adjusted rate of return. This is because such organizations are vulnerable to management failures. OCIO management seeks to clarify the respective roles of the principal and agent, where the former is responsible for selecting the OCIO manager and the latter for all matters pertaining to the framing of investment strategy and its implementation. With a clear mandate, simple performance measures, and aligned interests, the client need not intrude on the investment management process and the performance of each element in the process. OCIO management presupposes that the agent bears the costs and consequences of the investment management process.  \n\n### Two Institutional Factors  \n\nPrincipals and agents differ markedly in terms of their organizational longevity or persistence. Pension funds are expected to last as long as their obligations and commitments, with a long-term planning horizon consistent with their participants? retirement plans. In many jurisdictions, pension funds have an organizational form that is protected by law and regulation. By contrast, there is an active market for corporate control in the global financial services industry. Any deal struck between a principal and its OCIO manager must be robust enough to outlast those responsible for negotiating the deal. At the same time, recognizing that both the agent and its employees may come and go over the course of an agreement, pension funds may well seek a contract that provides for termination should such changes impose costs on the principal.  \n\nEqually, it should be recognized that principals and agents are not the only players in these relationships. The hub-and-spokes model of investment management comes with a string of intermediaries, including expert advisers and consultants. Whereas Judge (2013, 2015) disparages consultants because they impose costs on transactions and bring greater complexity to the production of financial services, it is apparent that these agents are often fundamental to framing and realizing goals and objectives (particularly in smaller pension funds and similar institutions). Furthermore, advisers and consultants can provide some continuity in commercial relationships otherwise subject to the flux and flow of the financial services industry. In what follows, we suggest that advisers and consultants can play a key role in providing the expertise necessary for the effective governance of the principal-agent problem.  \n\n### Governing OCIO Management  \n\nIn effect, the relationship between pension funds and their OCIO managers must be governed, even if the relevant issues are different from those of the standard hub-and-spokes model. Economic theorists suppose that the fundamental problem affecting relationships between principals and agents is that information is not evenly distributed between the parties (Meckling and Jensen 1976). Because the agent is responsible for framing and implementing investment strategy, it has access to information that the principal cannot directly observe. As such, it can systematically limit the distribution of relevant information to put the principal at a disadvantage. There are two possible effects of information asymmetry—adverse selection (hidden knowledge) and moral hazard (hidden action') (Laffont and Martimort 2o02).  \n\nThe standard principal-agent model assumes that information is scarce and the costs of searching for and selecting it are significant.7 Assuming all organizations, particularly smaller pension funds, face significant budget constraints, it may be impossible for clients to overcome this disadvantage. However, it is reasonable to suppose that, whatever the premium on information, one of the defining characteristics of the global financial services industry is the volume of information available to third parties, whatever their standing in the investment management process. While we should take care not to confuse quantity with quality, the world envisaged by economic theorists has changed markedly over the past fifty years and will continue to do so with the advent of ‘big data'.  \n\nAccess to information is fundamental to the principal-agent problem (Pratt and Zeckhauser 1985). A second element is the skills and expertise available to the principal in overseeing its relationship with providers.8 A high level of expertise matching that of the agent may empower the client actively to govern its contractual relationship, thereby dampening the costs and consequences of information asymmetry. Conversely, a low level of expertise relative to the agent may mean that the principal does not have the capacity to assess the agent's investment management process. A lack of, or indeed systematic exclusion from, relevant information is likely to accentuate the problems associated with low levels of expertise. In these circumstances, the contractual relationship between the principal and agent is likely to continue until it fails (in dramatic fashion).  \n\n![](images/f99a986c51f5066616b86ca8d1bf7c6ef59f3c9532cfc3c69b8010cf89214daa.jpg)  \nFigure 9.2. Models of management Source:Authors  \n\nIn these ways, the principal-agent problem has two dimensions and a set of possible states. In Figure 9.2, we provide a systematic mapping of the principal-agent problem relevant to governing OCIO management. Going beyond the standard way of representing the principal-agent problem, the issue is framed by reference to information and expertise with four ideal types. Clearly, our map of the principal-agent problem is rather abstract, suggesting the existence of categorically different types where, in fact, there is likely to be a continuum along the two dimensions of the problem. Therefore, for example, where we represent the availability of information as either ubiquitous or scarce, this ignores real-world issues such as the quality of information, including its specificity.  \n\nModel A represents the best possible situation for a principal governing an agent. A high level of expertise combined with information is likely to empower a pension-fund client in relation to its OCIO manager. How is this possible? A client could employ a knowledgeable consultant or set of consultants, and could hire key employees who have worked on both sides of the market. The danger in this situation is that the client comes to dominate the OCIO manager to the detriment of both sides of the relationship.  \n\nModel D, by contrast, is an instance of the OCIO manager capturing the principal, for there is no basis for systematically overseeing its organizational robustness or its short- and long-term performance. Either expert advice is unavailable at a fee the fund can afford, or the provider systematically denies the consultant information on or insight into its strategy and implementation. Model B is entirely possible in that, despite limited information, a high level of expertise can empower a client to be an effective governing party if done on a strategic basis with selective expenditure on needed information. Here, a consultant with experience in this segment of the market could compensate for limited information by referencing information from other sources.9 Model C, by contrast, would seem to be a losing proposition in that, despite a rich source of information, the principal simply does not have, or cannot afford, the expertise to take advantage of the available information in governing its relationship with the OCIO manager.  \n\nIn the world observed, among smaller pension funds there are few Model A cases, many Model Ds, an increasing number of Model Bs, but fewer Model Cs. Pension funds that are conscious of their reliance on their OCIO manager, and sensitive to shifts and changes in the global financial services industry that affect the ownership and organization of service companies, have begun to invest in expertise to discount the risks associated with adverse selection and moral hazard. Note, however, that capture is an ever-present danger. In some cases, appointing an OCIO manager is an opportunity for the plan sponsor or sponsors to discount the costs associated with the governance and administration of their pension funds. This is apparent in circumstances where the corporate or government sponsor requires small pension funds to give up their investment management, governance, and implementation functions to a central agency.  \n\n# IMPLICATIONS ANDCONCLUSIONS  \n\nOCIO management is one response to the costs and consequences of the huband-spokes model of pension-fund governance. At base, it involves outsourcing both the framing and the implementation of investment strategy. In Figure 9.1, other kinds of responses were identified, including retaining responsibility for framing investment strategy and insourcing its implementation. This type of response involves disintermediation and, in some circumstances, strategic reintermediation. Our framework also includes a less familiar case where large financial institutions and corporations outsource the framing of investment strategy but insource its implementation, thereby taking advantage of existing capabilities and resources, including the capacity to monitor closely and oversee the investment process. Given the economies of size and scope that dominate the financial services industry, many smaller pension funds have identified  \n\nOCIO management as a viable alternative to the conventional hub-andspokesmodel.  \n\nWhereas it is suggested that OCIO management is a new phenomenon, there are examples of it in the global pension-fund industry. For example, the large multi-employer pension plans that provide investment services, including the framing and implementation of investment strategy, can be thought of as a form of OCIO management. While participating sponsors and members are normally represented on boards of management, they tend not to be involved in the investment management process. To participate in the schemes may require participating sponsors to give up their rights to monitor and oversee these organizations, delegating this responsibility to their representatives. In the United States, for example, state governments often require lower units of government to participate in these organizations. Once employers join this type of organization, however, they often find it virtually impossible to leave. Nonetheless, despite having relinquished their fiduciary responsibilities to another entity, participating employers frequently retain responsibility for the payment of pension benefits.  \n\nA key finding of our research is that the plan-sponsor-OCIO-manager relationship must be managed. Yet, the nature of this relationship is such that the modes of monitoring and oversight typical of the hub-and-spokes model are not especially relevant. Indeed, close oversight of the OCIO manager could discount the advantages of outsourcing the framing and implementation of investment strategy. We provide a set of nine principles and  practices  that underpin an  effective plan-sponsor-OCIO-manager relationship. These principles and practices were allied with previous research on the principles of best-practice pension-fund governance (Clark and Urwin 2o08a). Clarity of mandate and delegation with deference resonate with our template and considerations of how best to manage the insourcing of investment services. It was also suggested that, in governing the plansponsor-OCIO-manager relationship, a key measure of success is being able to reap the benefits of complementarity and the adaptive capacity of the manager.  \n\nInevitably, a contract formalizes any such relationship. It was noted, however, that smaller pension funds contemplating a relationship with an OCIO manager face the prospect of being offered a standard contract on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. This is not to say that standard contracts are without virtue: they are widely accepted in the industry because of the high costs of negotiating bespoke agreements (see Chapter 8). In some cases, OCIO managers offer standard contracts modelled on industry-accepted IMAs. Larger clients can, of course, claim special treatment because of their significance to providers. Both sides of the relationship may find virtue in a standard contract, particularly in the early phases of a relationship in which trust is yet to be established. In any event, clients may wish to hold in reserve the powers afforded to them by a standard contract, particularly with regard to termination, given the flux and flow of the global financial services market.  \n\nThis is the realm of the principal-agent problem. The apparent asymmetries in the relationships between many plan sponsors and their OCIO managers are such that the former may well bear the costs of adverse selection and moral hazard. On this issue, we provide an analytical framework that links together the expertise of the client with its access to information. Analytically, the normal way of representing the principal-agent problem is to assume that the agent holds all relevant information, which it discloses to the principal to advantage its position. Rarely do these models consider the issue of expertise and how that may either amplify or dampen the principal-agent problem. Financial markets are so awash with information that an expert client can reasonably assess an OCIO manager's investment strategy if not the choice of the various options related to its implementation. It is shown that a wellinformed expert client can be an effective partner in a plan-sponsor-OCIOmanager relationship. A naive client with inadequate information could well be held hostage by a service provider.  \n\nIn any event, concern for these issues may well give rise to further segmentation in the market for financial services. There are three different kinds of OCIO managers. These are (i) single-purpose entities established to provide the service, (i) asset consultants and similar types of organizations that provide OCIO management to established clients and others, and (i) large asset management companies that provide the service alongside a broad array of complementary services. Each type of entity could attract its own loyal client base. For example, a plan sponsor and/or pension fund that invests in its own expertise and information to govern its relationship with the OCIO manager could effectively seek out a single purpose entity or an asset consultant willing to cultivate a relationship with such a client. By contrast, if the plan sponsor and/or pension fund simply wants to pass on responsibility for framing and implementing investment strategy, this type of client may well seek out a large asset manager.  \n\n# NOTES  \n\n1. The demand for flexibility in the purchase and provision of financial services within and between relevant tasks and functions is one reason why intermediation is so important in the global financial services industry. Other accounts of intermediation in the industry emphasize the existence of information asymmetries (Allen 1990; Allen and Santamero 1998).   \n2. In this regard, our argument resonates with Holmstrom and Milgrom's (1991) observation that many economic activities carry with them multiple tasks, and many tasks carry multiple dimensions. In essence, realizing value in investment  \n\nmanagement is to be found in the effective coordination of the various tasks that go into framing and implementing investment strategy being mindful of the complexity of each task.  \n\n3. Large, multifunctional organizations can find it difficult to remain at the leading edge of innovation in any sector or industry. As such, outsourcing can provide an action space for the senior executives of large financial institutions (asset owners and asset managers) seeking to adapt to, or keep abreast of, new ideas and tactics in the industry. If successful, outsourcing can become insourcing as new initiatives are integrated into the business of the financial institution (Bachher and Monk 2013).  \n\n4. Inevitably, given the heritage of an institution and its ongoing commitments, there are limits to the implementation of best practice (Gertler 2003; Granovetter 1985). In addition, the legal environment in which a financial institution operates can structure contractual arrangements, thereby excluding options otherwise judged desirable (La Porta et al. 1998). The latter issue could affect the relevance of principles 7-9.  \n\n5. While specificity is a virtue, clients may also seek performance measures that allow for comparison across providers of OCIO management services. Inevitably, a wellfunctioning market for financial services thrives when comparability is one element of the process of assessing competing providers. Third-party data providers have transformed the global financial services industry.  \n\n6. Implied is a mode of innovation in legal form and function that follows the needs of the market rather than being conceived by forward-looking legislators or the courts. Gilson et al. (2013) argue that early on in the formation of a new mode of contract, courts can impede rather than facilitate progress. This logic is consistent with the role of industry associations in facilitating the development of industry norms and conventions.  \n\n7. The costs and social consequences of the asymmetrical distribution of information have a long history in economics and the social sciences. See Akerlof (1970) for his seminal treatment of the issue, using a simple example to illustrate how a buyer can be at a disadvantage relative to a seller when assessing the quality of a product. Spence (1977) took the issue further, providing a systematic way of integrating the distribution of information with market phenomena.  \n\n8. For Glode et al. (2012: 1724), expertise is required to process information about the values of assets traded'. They go on to suggest that financial expertise...is the ability to acquire more accurate information'. Thereafter, they observed that complex financial products require a level of expertise that is not readily available in the market, thereby driving compensation and the like. See Clark (2016) on the nature of the distribution of financial expertise in time and space among different types of investors.  \n\n9. Standard treatments of the principal-agent problem make little allowance for the systematic leakage’ of information from agents to principals through repeated engagement and observation of the behaviour of other similarly placed parties. It is widely observed that information cascades through the financial services industry, reinforced by the actions of agents competing with other providers to garner market share. It has also been shown that the interaction between agents, between agents and principals, and between principals promotes the disclosure of information, which, in a settled market, would otherwise be more ^sticky’ than observed. See Caplin and Leahy (1994) on the release of information to the market.  \n\n### 10  \n\n### Cooperation and Collaboration  \n\nThroughout the book, we have focused on institutional form and functions, the ways in which financial institutions organize themselves and their service providers, and how they have sought to take advantage of opportunities in global markets. Motivating our research has been an interest in rewriting theories of the firm that focus on commodity-producing companies, favouring financial institutions that depend on intangible assets to produce returns in global markets that are subject to risk and uncertainty. Responding to financial instability is not simple: it requires organizational flexibility, management authority, and mandates, as well as formal and not-so-formal mechanisms for facilitating innovation. In this chapter, we explain how and why new modes of cooperation and collaboration between rather than within institutions have become important. These options offer senior managers an intermediate action space between their institutions and financial markets to transcend home bias.  \n\nIn the next section, ‘Returning to Fundamentals', we remind the reader about what is distinctive about the global financial services industry. It is noted that there are significant economies of scale and scope in money management, providing a rationale for the in-house provision of financial services. In benign financial conditions, an institution's strategic asset allocation and investment management decisions tend to frame the issue of make-or-buy (being an issue of cost effectiveness and control). However, as financial markets have become hostile environments, in which even the largest institutions find it a challenge to be effective, there is an increasing premium on organizational capacity, whether internal or external to the institution. Cooperation and collaboration give senior managers opportunities to adapt or extend the capacities of their institutions to respond to a changing environment (Helfat et al. 2007: 1-2). In the penultimate section of this chapter, Transforming Home Bias', we apply our characterization of cooperation and collaboration to the design of investment platforms that bring together financial institutions across space and time to invest in opportunities that are beyond inherited capabilities and resources.  \n\nThis chapter provides findings that are relevant to the literature on organizational change and to concerted efforts to understand better the nature and shape of global financial services. It shows that financial institutions often seek partners for cooperation and collaboration outside their home jurisdiction, but recognize that knowing too much about local institutions that may be competitors for talent and market share can create conflicts of interest. We note that institutions seek partners from jurisdictions that are, within limits, different, which allows them to adopt lessons learned without necessitating radical changes in institutional form. Importantly, we also show that institutions seek partners that are, in a sense, symmetrical. For example, being large in terms of assets under management (AUM) relative to other partners enables an institution to assume a significant share of the costs of cooperation and collaboration. Finally, we identify the likely limits associated with cooperation and collaboration, especially with respect to the capacity of senior managers to make commitments on behalf of their organizations.  \n\n# RETURNING TO FUNDAMENTALS  \n\nWe return to earlier chapters of the book to re-emphasize key characteristics of the financial services and institutional investment sectors that are important for understanding the logic of organizational change in institutional investors. In doing so, we seek to marry theory and practice with due regard to the world in which institutions frame strategy and facilitate decision-making. At the same time, we refer to the organizing principles underpinning the production of investment returns, while being sensitive to space and time.  \n\n# Persistence and Competition  \n\nAt the heart of recent treatments of organizational behaviour and strategic management is a concern with the goodness of fit between the organization and the market in which it must operate (Barnett 2008). While the competitive circumstances of markets vary over space and time, market competition is believed to be a fundamental mechanism with which to reward and penalize companies for their adaptability to changing circumstances. This logic provides a rationale for predatory behaviour and the elimination of rivals through mergers and acquisitions. While there are other explanations for mergers and acquisitions (see Coffee et al. 1988), it is assumed that competition between firms in relation to market share is a key mechanism by which rent-seeking behaviour is contained and disciplined (Jensen 1993).  \n\nBy contrast, many asset owners have exclusive control over the accumulation, management, and investment of funds. Because of their relationships with fund sponsors and beneficiaries, pension funds and sovereign funds rarely if ever face rivals for control of the flow of funds. In fact, ^capture′ on both sides of the relationship between sponsor and institution is an ever-likely possibility. On the other side of the equation, however, it is apparent that while pension and sovereign funds are not in competition with other similar institutions for their asset base, they do compete with one another for risk-adjusted rates of return on financial assets. If this premium is randomly distributed in time above and below industry benchmarks, customary practice is the ruling ethic of management in the sector. Systematic underperformance can lead to significant shifts in strategy, changes to in-house and external service provision, and investment in institutions' capabilities and resources.  \n\nAt the limit, where systematic underperformance relative to peers threatens the viability of institutions’ sponsors, poor performance can precipitate the dissembling or restructuring of the institutions inherited form and functions.1 Given the importance of benchmarks and the imputed career risks, there is a premium on learning from other institutions, especially those better able to produce a return premium on investments located at some distance from their home domain (as suggested in Chapter 3).  \n\n### Economies of Scale and Scope  \n\nTextbook treatments of the competitive strategies of firms often begin with the size of the firm relative to its market, and the advantages that accrue to large firms by virtue of scale. That is, relatively low average per unit costs of production and, on the margin, lower per unit costs of production as the volume of production expands. Theorists recognize that, at some point, the unit costs of production begin to increase in the face of increasing complexity, problems of coordination, and inertia (Coase 1937; Williamson 1975). Economies of scope are also important; size allows firms to produce more specialized tasks and functions, discounting the cost of overheads attributed to the core activities of the firm. This is one reason why firms extend the range of products and services offered as they grow in size (measured in terms of, inter alia, the volume of production). Facilitating complementarities can also reduce the appeal of the market for existing consumers, while attracting new consumers interested in a range of options within one commercial relationship (Clark 2002).  \n\nEconomies of scale and scope are significant in the investment sector. Funds unwilling or unable to incur the costs of being small in AUM terms, outsource the supply of financial services and products. Because the senior executives of such funds spend most of their time on investment strategy, they recruit the help of investment consultants and actuaries to monitor the performance of external investment managers. As AUM grow in volume, funds tend to provide and oversee the relatively inexpensive tasks and functions in terms of skill and expertise in-house. As suggested in Chapters 4 and 5, this can include, for example, investment in certain asset classes such as bonds and equities, where a high level of skill and expertise is less important than the cost advantages of placing them in generic or easily imitated financial products. Large funds can provide most of the tasks and functions needed to manage assets and liabilities internally. Realizing the advantages of complementarity, however, demands organizational skill and management authority—factors that may be in scarce supply among both large and small institutional investors.2  \n\n### Contingency and Response  \n\nStandard treatments of commodity production suggest that learning by doing is an important element in promoting labour productivity and, ultimately, firm-specific competitiveness within and among industries. However, financial theorists doubt whether these conditions are obtained in financial markets over the long term (Weitzman 2007). To the extent that market expectations are realized, these are moments of stability disrupted by unexpected events that discount the value of past practices, while raising doubts about their applicability in the future. In Chapter 8, we have drawn the attention of the reader to the path of the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 index over the period 1984 to 2016. We identified a number of seemingly ^selfcontained’ market episodes or phases. Over the period 1984 to 1997, the FTSE moved steadily upwards with remarkably low volatility. Thereafter, momentum accelerated, then became subject to booms and busts, and most recently brought the global economy to the brink of collapse. In the first phase, holding equities for the long term was rewarded; in the second phase, long termism was not rewarded. Sophisticated time-variant investment strategies were required simply to hold risk and uncertainty at bay.  \n\nThere are various ways of coping with these conditions. Rather than produce planned risk-adjusted rates of return within an institution, senior executives may outsource asset-management functions. In doing so, they would hope to contain the possible losses associated with changing market conditions by switching mandates among providers in a timely manner based on market performance. Here, there is a premium on institutional decision-making capacity. Alternatively, senior managers can benchmark internal providers against the leading edge found in the industry, varying the allocation of assets between internal and external providers to maintain options should (when) markets change in unexpected ways. Yet another option is to leave the market altogether and establish internal investment offices that rely less on financial markets and more on private placement of investments in untraded opportunities such as infrastructure and private equity. These options are three among many, all of which depend on the authority of senior managers relative to internal and external portfolio managers (see Chapter 9, for example).  \n\n# OBJECTIVES, CONTRACT, AND AUTHORITY  \n\nHaving rehearsed key aspects of the investment sector, the next step is to return to the schematic model of our representative financial institution first introduced in Chapter 4. Our reference point is an asset owner, or asset owner with many of the tasks and functions of an asset manager. Through the elaboration of our model, we have explained the nature and scope of the management ^problem’ facing senior managers; in this chapter we use this model to explain why senior managers of financial institutions might search for cooperation and collaboration with other entities. In doing so, a theoretical rationale is provided for observed practice (see Bachher and Monk 2013; Guyatt 2013), distinguishing between large and small institutions, their functional scope, and the authority of senior managers in relation to the opportunities for cooperation and collaboration outside their organizations.  \n\n### Objectives and Constraints  \n\nIt was assumed in Chapter 4 that our representative institution will maximize the risk-adjusted rate of return on AUM. It does so while seeking to minimize costs even if it is a weak constraint in that sponsors of the institution and its ultimate beneficiaries may have little effective control over the costs incurred in realizing the rate of return. Electronic infrastructure costs, transaction costs, switching costs, salaries, fees, and charges are the responsibility of the institution's board of trustees. Nonetheless, the institution bases its planned rate of return on forecast liabilities and income objectives. In some cases, the sponsor and/or beneficiaries may ultimately be responsible for forecast liabilities and objectives, although this is of limited significance over the short to medium term.  \n\nIt is apparent, however, that the institution's liabilities and objectives are priced in local currencies. Furthermore, its home jurisdiction normally imposes regulations on the organization to ensure that its effective operating space-time horizon combines local circumstances with global financial markets. To the extent that customary practice is rewarded by a better than average performance over time, local opportunities may claim the centre of our representative institution's investment strategy—-even if the original conditions producing those returns no longer prevail. Not surprisingly, the institution's strategic asset allocation exhibits home bias relative to the global map of market capitalization and performance (as with other similarly placed institutions). This tends to reinforce the isolation of local financial institutions and their senior managers—-in effect, they are competitors for the premium on local risk-adjusted rates of return. If alliances are sought with other institutions, they tend to come from other jurisdictions.  \n\n### The Employment Relation  \n\nAs explained in Chapter 5, the option to make or buy is a choice between insourcing and outsourcing the production of the institution's target riskadjusted rate of return. For financial institutions, this translates into a choice between directly employing the requisite portfolio managers and entering into service contracts with third-party providers on a fee-for-service basis. In effect, outsourcing bundles together desired resources and capabilities into a service contract that sets the target rate of return, the related costs, and the mechanism for renewing or terminating the contract in the future. Insourcing the production of the target rate of return requires the institution to write a set of employment contracts; these need to distinguish between different classes of employees, their significance to the institution, and the market premium that certain types of employees may command because of their skills and expertise. Being close to or distant from the market for talent may also affect the choice between insourcing and outsourcing (Dixon and Monk 2014).  \n\nIn financial institutions, it has proven difficult to maintain standardized contracts applicable to the various investment and non-investment employees who are essential to producing the target rate of return. In part, this is because certain types of services, such as the accounting, actuarial, and custodial ones, must be executed whatever the market conditions. By contrast, portfolio managers are literally in the market' in the sense that their performance depends on their skill and expertise in making bets for and against the other market participants in their asset class or segment of the financial market. The more transparent a market segment or asset class, the more likely senior managers will be able to rely on chance as opposed to skill and expertise: the more opaque a market segment or asset class, however, the higher the reward that successful portfolio managers can extract from the host institution. At the limit, successful portfolio managers on the margin of markets can trump the authority of senior managers and enterprise-wide employment norms and conventions.  \n\n### Service Contracts  \n\nSmaller financial institutions are unlikely to insource the various tasks and functions that make up their investment strategies and target rates of return.  \n\nIn Chapter 4, this argument was developed by reference to the principles and practices underpinning the production of investment returns. These types of institutions have neither the economies of scale nor the scope to deliver costeffective investment strategies; neither do they have the managerial resources and capabilities required to function effectively in the context of market risk and uncertainty. The solution for such organizations is to hire knowledgeable and experienced managers who can hire and fire external portfolio managers in accordance with the institution's investment strategy and asset-specific goals and objectives. Even larger institutions may use external portfolio managers on service contracts. These types of agreements can augment existing asset-specific investment strategies, access financial products not covered by the institution, and impose discipline on internal portfolio managers who (otherwise) may engage in rent-seeking behaviour.  \n\nThese types of service contracts may be bilateral in the sense that they can be terminated at will. As we explained with reference to Bolton and Dewatripont (2005), bilateral contracts are assumed complete, Pareto optimal, and contestable in that non-performance can bring forth claims for redress that, if necessary, can be realized in court. However, these types of contracts are hardly ever exclusive because the tasks and functions that the external portfolio manager provides are in the sole interest of the institution. The large investment management companies offer pooled investment vehicles by asset class, style of investment, sector, and geographical focus; however, they are available to such a wide variety of clients that they tend to manage the product rather than long-term relationships with clients. Notice that external portfolio managers offer clients a range of services with and without preferential pricing and conditions, depending on the volume of assets placed with the provider. For example, a relatively large placement of assets is likely to attract a discount on costs, private briefings, and direct engagement on issues of relevance.  \n\nIn effect, smaller clients face significant costs—including the possible ones associated with knowing little about the organization and the real-time performance of external portfolio managers. Predictably, smaller institutions are likely to come late to successful portfolio managers and are prone to stay longer with one whose luck has run out. In any event, large and small clients face significant search costs in discovering appropriate external portfolio managers, estimating their performance in the short and long term, and measuring it against that of their competitors (including internal managers) in circumstances where market conditions are rarely repeated. It is hardly surprisingly, therefore, that smaller institutions tend to favour local opportunities and to want to maintain the status quo.  \n\nMediating the status quo bias are investment consultants employed to widen the geographical and functional scope of any search for internal and external managers. Here, as explained in Chapter 9, the effectiveness of consultants depends on (1) the specification of their mandates, (2) their skills and expertise (in specific domains), (3) their networks, especially beyond the local situation, and (4) the authority of senior managers in relation to the choice of options the consultants present. Staying with a relatively poorperforming provider (whether internal or external to the institution) can be taken as representative of shortcomings at each stage of the search process.  \n\n### Authority and Convention  \n\nSenior managers face a problem in trying to promote innovation among existing in-house portfolio managers in that any radical attempt to alter the process of investment management and/or the nature of investment products is likely to run up against the industry norms and conventions that exist within and between financial institutions, whether these are asset-specific or otherwise. The market for talent offers attractive opportunities to the best performing portfolio managers who are unwilling to put an institution's interests before their own. Then again, external portfolio managers resist at every turn asset owners’ attempts to rewrite the terms of engagement. As noted in Chapter 6, in recognition of the transaction costs involved in agreeing to a new kind of contract that concedes significant authority to the client, the vast majority of institutional clients are offered terms and conditions on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.  \n\nBy our account, senior managers of financial institutions are predisposed to consider joining initiatives that break with local convention; the options of make or buy do not necessarily add to managers^ authority or flexibility in terms of promoting organizational innovation in either the process or the nature of investment management. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis (GFC), the ongoing euro crisis, and now a global downturn, senior managers of many large and small financial institutions have actively sought alternatives to the make-or-buy logic that hitherto has dominated the investment management industry. Quantitative easing, stock market appreciation, the rush to and from emerging markets, and sudden shifts to risk-on/risk-off have separately and together raised concerns about the sustainability of past ways of doing business. Senior managers have looked to cooperation and collaboration with other asset owners as a means of breaking with convention.  \n\n# MODES OF INNOVATION  \n\nCooperation and collaboration offer participants a level of informality missing from conventional modes of contracting, whether with in-house employees or external service providers. Being on the outside of commercial contracts and relationships makes it possible, through cooperation and collaboration, to explore the costs and benefits of organizational innovation, given the fixed form of the participating institutions. The parties to cooperation and collaboration either do not need, or do not require, contracts to participate. It is deemed sufficient to operate in the shadow of mutual obligation, relying on social norms and conventions to govern participation. In this section, we explain what we mean by collaboration and cooperation, and suggest that these strategies are related but different in important ways.  \n\n### Cooperation  \n\nPerhaps the simplest way for senior managers of financial institutions to extend their understanding of innovation is to cooperate with other institutions. As we understand it, cooperation involves shared projects, agreed expected outcomes, and well-defined mechanisms governing entry to and exit from such arrangements. More often than not, senior managers have overlapping interests, so by cooperating on a project they immediately gain knowledge and understanding, even if not in terms of their institution's capacity to realize target risk-adjusted rates of return. In this respect, cooperation is often driven by a specific issue that senior managers who see other financial institutions as peers rather than rivals recognize as important. If cooperation is to be effective, there must be symmetry to ensure that one party does not expropriate the benefits of cooperation that the parties to an agreement share equitably, if not equally (Olson and Zeckhauser 1966).4  \n\nThe mechanism governing cooperation is important. Formalism is a virtue because it forces explicit consideration of the costs and benefits of joining others outside the institution. On the other hand, participants may be more willing to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) than a legal contract in that the former tends to be permissive, whereas the latter tends to carry enforceable commitments. For example, the MoU may begin by acknowledging the limits of the agreement, its intended use as a means of encouraging cooperation, the sharing of responsibilities between partners, and the need for timely decision-making in relation to the opportunities for cooperation. To forestall argument after the fact, the MoU may also establish rules about the distribution of the costs and benefits of cooperation (for example, in proportion to commitment). The MoU could also acknowledge the right of any participating institution to exit at will, just as it may provide for the exclusion of any institution that fails to take part in the consortium's activities.  \n\nGiven the contingent nature and governance of cooperation, as well as the exploratory character of shared projects relative to financial institutions' ongoing operations, it can be difficult for senior managers to devote new resources to cooperative arrangements, especially if they seek to circumvent standard ways of contracting internal and/or external portfolio managers. It is apparent that cooperation is most effective when the parties to such agreements bring something different to the project. Learning is enhanced by difference and distance from related financial institutions, for these might otherwise be regarded as competitors for investment returns (Grabher and Ibert 2013). At the same time, institutions? resources and capabilities must, in some sense, be complementary to ensure that the lessons the participants learn through shared projects are useful to them (Cohen and Levinthal 1990). Complementarity also enables institutions to bring together resources and capabilities that, when combined, provide options and insight for innovation not otherwise available to the participating institutions in whole or in part.  \n\nMore formally, cooperation provides senior managers with a variety of related benefits. First, it is a means of mobilizing and sharing knowledge of innovation relevant to the formation of strategic planning. Second, it enhances the senior managers’ power over their own employees, thus avoiding the compromises involved in relying on existing in-house providers to deliver services and information on alternatives. Third, it reduces the power of consultants by providing a check on their value for money (as suggested in Chapter 9). Fourth, it helps to identify and evaluate the fit of a party or parties to a cooperative venture in relation to other possible ventures that require much deeper commitment given market risk and uncertainty. In these ways, cooperation can discount institutional myopia while providing senior managers with options to drive innovation in their own institution (cf. Barnett 2008).  \n\n### Collaboration  \n\nCollaboration involves commitment to a project or projects in terms of both the specification of shared objectives and the means of realizing them. Commitment involves allocating institutional resources and capabilities, monitoring and overseeing the project with respect to its objectives, and supporting the senior managers who sponsor such commitments. Collaboration is likely to require a stronger framework of governance than cooperation, for it is necessary to specify the respective shares of the benefits of collaboration, limits on actual and potential liabilities, and the boundaries of the collaborative agreement with respect to the ongoing operations of project partners. Furthermore, collaboration is also likely to require specification of the mechanisms of objective setting, decision-making, and conflict resolution. Where it involves setting up a separate entity, the powers of that entity and its officers with respect to the collaborating institutions are inevitably well defined (as in a contract).  \n\nAs in cooperation, the parties to a collaborative agreement are likely to pool their existing resources and capabilities. However, this may involve more than a marginal call on their existing ones; they may even need to invest in new ones consistent with the needs of the shared project. As with cooperation, complementarity between the committed resources and capabilities of the participating institutions may be required to facilitate effective collaboration. However, as collaboration evolves in relation to the shared objectives of the parties, the fit between institutions’ resources and capabilities and the needs of the project may become a source of tension between (and within) parties. For example, where additional resources are needed to achieve the objectives of a collaborative project, the character and scope of those resources may be such that should the project be wound up, those resources may not be useful if returned to the participating institutions (see Williamson (1975) on the costs of asset specificity). Senior managers have a stake in the success of collaboration. As such, they face the prospect of escalating commitment: realizing the planned outcomes of collaboration may require repeated calls on the resources of participating institutions, perhaps leading to questions about senior managers? authority within their own institutions.  \n\nMost importantly, the success of collaboration depends on the choice of partner or partners. Not surprisingly, screening and evaluating potential partners is a vital ingredient in ensuring success. As noted, this can be achieved in a variety of ways, including trial runs through cooperative ventures and purchasing independent advice on the virtue or otherwise of potential partners. However, given the constraints on innovation associated with existing in-house and outsourcing arrangements, there are obvious incentives to take calculated risks on joining partnerships with other, less familiar institutions that may not be subject to the same constraints that bind senior managers in their own institutions. Not surprisingly, given the risks associated with departing from convention, collaborative deals are likely to start with modest commitments, goals, and objectives. In stages, commitment may increase as milestones are realized. Senior managers have an interest in maintaining their authority so that exit remains a viable option.  \n\nThere are a variety of risks associated with collaboration (Archetti et al. 2011). Where knowledge and understanding of the motives of other institutions' managers are imperfect, collaboration can give some institutions and their senior managers a setting in which to exploit the resources and capabilities of willing partners. Collaboration can prompt shifting alliances and dependencies among partners, especially when the latter cannot (or will not) honour the initial commitments of their own resources and capabilities to shared projects. Just as importantly, some parties to a collaborative agreement may misrepresent the significance of the project to their own constituents and to the parties to the agreement. This can lead to free riding if the establishment of a collaborative partnership is based on trust. Given these possibilities, senior managers may well consider whether, in establishing collaborative agreements, they might begin as one of the dominant partners and thereby hold other parties to account in terms of meeting their commitments and obligations. Just as importantly, collaborative agreements may evolve from statements of shared commitment to mimic the terms of reference and conditions associated with legally enforceable contracts.  \n\n### Agency and Governance  \n\nConsidering cooperation and collaboration, it is assumed that senior managers have sufficient authority to initiate and oversee projects in these domains. The scope of authority of senior managers is an issue of considerable importance, especially in the light of recurrent and competing claims for special treatment by talented portfolio managers. As markets move, and as investors become more or less sensitive to market volatility, realizing an institution's target rate of return may become increasingly difficult. Senior managers may persist with existing in-house and out-of-house providers, change the mix, even fire out-of-house providers and bring in-house those activities (see Chapter 5). In these situations, senior managers may have strong incentives to initiate cooperative and collaborative projects. There are significant transaction costs in exercising in-house and out-of-house options; cooperation and collaboration can be seen to sustain discretion in situations where it may be difficult to assess the advantages and disadvantages of other options.  \n\nCooperation and collaboration can flourish in an action space that is less formal and certainly less bound by in-house employment relationships and the legal apparatus that regulates outsourcing agreements. This arena for innovation is both figurative and literal in that it is a space for common action outside the immediate institutional environment of senior managers and, in many cases, is conceived of by partners to bring together institutions from other jurisdictions—thereby avoiding the reputational damage that could come from direct comparison. This action space is only possible, however, if participating institutions allow their senior managers to carry through on these ventures in ways that facilitate experimentation, learning by doing. and alliance formation and deformation.  \n\nOver the longer term, it is likely that successful cooperative and collaborative ventures will be absorbed into the institution, whether on an in-house or outsourced basis. This applies especially if these types of ventures claim a significant share of an institution's assets and liabilities, and their risk exposures begin to affect those of the entire institution. Nevertheless, there is a price to be paid for incorporating these ventures into an institution: the favoured status of such ventures may challenge the privileges of incumbent portfolio managers and add a high enough level of complexity to the institution to discount its benefits.  \n\nIn any event, institutions may prefer to spin off these ventures, given that, because markets move and market agents adapt to changing circumstances, success during one phase of the market is no guarantee of future success (Lo 2012). Indeed, senior managers may wish to initiate new kinds of cooperation and collaboration in response to changing market conditions, thus jettisoning previous ventures that proved to be less resilient than expected in the face of unanticipated circumstances. Larger institutions may contemplate implementing a sourcing strategy that combines insourcing and outsourcing with a series of innovative ventures that seek to solve apparent problems found in the existing arrangement of the investment programme, without committing to those ventures over the long term (either internal to the organization or as privileged external suppliers). This type of innovation strategy presupposes a robust governance framework that simultaneously empowers senior managers and protects against unjustified escalation in commitment and costs that come with functional complexity.  \n\n# TRANSFORMINGHOME BIAS  \n\nHere, we move from the logic of cooperation and collaboration to the various ways in which these strategies are realized in practice. We begin with the simplest ways of facilitating senior managers knowledge and understanding of the options available and move on to more complex modes of cooperation and collaboration that require the mobilization and application of scarce institutional resources and capabilities. These instances are meant to represent the various possibilities on offer rather than being an exhaustive list of what is currently available to the industry.  \n\n### Conferences and Research Clubs  \n\nOne of the simplest ways of scoping the available options is to attend international conferences and invited briefings. If commonplace, and an industry in its own right, it is apparent that conferences with specific agendas—tailored to the needs and interests of senior managers in different types of financial institutions—can make a difference to the decisions made about how to proceed. Who is and who is not on the agenda, the topics presented, what can be gleaned from side conversations, and who has something fresh to say are grist for the mil.5 This type of event gives senior managers information with which to challenge their internal and external advisers, placing proffered advice in the context of the home market for innovation. Importantly, these types of events also allow senior managers to discriminate between what is widely accepted and conventional and what is unconventional and subject to dispute.  \n\nRecognizing the costs and benefits of attending such events, research clubs were formed to explore together the interests of related institutions at a price that does not automatically engage the procurement procedures of participating institutions. These clubs tend to be relatively small, with no more than a dozen members, thereby allowing for the realization of benefits otherwise lost when clubs become too large (Buchanan 1965: 8). Crucially, they are comprised of members who can learn from one another; in fact, they often offer the first ones to join an opportunity to invite other institutions with resources and capabilities that are consistent with, but different from, those of the initial participants. As Grabher et al. (2008: 262) observed when discussing communities of learning, these types of organizations include those that are ^deeply involved and widely focused at the same time', switching the focus from the relationship between senior managers and internal and external suppliers to what senior managers can learn about innovation in different jurisdictions. These organizations tend to have a limited life and often depend on the flow of fresh ideas offered to participants that are consistent with their interests.  \n\n### Seeding-related Ventures  \n\nHaving identified the issues to be resolved, one way forward for senior managers is to provide the start-up capital needed to carry forward investment programmes. Seeding start-up ventures are investments in the skills and expertise of those who claim a different perspective on problems that affect much larger investment institutions (contra Barnett's 2008 discounting of the benefits of alliances). Typically, these ventures begin within an established institution, whether an asset owner or asset manager, and then seek independence from the host institution and its priorities and decision-making mechanisms. Seeding gives the new entity assets to manage, services, and sponsorship, which, in the longer term, can attract other institutions. For the sponsoring institution, the new entity can be a site for testing out ideas and solutions without disturbing the existing arrangement of roles and responsibilities. In some instances, geography is the key to success—for example, seeding a new hedge fund in London, a database designer in Silicon Valley, or an emerging market manager in Hong Kong.  \n\nThis mode of innovation supposes that the needs of the sponsor, as well as the skills and expertise embedded in the new entity, mediate the apparent imbalance of power between the sponsor and the new entity. Nonetheless, there are obvious dangers in such relationships: the sponsor could simply walk away with the ideas that the new entity has generated, or its principals could exploit the senior managers? commitment. If successful, these new entities are likely to cast aside the shackles of the sponsor sooner rather than later. Another possible approach is to set up a jointly owned entity for which the investment responsibilities fall outside the scope of existing in-house and outof-house portfolio managers. This type of entity could be domiciled in another jurisdiction and could be the site for experimenting with new forms of compensation, a style of investing that runs counter to portfolio managers in the sponsor's home jurisdiction, or a system of decision-making that is less hierarchical and reliant on a de-centred team-based approach. Inevitably, these types of ventures run the risks (or costs) of being out of sight and out ofmind.  \n\n### Partnerships, Informal and Formal  \n\nIn many jurisdictions, financial institutions coexist with one another with many of the same functions, even if in the final instance they compete over realizing target rates of return. As noted, larger institutions can be more cost-effcient than smaller ones in providing the services associated with investment management. Equally, the larger ones can claim significant discounts from external service providers. In these circumstances, senior managers of small institutions may seek cost-sharing and service-sharing agreements with larger ones, piggybacking on the functional scope of the latter to maintain their cost effectiveness. These types of agreements are informal in the sense that the larger institution is willing to enter into them because sharing services does not conflict with their existing priorities or operational performance.  \n\nThese types of arrangements can form a basis for establishing formal partnerships between local institutions with an interest in compensating for their peripheral location relative to the global market for financial services (Dixon and Monk 2014). In these circumstances, large and small institutions often face the prospect of making deals with external providers, which, because of the size of the local market, effectively control the terms and conditions for financial services. In addition, the nature and scope of proffered services may be rather limited compared with those of the financial centres at the core of the global financial industry. Enhancing the size and scope of the client side of the local market may be necessary if beneficial institutions are to bypass local providers in favour of the bulge-bracket global providers and the myriad of smaller institutions that offer boutique services from, for example, London or New York. Whether these types of partnerships are possible depends, in part, on the home jurisdiction's competition policies and practices, the balance of power between the buy side and the sell side of the market, and the rivalries among senior managers representing local institutions.  \n\nFor larger institutions, concerned about the organizational complexity that comes with providing the full range of services needed for effective investment management, being a partner in a captive supplier can be a way of externalizing the supply of services, while remaining in control of the costs and quality of those services. For smaller institutions unable to produce their own services, so subject to the market for them, these partnerships provide an equitable relationship with other institutions, which is often missing in fee-for-service agreements. Notice, however, the inherent tensions between large and small partners; the former are always likely to consider the opportunity costs of remaining in such partnerships whereas the latter may have no real alternative. How these entities are governed, the allocation of voting rights, and the degree to which proffered services are innovative are key elements in any longterm partnership.6  \n\n### Investment Clubs and Shared Equity  \n\nGoing beyond partnerships, asset owners have formed investment clubs to accomplish three separate but related objectives. In the first instance, these clubs have sought to join members whose interests are aligned, and whose goals and objectives are consistent over a sequence of deals extending into the future. In the second instance, these types of clubs often depend on relationships with investment managers whose own incentives are demonstrably consistent with those of members of investment clubs. In the third instance, the size and scope of the deals involved are such that they can justify the commitment of time and effort of senior managers of investment institutions in realizing shared goals. Here, the make-or-buy option is subsumed by a third option, which is a form of collaboration underwritten by transparency and accountability within institutions, among institutions, and between an institution and its partners. These types of entities can be found, for example, in the private provision of urban infrastructure.?  \n\nThis mode of promoting innovation in the investment process is closely related to the private equity industry where general partners (GPs) organize a stream of investment opportunities orchestrated through the fund or funds they control, and in which asset owners or limited partners (LPs) invest. In some cases, these types of funds bring LPs with previous knowledge and experience together with each other and with the sponsoring GP. Even so, the relationship between the GP sponsor and the participating LPs can be variable—depending on the volume of assets committed, shared expertise and knowledge, and past relationships with one another. Indeed, notwithstanding common contracts and letters of commitment, side deals are often struck between the sponsoring GP and privileged LPs, thus excluding the less privileged LPs. It is arguable that these types of deals are less about cooperation and collaboration than about fees and the disbursement of benefits. Nonetheless, to the extent that senior managers control entry and exit from these deals, these arrangements can provide opportunities to remake or realign the makeOr-buy option spread.  \n\n# IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS  \n\nThe premise underpinning this chapter is that asset owners have shown a surprising lack of institutional innovation. The current organization and management of these institutions typically reflects their establishment, in many cases looking back over fifty to seventy years. This is remarkable given the transformation of the investment management industry over the past twenty-five years, and the rate of product innovation found in global financial markets. The stasis of the sector has been such that these types of financial institutions have, on the margin, taken higher levels of risk in the hope of realizing returns that could compensate for low rates of institutional adaptation and development. At the limit, the crisis facing the US state and local public pension-fund sector is illustrative of the costs and consequences of institutional stasis (see Chapter 7).  \n\nIn this chapter, we focused on the senior managers of a representative financial institution. These agents have been identified as key to realizing investment goals and objectives; we suggest that the option to make or buy (namely in-house management versus outsourcing) has not always provided an adequate action space for innovation. Reliance on employment contracts has sometimes resulted in manager entrenchment, while reliance on external providers is often accompanied by difficulties in systematically discriminating between luck and skill (given informal alliances between asset managers, consultants, and advisers). In any event, industry-wide norms and conventions that favour continuity over innovation can compromise the senior managers' authority and control over portfolio managers. We have emphasized the benefits for senior managers of cooperation and collaboration, which in effect bypass the make-or-buy option and provide an action space for experimentation and learning that can then be applied to their own operations or to their relationships with external providers.  \n\nWe noted that cooperation facilitates learning and innovation, even if inherent limits on longer-term commitment can discount the implementation internally and externally to the institution. We also noted that collaboration requires commitment, as well as the application of scarce institutional resources and capabilities. As has been widely observed, it is commonplace for institutions in the sector to economize on governance and management, assuming that professional standards are suffcient to carry decision-making in a rather benign financial environment (Clark and Urwin 201o). Recurrent crises in the core markets of the global financial system have challenged this assumption; indeed, recent research suggests that crises are endemic to developed economies? financial markets (Haldane and May 2011). Ultimately, the value of collaboration is found in the enhancement of institutions' investmentrelated capabilities (Helfat et al. 2007).  \n\nMuch of the research on innovation in the social sciences is on product innovation. Here, we are less concerned with what prompts the transformation of products, with how the flow of product innovation is channelled and communicated, or with the status of communities or networks of innovation (Von Hippel 2005). Rather, we are concerned with the emergence of new modes of organization, given continuity in institutional form and functions (Padgett and Powell 2012: 1-2). Perhaps surprisingly, in this chapter we suggested that current practices (make or buy) are a constraint on the nature and scope of innovation. Whether reliant on employment contracts (insourcing) or service contracts (outsourcing), senior managers face significant constraints on institutional innovation associated with the entrenchment of past practices. On the other hand, we also showed that senior managers can create for themselves and for their institution action spaces that facilitate innovation, which, if not particularly revolutionary, may well be transformative over the longer term.  \n\nIn any event, financial institutions are, more often than not, reactive to events. Even if senior managers are able to anticipate changing market conditions and the realignment of internal and external relationships, there is sufficient noise in financial markets to ensure that doubts can always be raised about the urgency of ‘agendas for change'. On the other hand, big events such as the GFC, the ongoing euro crisis, and the slowing global economy can fundamentally alter perceptions about the desirability of the status quo. In these circumstances, senior managers may be empowered to rewrite the terms of employment contracts and service agreements with external providers. Indeed, entirely new initiatives may claim centre stage. Here, innovation in institutional form and functions is perceived to be the solution to the apparent disconnection between what is inherited and the new realities of global markets.  \n\n# NOTES  \n\n1. Gennaioli et al. (2013: 1331) suggest that shadow banks ^originate or acquire both safe and risky loans, and can finance these loans from [their] own resources as well as by issuing debt'. By contrast, the legal form and responsibilities of pension funds and the like are quite different from shadow banks, which operate quite literally in the shadow of their corporate sponsors in either offshore or onshore jurisdictions.  \n\n2. Whether beneficial financial institutions face competition for the flow of funds varies by jurisdiction. Even in countries like Australia, where pension-plan participants have the right to switch between ^competing? funds, the rate of switching is low, concentrated among a few participants, and mixed in terms of the benefit that comes with it. As Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) note, inertia is characteristic of pension-plan participants.  \n\n3. See recent moves in the United Kingdom not only to outsource the management of pension funds, but also to shift fiduciary responsibilities to commercial entities. In a similar manner, there have been moves to sell both the management of assets and the obligation to pay future benefits off to insurance companies and special purpose vehicles. These developments are explained in Clark and Urwin (2010).  \n\n4. With its focus on the costs of inertia for organizational innovation in the absence of a market for institutional control, this chapter can be read as an analysis of the consequences of size in the financial industry. As such, it resonates with related treatments of large organizations, including Jensen (2ooo), even if our representative institution is fundamentally different from commodity-producing firms.  \n\n5. Institutions enter into cooperative agreements to realize some benefit, even if marginal, to the status quo; such agreements are assumed Pareto optimal (Olson 1965). However, any cost-benefit analysis of cooperation needs to be mindful of the differing time horizons of participating parties and the variable nature of expected benefits. It also needs to be mindful of the trade in costs and benefits within and among cooperative arrangements by parties that may seek longer-term relationships that promote common benefits rather than the immediate payoffs that each party claims (Fehr and Schmidt 1999).  \n\n6. Some events mix together asset owners and managers, whereas others discriminate against asset managers in the hope of building coalitions or alliances among clients. See Bathelt and Gluickler (2011: chapter 9) for an extensive treatment of the benefits and orchestration of what they term ‘temporary clusters'. At the limit, these are networks rather than places in the manner suggested by Benkler (2006).  \n\n7. In a related vein, Hachigian (2013) argues that public-private partnerships (PPPs) joining together financial institutions, governments, and construction companies in the provision of urban infrastructure and other similar large-scale projects have often failed to realize the promised benefits for all parties because of misalignments of interest and poor governance procedures and processes. Whether to join a partnership can be seen as a different problem from that of realizing the benefits of a partnership over time.  \n\n### 11  \n\n### Reframing Finance  \n\nWith the relative slowdown of the Chinese economy and the concomitant slowdown in economic integration and trade, institutional investors are unlikely to reap a rate of return anything like that of the past twenty-five years. At the same time, the global financial crisis (GFC) and its aftermath has disrupted confidence in existing models of institutional investment, leaving many institutional investors questioning their core assumptions and beliefs, many of which have persisted for half a century. Accordingly, a lot of investors are re-evaluating the manner in which they will attempt to hit their (high) expected return targets. As such, we are now seeing, for the first time in decades, a sincere interest among institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign funds, and endowments, in new and innovative models of investing. As such, the asset-owner industry, which has been focused on efficiency for the better part of a century, is now faced with the challenge of figuring out how to be innovative, which seemingly goes against the DNA of many of these organizations.  \n\nThis is largely because there are fewer pressures on institutional investors to change and innovate than there are on their private, commercial counterparts. Most asset owners have a legal right to represent the interests of écaptive' beneficiaries. To be fair, some funds have sought to disintermediate, or simply to reintermediate, asset managers in the pursuit of more aligned, long-term models of investment (Clark and Monk 2011; Monk et al. 2017). However, this type of behaviour has been rare (Ambachtsheer 2014). The large majority of pension funds have made no meaningful changes to the way they do business in decades, for they are often embedded in particular economic and political environments that seem to constrain rather than encourage evolution. Even sophisticated institutional investors, like certain endowments, have been slow to change, for they tend to focus their innovative endeavours on the kinds of investments they pursue rather than on questioning the ways in which they themselves invest capital.  \n\nIn sum, the world of institutional investment is changing too slowly to keep up with either the dynamic underlying economy or the increasingly complex and challenging financial ecosystem. In addition, since the investment world is likely to continue to change at a rapid pace, this stagnation will become progressively more problematic. The rise in artificial intelligence, big data, and social networking are but three technological innovations that could threaten core financial service industries. The business of investing will almost certainly not revert to anything approaching that of the 1980s, or even 1990s, which is when most of the models of institutional investment were founded. Going forward, institutional investors that can be innovative will prosper and succeed (Clark and Urwin 2007, 2008b, 2008c). Those that allow inherited organizational and operational characteristics to dictate their plans may find themselves in trouble.  \n\nIn this concluding chapter, we thus discuss the ways in which asset-owner investors can catalyse change and innovate prudently. While many articles have been written about the asset management industry and how it is changing in the face of new technological threats, we purposefully view the world through the lens of those institutional investors searching for organizational innovation and reconfiguration to meet their long-term objectives in a challenging world. We examine the forces underpinning change among pension funds and sovereign funds (among others) and consider the imperatives driving these investors towards different forms of management and governance. Moreover, we consider why innovation is necessary and, in turn, focus explicitly on how these funds can, and even should, innovate. In particular, drawing on Teece et al. (1997), we look at the mechanisms that permit dynamic capabilities within an institutional investor and focus on how they can exploit assets today while exploring new assets for the future.  \n\nBecause the pace of economic and technological change is unlikely to slow down, it will take us even further from the foundations of our current finance and investment ecosystem. As such, we conclude that innovation—-and the capacity to innovate prudently—will provide an important competitive advantage to institutional investors in the decades to come. We seek to give asset owners the tools they need to innovate from within (Battilana et al. 2009).  \n\n# A REASON FOR BEING  \n\nInstitutional investors, like pension funds, endowments, and sovereign funds, exist because their sponsors decide to manage a set of future liabilities and/or uncertainties by setting aside financial assets for investment in financial markets (see Chapter 2). One can simplify the rationale for doing this by reducing it to two key drivers. First, prefunding provided an assurance that sponsors made credible and legitimate promises, that is, they could actually meet their future obligations. Second, the prefunded financial assets would also, it was hoped, grow faster than either the sponsor or the overall economy, which meant that future liabilities could be met at a relative discount today. Embedded in both these factors was the assumption that financial markets offered a reliable mechanism for managing long-term objectives, thus allowing institutional investors to achieve their corporate and financial goals in the long run. These assumptions are currently being tested.  \n\nDespite a clear reliance on financial markets to achieve objectives, the sponsors of the plans we study rarely allow their funds to build up suffcient capabilities to invest assets directly in financial markets. Rather, they believe that they would be better served by seeing their investment organizations as simple conduits into financial markets; in other words, they prefer to buy the talent of the professional financial services industry rather than create it themselves (see Chapter 5). In this respect, the institutional investors’ job was (and more often than not still is) to contract investment management services from external asset managers (see Chapters 6 and 7 for a detailed discussion). It was the private asset managers (and not the institutional investors) that made the actual investments in stocks, bonds, or other financial securities. In addition, institutional investors had an array of consultants, accountants, auditors, actuaries, and custodians to help share the oversight and burden of managing these assets (see Chapter 8).  \n\nAs this suggests, the traditional institutional investor was almost entirely outsourced, so rarely possessed the internal expertise or competence needed to execute even the most basic financial transactions without the help of some external adviser. Put differently, the sponsors of institutional investment organizations were seemingly comfortable with the idea that the success of their funds was a function of the effective oversight and management of a long chain of principal-agent relationships. For example, such relationships might bring together owners (elderly), sponsors (governments), institutional investors (pension funds), asset managers (Wall Street), and advisers (consultants). To orchestrate this complex symphony of risks, products, service providers, and obligations, pension funds were utterly dependent on intermediaries. They used external managers to deploy capital. The boards and senior managers also often relied on consultants to set strategy and asset allocation.  \n\nTo be fair, this model of institutional investing seemed to work for a while, thanks in large part to a series of bull markets, which seemed to paper over the misalignment of interests growing between asset owners and managers. Over time, however, the extended chain of principal-agent relationships became problematic. In particular, the injection of new incentives and motivations at each link of the chain served to distort the original motives of the asset owners into a signal that maximized value for the managers. In short, the disjointed process of asset allocation and investing often led to suboptimal choices, and the ultimate investment decisions that the asset managers made maximized their own utility rather than that of the asset owners; this phenomenon is referred to as a broken agency problem (Sheffer and Levitt 2010).  \n\nBroken agency stems from a misalignment of interests due to an inappropriate distribution of risks and expected returns among the principals and agents. It is most obvious in large-scale construction and infrastructural projects where the agents that bear the short-term risk and receive the short-term rewards are different from those that bear the long-term risks and rewards. In finance, broken agency distorts portfolio construction: the portfolios that long-term investors would like to hold and those that they actually hold are quite different due to an over-reliance on short-term-oriented asset managers. This is the broken agency of institutional investing, and the source of this agency conflict ultimately stems from the silent nature of the ultimate owner of the assets. Some participants or beneficiaries own the actual assets within an institutional investor (Morrison and Wilhelm 2008), but these true principals rarely, if ever, are seen or heard from (Black 1992).  \n\nWhat can be done? The only way to ensure an alignment of interests among all these parties would be to identify intermediaries and service providers that can truly take a long-term view. This is sound in theory, but, in practice, it is difficult to achieve. It is rare to find private-sector asset managers willing to make decisions that will benefit a portfolio twenty or even ten years in the future. In addition, it is rare to see asset owners capable of managing the endto-end investment process required to take a life-cycle perspective.  \n\n# THE CASE FOR INNOVATION  \n\nInstitutional investors organize their production to realize a given objective, typically communicated to management in the form of a return target (see Chapter 2). To achieve this, investors are obliged to make a series of strategic decisions on asset mix, market access points, and the execution of investment strategies (Campbell and Viceira 2002). In making these decisions, institutional investors will tend to have three key resources within the organization— human capital, systems, and processes. It is important to note that the fund's level of sophistication in these three areas will tend to drive the organization's decisions about assets, access, and execution. It is also important that investors balance their ambitions in terms of returns with the organization's resources in these three critical domains.  \n\nThe problem we find with many of our case studies is that the ambitions of sponsors are often out of line with the investment organization's resources; for example, pension or sovereign funds may be expected to generate a return that is incompatible with the realities of either the market or the fund. In other words, the organizations lack the systems, personnel, or information needed to generate the requested returns. This is manifest, for example, in the case of a government putting undue pressure on a board to maintain a high discount rate, with a view to keeping the reported liability small and freeing space in the government's budget for other spending (or simply maintaining a credit rating). The expected discount rate is a fiction drawn from a goal-seeking exercise, but the rate protects politicians' short-term spending.  \n\nTo make this fiction plausible, the board has to ‘work' with actuaries and consultants to set an asset allocation policy that can actually justify the high discount rate. This means asking the plan to take on high risk, which is the only way to increase the expected return calculation provided by the actuaries as the discount rate. The board may or may not realize that its fund is not equipped to handle this risk, but it is willing to push forward in the hopes of maintaining its funding level. This set of demands from the sponsors (though not the owners) leaves the organization in a very precarious position. Not only are the funds often under-resourced but they are also pushed towards challenging investment environments that can support a high discount rate. Not surprisingly, research shows that these sorts of situations lead to investment underperformance (Andonov et al. 2016).  \n\nGiven that most institutional investors lack human resources, systems, and processes, it is hardly surprising that many are seduced by complex financial products offered by third-party managers. Financial intermediaries are very adept at packaging the risk and return characteristics of underlying assets into a product that institutional investors can easily digest. These products come with a specific risk-return profile that can be combined with other products to construct a credible portfolio to meet the investors' required rate of return. All this intermediation is deemed necessary to manage the growing complexity of the products that intermediaries offer. The result is a world in which the tables are tilted too far in favour of third-party asset managers.  \n\nAs evidence of this, research has started to quantify and define the areas of misalignment between the owners and managers of assets. For example, if an asset owner has difficulty getting transparency into a manager relationship, the former is often ^gamed’ on fees by the latter (Foster and Young 2010). In addition, the confusing nature of management contracts too often allows managers to overcharge for low or average performance (Phalippou 2009). Robinson and Sensoy (2013) show that managers with higher fees in fact generate higher returns, but do not share the additional returns with limited partners (LPs). Numerous papers show that the incentives that standard compensation contracts give to managers allow them to manipulate returns (see Bebchuk and Fried 2004; Carpenter 2000; Starks 1987). Worse still, most institutional investors are not even aware that they are getting a bad deal (MacIntosh and Scheibelhut 2012; Sharpe 2013); this is because information is distorted along the long chain of intermediaries, which makes oversight all the more difficult (Leiblein et al. 2002).  \n\nIn sum, plan sponsors often prevented twentieth-century institutional investors from developing the internal capabilities needed to manage these increasingly complex relationships, which has greatly handicapped them visa-vis twenty-first-century investing realities. In the wake of the financial crisis, however, the community of institutional investors is increasingly pondering novel business models. To be clear, they are not just considering new and exciting investment products coming from third-party managers; they are considering new ways of investing. In a slowing global economy with diminished confidence in the long-term prospects of public financial markets, many institutional investors are looking to innovation to meet expected return targets. At issue, then, is the degree to which the broader community of long-term, institutional investors will be able to change their organizations enough to be successful in the decades to come.  \n\n# PRUDENT INNOVATION  \n\nIn our research, we have found that when people see institutional investment organizations large pools of assets under management (AUM), they assume that they can be tapped for internal resources in the three key domains underpinning the production of returns—-process, people, and information. However, that is an incorrect assumption because there are often strict firewalls between the investment capital of these funds and their operating budgets, which means that the latter are usually inadequate for managing the former. There is also often little short-term pressure to develop competitive capabilities within these funds, for there are no competitive threats. In general, institutional investors enjoy a monopoly in that they have a legal right to represent the interests of a ‘captive’ beneficiary, which further erodes the impulse to professionalize and equip the organization properly.  \n\nIn our view, governance will be crucial in overcoming the deficiencies of investor innovation. The independence of the organization, its resources and systems, and an ability to identify areas of opportunity and challenges are all crucial elements of governance that can have a dramatic impact on the success of any innovation policy. Therefore, before investors can take on innovative challenges and make operational changes, the organization should first assess its governance capabilities to determine whether a given investment strategy is commensurate with its organizational skills. The idea is to root the fund's investment style and strategy in a clear assessment of the organization's capabilities and the resources at the disposal of its staff. Much like using a 'risk budget to guide portfolio construction and investment decision-making. institutional investors should use a ^governance budget to guide the process of investing, the development of the organization, and the guidance of management (Clark and Urwin 2008a, 2010).  \n\nGovernance budgets are comprised of three ingredients. These are (1) the amount of time that a fund's board can apply to a given investment problem, (2) the level of expertise that can be called upon at the level of the board, and (3) the commitment of the board, which refers to its effectiveness at getting things done. This refers to the dynamic capabilities of the board (for example, real time versus calendar time meetings). We can look at each of these as being scarce resources that can be drawn down as a fund engages in more innovative or risky behaviour. Thinking about governance budgets, then, should become just as important as thinking about asset allocation or manager selection, especially for funds interested in bringing assets in-house.  \n\nDeveloping a governance budget first requires cataloguing the resources and assets that can drive sustainable returns. In general, these include the talent and skills of portfolio managers; the processes and protocols of decisionmaking; and the information-processing tools that support judgements. In other words, the people, processes, and protocols are what seem to matter most in this business (Clark and Monk 2014), but from where do these people, processes, protocols, and systems ultimately come? The board makes these resourcing decisions and controls the strategic levers of success. A fund's governance budget, which ultimately refers to the resources available to it to build investment operations, is thus a crucial determinant of an investor's capacity to innovate and has clear relevance to insourcing. In sum, any fund considering an innovation policy should first check to ensure that its governance budget aligns with its new risk budget. If the required levels of governance exist, then the fund can begin to develop the organization in accordance with the strategy.  \n\nUnfortunately, most of the investors reading this will recognize that their governance is often underprepared for innovation. As Clark (2015) notes, instead of looking forward and being part of a process whereby community norms and conventions adapt to a changing environment, trustees may seek refuge in the past where certainty prevails, albeit at the cost of reinforcing convention. To execute an innovative investment strategy successfully, many funds will have to restructure their own internal governance. Changing a fund's governance, however, is not easy, which is why it helps to assess what strategies are possible in the context of an existing governance budget (Clark and Urwin 2010).  \n\n# CATALYSTS FOR INNOVATION  \n\nThe key ingredient driving the long-term success of an institutional investor is its governance. As noted, governance is the mechanism that can mobilize an institution's resources to realize its objectives. It can also create new resources (or further develop existing ones). Whether the fund is considering creative products or developing certain products of its own, new resources will be required. The real question, then, is how a management team can actually get its board to mobilize the resources needed to be creative and innovative. In our research, we uncovered four ways in which an organization can secure the resources it requires to be innovative. These are (i) extra-financial objectives, (ii) fees and cost transparency, (i) collaboration and cooperation, and (iv) competitive advantages.  \n\n### Extra-financial Objectives  \n\nMany long-term investors have stakeholders that want them to consider extrafinancial criteria in their investment process. While this is generally viewed in the pension community as a distraction and potential drag on returns, it is also an opportunity to innovative. Take the world of sovereign development funds (SDFs) as an example. SDFs are strategic, government-sponsored investment organizations with dual objective functions—to deliver high financial performance while fostering development. Our research has found that some SDFs have used this dual objective to develop innovative investment approaches that have, in turn, driven attractive investment returns (Clark and Monk 2016). An SDF requires innovation because there are no off-the-shelf products that these funds can buy that will deliver on the investment and development objectives simultaneously, which means that they are obligated to develop novel skills and expertise. In short, the extra-financial mandate helps a management team justify the development of internal expertise, which, in turn, helps it realize investment returns from a proprietary knowledge of local opportunities, privileged access to those opportunities, and trusted relationships with other investors. Moreover, SDFs are not the only ones to take advantage of this; other investors can use similar extra-financial constraints, be they environmental or governance, to develop unique and commercially valuable competencies.  \n\n### Fees and Cost Transparency  \n\nHelping institutional investors get fees, and cost transparency is, in our view, a very effective way of unlocking additional resources for internal innovation and change. This is because most asset-owning boards have no real understanding of the scale of the fees and costs they are paying to external service providers. Accordingly, neither the boards nor the sponsors of these organizations have invested in the professionalization and innovation of their investment teams, for they have not yet seen the true cost of the outsourced investment model. The present value of the average fees that asset owners paid to asset managers over a thirty-year period amounts to approximately onethird of the assets invested, which is a lot to pay a manager who is not, on average, going to beat passive benchmarks (Greenwood and Scharfstein 2013). Paying an internal investment team $\\$20$ million dollars may seem costly on its own, but it is cheap if you consider that the same service and performance costs $\\$200$ million a year when paid to a team outside a pension fund (CEM Insights 2010). Our logic here is simple: if a pension fund or endowment board let alone its sponsor or the general public—saw how much its plans were paying Wall Street for its products, asset owners would be forced to change the way they operate (Ellis 2012). Importantly, our research has found many pension funds that have used fee and cost transparency to secure greater internal resources for innovative projects.  \n\n### Collaboration and Cooperation  \n\nWe have found that cooperation and collaboration among investment organizations facilitate innovation because they offer participants an ‘action space' in which to be informal and yet in some way committed to a project (see Chapter 9). As it turns out, resources cobbled together on the margin from a handful of organizations can end up being suffcient to take on a new project of some importance. This type of informal interaction is unavailable in conventional contracting with either internal employees or external service providers, for it generally allows participants to wind down and reduce commitments quickly if the innovation proves unsuccessful (Williamson 1975). In sum, cooperation and collaboration facilitate the pooling of numerous small resource commitments to achieve a large objective. This is done by bringing like-minded organizations and managers together around mutual problems with a view to developing common solutions. This lowers the barrier to commencing a project, for the expenses and resources are shared among parties. It is also worth noting that if a pension can convince its peers, which are also fiduciaries, to work with it on something innovative, it has, almost by definition, fulfilled its obligations under the prudent person rule. It can also smooth the process of doing something innovative.  \n\n### Competitive Advantages  \n\nInstitutional investors face a challenging market in which their expected return targets are high, but future market returns are projected to be low. This means that investors will have to do something different from what they did to achieve their objectives. One mechanism that we have seen investors focus on is their own competitive advantage and the ways they use this to drive higher returns. Some investors catalogue their competitive advantages to build a case for innovation in certain privileged domains in which they alone can invest with less competition. To do this, investment organizations must understand and know how to promote their unique characteristics and acquire the resources needed to develop novel access points. Generally, the advantages that these investors enjoy come from scale, time, liquidity, social acceptance, and even privileged access to deals within the sponsor's area of oversight. Without a detailed list of these advantages, it can be very challenging for investors to secure the resources they require.  \n\nWe have found asset owners using all four of these catalysts to drive their innovative strategies or policies. In all cases, management teams used each of these to secure needed resources—-and to expand the governance budget—- with a view to pursuing innovation.  \n\n# INNOVATION IMPLEMENTED  \n\nFinancial markets are akin to ‘innovation machines’ that test investors' fitness to succeed; investors who can move quickly to identify and exploit opportunities can reap large rewards. Having reviewed in this chapter the importance of good governance and how to mobilize the needed resources via catalysts, we now reflect on the actual implantation of innovation. Numerous constraints prevent these organizations from actually being innovative.  \n\nIt is very difficult to study how innovation policies might be implemented among asset owners, as there are almost no case studies from which to draw inspiration. Indeed, few investment organizations “have well-established and specialized expertise in the area of management innovation' (Birkinshaw et al. 2008: 830). In fact, in our fieldwork over the past ten years, we have only come across one institutional investor with a dedicated group focused exclusively on the research and development (R&D) of innovative investment approaches, tools, methodologies, or even technologies. There are, to be sure, ‘special opportunity’ groups and ‘special situation’ teams; in fact, most investment organizations will have a strategy team that can do some applied R&D work. However, none of these groups can be accurately characterized as delivering innovation to the overall investment organization. How, then, should institutional investors implement innovation? In this case, we are forced to draw inspiration and insights from other industries.  \n\nAs the literature points out, organizations that are skilled at exploiting value are often ill equipped to explore new value (Lubatkin et al. 2006; O'Reilly and Tushman 2004; Rivkin and Siggelkow 2003). You can think of an organization that is adept at exploitation as highly efficient, while one that is successful at exploration is good at searching for and understanding variations that can affect performance. The latter would be seen as innovation. As March (1991) noted, most organizations are poor at combining efficiency and innovation. Yet, both factors are required for survival among firms. “The basic problem confronting an organization is to engage in sufficient exploitation to ensure its current viability and, at the same time, devote enough energy to exploration to ensure its future viability' (March 1991: 105). While this may be a pervasive problem for all industries, it affects institutional investors especially strongly because of their focus on being extremely efficient with internal resources. Put another way, a key challenge facing institutional investors is to bring innovation into a world dominated by efficiency. Moreover, as markets have moved towards shorter and shorter time horizons, investors have been pushed more towards exploitation than exploration (March 2003).  \n\nResearch shows that, over time, the source of a firm's competitive advantage may be the very thing that drives its demise. Tushman and O'Reilly (1996) called this the ^success syndrome'. Yet, some particularly innovative companies in the private sector have managed to evolve and compete for more than two hundred years. Moreover, in explaining the survival of these companies, we see some useful points of departure for investors, namely the importance of dynamic capabilities and the role that leaders play in adapting, integrating. and reconfiguring the assets and resources within an organization (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000; Lavie and Rosenkopf 2006; Teece 2006; Teece et al. 1997). Indeed, there has been a great deal of research on how mature organizations can change to meet new demands (O'Reilly and Tushman 2008) and sustain competitive advantages as environments change around them.  \n\nThe core idea emerging in the literature is that success demands finding ways to combine innovation and efficiency—-exploration and exploitation—-in the context of a single firm. Bringing these two contradictory dynamics together is referred to in the literature as ^organizational ambidexterity', and it is very difficult. Organizational ambidexterity calls for managers to experiment proactively in schemes with long-horizon payoffs (if they ever pay off). This is a challenging thing to do if the resources used could be used to achieve additional short-term profits through exploiting an existing asset base. Because of the unique nature of each organization, reflecting the set of historical decisions that has put it on its unique path, developing dynamic capabilities is itself a dynamic and challenging process. In fact, in his seminal book, Christensen (1997) suggested that exploration and exploitation were so difficult to combine that they required spinning out a subunit.  \n\nNotwithstanding, we use Teece's (2006, 2011) work on dynamic capabilities to highlight the areas in which an investment organization could work to improve its chances of being ambidextrous. These are termed sensing, seizing. and transforming.  \n\n### Sensing  \n\nAn organization has to be able to sense threats and opportunities if it wants to be able to respond to them. This requires intelligence gathering, with a focus on peers, technologies, and changing market factors. This implies that an organization has a plan for where this intelligence needs to be collected, which means having a vision of the future. Investors will want to get as close as possible to a market's edge to be able to appreciate the nuanced or low-volume signals. Management teams will need to cultivate an interest in long-term challenges and opportunities, for those focused on short-horizon exploitation have found it difficult to ‘sense′ threats and opportunities emerging over time (Jackson and Dutton 1988; Tripsas and Gavetti 2000). As Teece (2009: 208) rightly noted, ‘the skills that result in the identification and/or development of an opportunity are not the same as those required to profit from or exploit the opportunity'. In short, without a powerful sensing mechanism, investors will struggle to combine efficiency with innovation (Chapter 3).  \n\n### Seizing  \n\nHaving sensed threats or opportunities, ambidextrous organizations must be able to make smart decisions about which choices to pursue and then to execute them fully (Harreld et al. 2007). For an investor, this generally means having organizational buy-in for a given strategy, which allows resources to be mobilized quickly in the pursuit of opportunities or in defence against threats. This may require investors to develop an explicit capability around learning and even to relearn how to learn. Seizing implies developing a sophisticated set of internal incentives to prioritize long-termism and innovation, which means leadership is a critical component of organizational ambidexterity among investors (Chapter 4). In this context we believe that investors could benefit from a formal R&D team that has a mandate to seize opportunities and move them towards execution and implementation.  \n\n### Transforming  \n\nEven with sensing (adept intelligence, knowledge) and seizing (honed leadership, R&D) capabilities, organizations that want to be ambidextrous always have to be renewing themselves in the face of an environment that is, itself, constantly evolving. This is particularly challenging for institutional investors, for most of them have no existential threats that could jeopardize their survival. They have monopolies over their asset base, which limit the need for permanent renewal and change altogether. Moving assets from mature businesses and refocusing them on emerging opportunities goes against the grain. Again, this is about committing resources to long-term projects that are not necessarily going to produce returns in the short or medium term (Danneels 2002). According to the research, this may require meta-routines in which an organization develops routines that can be used to change other routines (Adler et al. 1999). An example of a meta-routine may be asking people to change jobs on a rotation. In any case, the objective is to institutionalize the allocation of resources to long-horizon projects and opportunities.  \n\nWhen these three components are combined within an investment organization, we expect to see dynamic capabilities emerge. Sadly, we cannot think of a single investment organization that has yet fully applied all three components of organizational ambidexterity. Some are close on these counts, but none has institutionalized policies around sensing, seizing, and transforming. To be fair, there are plenty of innovative investors in the world today, but we should not confuse launching an innovative product or strategy with having dynamic capabilities (Dew et al. 2006; Ebben and Johnson 2005); they are not the same.  \n\nThis is the paradox of long-term investing; these organizations have to be good at two things that seem in direct contradiction with one another (Lewis and Andriopoulos 2009; Slaatte 1968). We hope, however, to find ways of making innovation and efficiency more in tune with each another. Indeed, when done very well, exploration and exploitation cease to be competing activities and can come to complement one another (Chen and Katila 2008).  \n\n# A REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE  \n\nOver the past five years, we, the authors, have worked closely with a variety of endowments, pension funds, and sovereign funds around the world. In all cases, the organizations with which we worked were seeking to improve their governance and management and to launch innovative modes of operation. One fund in particular stands out to us as having displayed many of the concepts and ideas that underpin this book—-developing a governance budget, using the catalysts, and beginning the process of institutionalizing dynamic capabilities and organizational ambidexterity. This organization, which due to confidentiality requirements will remain anonymous, has a long history and has been managing money for decades.  \n\nWith a new leader on board, fresh eyes saw the challenges facing this fund. This person sensed that the fund was underperforming because of a lack of alignment with managers and its blind pursuit of an investment model that had worked well in the past but would unlikely do so in the decades to come. After taking stock of the organization, it was determined that innovative projects could deliver value on a number of different levels. After reviewing the capabilities of the organization and its governance, the team agreed that new resources would be required to change the fund. This raised the question of how the management team would secure the resources from the board with which to effect the change.  \n\nIn making the case, the team reminded the board of the challenging return environment ahead and the need to leverage the fund's unique competitive advantages. The chief information officer (CIO) also engaged a fee and cost consultant, which allowed the management team to demonstrate to the board the high cost of the external service providers and remind his staff and sponsor that alternative methods were actually not only desirable but also a requirement. At the same time, all its stakeholders were pushing the investment organization to take on some non-financial projects, specifically on the environment. The team used these requests to build a more robust investment decisions framework rooted in long-horizon risk management. While this ticked the boxes for environment, it also helped the fund in core commercial areas. Finally, the organization sought to work closely with peers to develop novel investment strategies, so sharing the costs of some of the most audacious innovations. Using these four factors, the CIO secured the crucial resources and buy-in from all stakeholders to be able to pursue the innovation that was necessary for the organization to thrive in the twenty-first century.  \n\nSignificantly, peer collaboration was also the first step towards institutionalizing organizational ambidexterity to implement the innovation. Indeed, the fund saw its peer relationships as useful in 'sensing? opportunities and threats. The team then began trying to seize certain opportunities, using consultants and advisers to scale up and down where needed. In addition, the CIO was willing to take a personal career risk to seize these new opportunities; and so began the implementation of this fund's desired changes. To date, the fund has received many accolades for this innovation and is on track to implement a highly professional and flexible operating model. Our last piece of advice to this fund would be to remember that there is no finish line for innovation; it has to remain on this course of transformation.  \n\n# SOME FINAL THOUGHTS  \n\nIn the wake of the financial crisis, a growing number of plan sponsors have begun to wake up to the misalignment of interests embedded in their principal-agent-based investment model. In fact, the onslaught of recurring financial crises over the past few years has jolted some sponsors to push their own organizations to seek out more aligned models of institutional investment, as many funds now recognize that the long chain of principal-agent relationships has allowed for a distortion of their overarching objectives (Ambachtsheer et al. 2013). In this concluding chapter—and indeed in this book-we have sought to situate asset-owner investors in the increasingly complex and challenging capitalist system and indeed financial markets.  \n\nVery few academic studies have focused like this on asset owners, even though they arguably constitute the foundation of our capitalist system. In Chapter 2, we therefore reminded our readers of the key role of asset managers and of their unique and idiosyncratic nature. In Chapter 3, we set out the rather simple production function of investing by showing that, with the right people, information, and process, all investors generate the same thing—returns. In Chapter 4, we show that the application of these three inputs through leadership, and the decision to make or buy them (Chapter 5), is what truly differentiates investment organizations. However, as we see in Chapters 6 and 7, the process of governing and managing these inputs—-whether it be internal or external—is woefully inadequate. Worse yet, we show in Chapter 8 that the traditional sources of advice and counsel, the consultants, have lost touch with the fundamentals of institutional investing. This, in turn, as we show in Chapter 9, has driven many investment organizations to gather intelligence and counsel from peers and other like-minded organizations. All this brings us to this chapter on reframing finance through innovation.  \n\nThe objective of this chapter—-and indeed of the book—-has been to remind investors of their core function and show them how they can take charge of their futures. This chapter lays plans for how asset owners can mobilize their innovative ideas and, indeed, catalyse their boards to resource them appropriately. We do not mean to suggest here that investors should innovate for the sake of being new and different. Our objective is simply to remind everybody about the basics and push all investors to think about how best to take money, add people, information, and policies, and then make more money. At issue, then, is the degree to which the broader community of long-term institutional investors will be able to change their organizations and the production of investment returns. The twentieth-century production function is unlikely to work in the twenty-first century. This means that innovation is coming to pension funds, sovereign funds, university endowments, charitable foundations, family offices, and other asset-owner investors. We hope that this book helps them to prepare for the changes to come.  \n\n# NOTE  \n\n1. Here it is important to recognize that governance is a finite and measurable resource, and that the investment style and strategy of the organization should match its available levels. Put slightly differently, a fund's governance budget should be reflected implicitly in its planned and expected performance and, explicitly, in its risk budget.  \n\n### Bibliography  \n\nAbolafia, M.

The analysis reveals that foreigners show a preference for large firms, firms paying low dividends, and firms with large cash positions on their balance sheets. When we further analyze the preference for large firms, we find that market liquidity and presence in international markets, measured through export sales or listings on other exchanges, seem to characterize foreign holdings better than firm size alone. Foreigners also tend to underweight firms with a dominant owner. Importantly, we demonstrate that most of the features associated with foreign ownership are driven by the fact that foreign investors typically are mutual funds or other institutional investors. Hence, we identify an institutional investor bias rather than a foreign investor bias. Finally, using ownership data on a country level, we conclude that the results are particularly strong among U.S. investors, who comprise the largest institutions among foreign investors. $\\copyright$ 2001 Elsevier Science S.A.

Introduction  \n\nIt is well documented that the proportion of foreign assets held by domestic investors is too small relative to what is implied by standard portfolio theory. This finding, referred to as the “home bias\", is typically analyzed by comparing the aggregated holdings of investors in foreign markets with their domestic holdings (see Lewis, 1995, 1999, for overviews of the home bias puzzle).  \n\nKang and Stulz (1997) take a different route and study the shareholdings of foreigners in individual firms in a specific market. They find that foreigners investing in Japan tend to underweight smaller and highly leveraged firms. Moreover, they find that holdings are relatively large in firms with large export sales. The overall evidence is consistent with the conjecture that foreigners invest in firms that they are better informed about. Thus, it can be argued that the home bias is driven by informational asymmetries.  \n\nRecently, a number of articles analyze the trading behavior of various investor categories. Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000), for instance, emphasize that the degree of sophistication matters when studying investors in the Finnish market. They report that domestic investors, presumably less sophisticated, take the opposite position of that of more sophisticated foreign investors. This finding holds for both domestic institutional as well as individual investors. Seasholes (2000) discriminates between domestic institutional and retail investors in Thailand and Taiwan, and documents that both categories trade against the fow generated by foreign investors. However, Choe et al. (1999) study the trading pattern on the Korea stock exchange, and show that Korean institutions generally behave like foreign investors.  \n\nThis paper deepens the understanding of holdings of foreign investors and the home bias. By analyzing a rich and detailed dataset of equity ownership, and studying the determinants of foreign ownership in Swedish firms, we identify various firm attributes that are common to foreign ownership. Further, we argue that the type of foreign investor is an important aspect to analyze, with regard to trading and ownership. Our dataset allows us to compare and contrast foreign ownership with the holdings of domestic investors by category. This feature proves to be important for the interpretation of our findings. We are also able to analyze foreign ownership of individual countries and relate foreign ownership to the geographic structure of international investments.  \n\nThe paper proceeds in three steps. In the first step, we characterize aggregated foreign ownership in individual Swedish frms for the period 1993-1997 using firm-specific attributes, such as size, leverage, and current ratio. We further consider various measures of risk as well as the return on the firms' shares on the stock market. We reject the null hypothesis that foreigners invest according to the market portfolio. Foreign ownership seems to be positively related to the market capitalization of firms and the amount of cash on their balance sheets, and negatively related to dividend yields.  \n\nThe preference among foreign investors for large firms can be seen as a proxy for firm recognition and information asymmetries. For instance, in a domestic setting, Coval and Moskowitz (1999) find evidence of a preference among U.S. investors for geographically close investments. We therefore investigate this preference in more detail by introducing variables that capture firm recognition as well as investor influence. The analysis shows significant links between foreign ownership and the new variables. We find, for example, a positive relation between foreign ownership and the market liquidity of a firm's shares, and to its presence in the international goods and services markets, a negative relation between foreign ownership and ownership concentration, and a positive relation between foreign ownership and firms that are listed on international stock exchanges. This evidence is consistent with Merton's (1987) model, in which rational investors prefer firms about which they are better informed. Huberman (1999) phrases this preference in terms of a behavioral bias, namely that “familiarity breeds investment\"'.  \n\nIn the second step, we discriminate between foreign and institutional holdings by employing alternative benchmark portfolios. Since the typical foreign investors in Sweden are institutional investors, we focus on domestic institutional holdings as the benchmark. The analysis reveals that foreign and institutional ownership can be characterized by similar attributes. Our findings support the results in Falkenstein (1996) and Gompers and Metrick (1999). Falkenstein (1996) documents that U.S. mutual funds tilt their portfolios towards large firms, and Gompers and Metrick (1999) find that American institutions invest in firms that are larger, more liquid, and have had relatively low returns during the previous year. These findings mirror our study of foreigners investing in Sweden. Hence, we conclude that we do not find a foreigner bias per se, but rather that institutional investors in general deviate from holding the market portfolio.  \n\nIn the third step, we investigate foreign ownership at a disaggregated level, using ownership data on a country-by-country basis. The analysis suggests that the sensitivity to firm attributes varies across different geographic regions. Our results seem to be most pronounced for the holdings of North American investors, principally from the U.s. Since U.S. institutional investors are the largest foreign investors, this finding supports our view that investor size can determine the extent of the deviation for investors from holding the market portfolio.  \n\nIn summary, the overall results support the findings in Kang and Stulz (1997), that foreign investors tend to have a preference for firms with certain attributes. It can be argued that many of these attributes are proxies for firm recognition and investor influence. However, our results show that the holdings of foreigners are similar to the holdings of other domestic investor categories. As we are able to compare and contrast ownership categories, this paper provides a new angle on previous results. We conclude, in fact, that the bias we find is actually an institutional investor bias rather than a foreign investor bias. In particular, the results seem to be strong for the large U.s. investors.  \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss theoretical arguments for determinants of foreign ownership, and formulate empirical hypotheses to test. Section 3 contains a description of the ownership data, as well as the firm attributes that are used in our analysis. In Section 4 we characterize foreign ownership and document the relation to the various attributes. We also compare the holdings of foreigners with the holdings of domestic investor categories in Sweden. Finally, Section 5 presents our conclusion.  \n\n## 2. Benchmarks and empirical hypotheses  \n\nIn this section, we briefy review some theoretical arguments for the determination of foreign ownership at a country level as well as at the firm level. Furthermore, based on these arguments, we formulate empirical hypotheses to test.  \n\n### 2.1.Benchmarks  \n\nThe home equity bias, which observes that investors show a preference for investing in their home countries, is well documented.1 Most empirical studies of the home bias have used ownership data aggregated on a country level. One exception is Coval and Moskowitz (1999), who find a, within-country, home bias at a regional level among U.S. investors. However, like Kang and Stulz (1997) we employ a firm-specific dataset of the holdings of foreigners in Sweden in the hope that this information will help us understand equity holdings in general, and the home bias puzzle in particular.  \n\nIn the empirical analysis below, we begin by comparing the portfolio of foreign investors with the Swedish market portfolio. The use of the market portfolio as a benchmark can be justified from an international version of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), as considered below. However, when discussing the home bias puzzle, no obvious reference portfolio, including the market portfolio, exists. For this reason, we complement our analysis by constructing a relevant benchmark portfolio. We compare foreign ownership with the holdings of domestic mutual funds, other institutional investors, and individual investors. This comparison makes it possible to discover the presence of a foreigner bias while controlling for other effects, such as the possibility that institutional investors systematically deviate from holding the market portfolio.  \n\n### 2.2. Home bias explanations and some empirical hypotheses  \n\nSeveral potential explanations for the home bias exist. Most arguments fall into one of the following two categories. First, that international investors face barriers in selecting and investing in firms′ shares. Second, deviations from the international CAPM affect foreign investment holdings. While many arguments only have implications for the investor's choice of foreign assets across countries, others will also influence the portfolio choice at the firm level. These arguments help us to formulate empirical hypotheses to test.  \n\nThe first category involves both explicit and implicit barriers. Explicit barriers include foreign exchange control, withholding taxes, and other directly observable obstacles. In developed markets, however, these obstructions have been dramatically reduced over the last twenty years. French and Poterba (1991), Cooper and Kaplanis (1994), and Tesar and Werner (1995) argue convincingly that explicit barriers can no longer explain the observed portfolio allocations. This observed absence of barriers holds true for Sweden during the sample period, since the last investment restriction that applied to foreigners was abolished in 1993. Hence, in this paper, we focus on arguments that are related to implicit barriers.  \n\nImplicit barriers include political, or country, risks and informational asymmetries. Aversion to international investments due to political risk can arise if non-resident investors meet problems associated with the repatriations of income and capital. Due to Sweden's political stability, we will not argue that this factor is important when foreign investors allocate their wealth across Swedishstocks.  \n\nAn aversion towards international investments may also be due to informational asymmetries between foreign and domestic investors. That is, foreign investors may find themselves less informed about a country and its firms. These asymmetries also include the possibility that foreign and domestic investors process information differently due to intellectual or emotional biases. For instance, if investors in general are more optimistic regarding expected returns on the domestic market than on foreign markets, the observed home bias is an implication of this pattern in forming expectations. Merton (1987) and Huberman (1999) argue that investors prefer securities they know about. It seems likely that foreign investors invest in Swedish firms about which they have some knowledge or familiarity.  \n\nWe test different versions of this hypothesis using various proxies for why some firms are better known to foreign investors. In the first set of hypotheses, we conjecture that large firms, measured by market capitalization, are better known abroad than small firms. This measure represents a coarse proxy, since size could be positively correlated with several other properties that may appeal to foreign investors. Thus, as an alternative, we conjecture that firms with large export sales are recognized abroad. Moreover, firms which are listed on other stock exchanges are more likely to be better known.  \n\nWe also study whether issues related to influence affect foreign investors. If investors want to influence the management of a firm, they can, in principal, proceed in two ways. Investors can either use their votes at the shareholders? meeting, or sell their shares and thereby signal their opinions. Tesar and Werner (1995) document that the turnover rate on international equity investments is high both when compared with the turnover rate in the investor's home country, and when compared to the market of the foreign security. Their findings suggest that market liquidity is particularly important for foreign investors. For this reason, we check to see whether this implication is supported by our data. Moreover, if foreign investors have an interest in the management, we would expect them to avoid firms with highly concentrated ownership. Therefore, we use a measure of ownership concentration to test whether foreigners want to be able to directly influence the management of a firm.  \n\nFinally, we investigate the geographic structure of foreigners’ holdings. The conjecture is that investors know more about firms that are geographically close to them. Evidence of this conjecture has been provided by Coval and Moskowitz (1999) in a domestic setting, using data from the money management industry in the U.s. Since our dataset allows us to study the holdings of investors from different countries, we test whether geographic distance is related to ownership.  \n\nIn the second category of explanations of the home bias puzzle, deviations from the international CAPM have been put forth. Under the maintained assumption of perfectly integrated markets for capital and goods, the usual CAPM can be extended to an international setting (see, for instance, Stulz, 1981; Adler and Dumas, 1983). The international CAPM then implies that the world market portfolio is the right benchmark for investors' overall portfolio holdings, and that each local market portfolio is relevant for the holding within a local market. However, the literature has emphasized that investors do not hold the world market portfolio. In extensions of the international CAPM, the optimal portfolio for investors typically also includes a component which relates to a hedging demand.  \n\nIn principal, it is possible that investors want to hedge against any kind of state variable. However, it is impossible to formally test the implications of a hedging demand without a more precise idea of what investors want to hedge. For example, if investors want to hedge against changes in the return on their human capital, they could invest in securities that are negatively correlated with their human capital. Assets in industries other than the one producing the investor's labor income are then natural candidates. Since correlations typically are lower between countries than between different industries within a country, foreign assets may provide a good hedge against changes in the return on human capital. Baxter and Jermann (1997) support this view and show that U.S. investors should actually short the U.S. market portfolio because of its high correlation with the return on human capital. It can also be argued that foreign investors are better off hedging the return on human capital by investing in industries other than those in their domestic markets. We do not, however, elaborate further on this issue.  \n\n## 3. Data description  \n\n### 3.1. Foreign ownership: A first look  \n\nStockholders of all listed firms in Sweden are registered at Vardepapperscentralen, the Security Register Centre. Since many registered owners are custodian banks, additional research is needed to identify the actual owners. In Sweden, this research has been undertaken by SIS Agarservice.? Our dataset includes all Swedish firms listed from 1991 to 1997. For each firm, we can see the share of total equity held by foreign investors at the end of each year.  \n\nIn Fig. 1, the white bars show the aggregate market capitalization of the firms during the period 1991-1997. During the sample period, the price of a U.S. dollar (USD) has varied between 6 and 9 Swedish kronor (SEK). The market value increased by a factor of four, from SEK 535 billion in 1991 to SEK 2136 billion in 1997. In Fig. 1, the cross-hatched part of the bars illustrates foreign ownership. As we can see, during this period foreigners increased their holdings more than 15 times, from SEK 44 billion to SEK 692 billion. In other words, the portion held by foreigners increased from $8.2\\%$ to $32.4\\%$ . The total number of firms is given above the white bars, while the number of firms with positive foreign ownership appears above the cross-hatched bars. The total number of firms during this period is 352, varying from 176 in 1992 to 282 in 1997. In 1991, 126 firms, or $70\\%$ of the total number of firms, had at least one foreign owner. From 1995 onwards, 0ver $99\\%$ of the firms had some foreign ownership.  \n\nThe increased interest from foreign investors, reflected in Fig. 1, is partly due to regulatory changes during the period. Before 1993, most Swedish firms had two classes of equity, restricted and unrestricted shares. Only the latter could be held by foreigners. The proportion of unrestricted shares was limited by law to $20\\%$ of the voting rights and $40\\%$ of the equity. The restrictions were formally abolished in January 1993, but many firms were already allowed to convert their restricted shares to unrestricted shares in 1992.  \n\nThe fuctuating line illustrates Sweden's weight in Financial Times/Standard & Poor's World Market Index at the end of each quarter. This index only includes stocks that can be bought by foreign investors. Although Sweden's weight in the world index increased by a factor of four in this period, foreign investments grew more than 15 times. Hence, the increased share of foreign ownership in Swedish stocks cannot be explained by investors simply following the world market index.  \n\n![](images/0ccbc756401009e8e56ced033fda773e6aa48a96d1bb6ee0ebdfb5d1deec12d2.jpg)  \nFig. 1. Foreign ownership on the Swedish stock market. The figure shows foreign ownership in Sweden on a year-by-year basis over the period 1991-1997. The bars depict the total market capitalization of the Swedish stock market as well as foreign ownership in the Swedish market; both of these measures are reflected on the left scale. The market value and foreign ownership are expressed in terms of SEK billion. The numbers above the white bars represent the number of firms while those above the cross-hatched bars show the number of firms, with positive foreign ownership. The fuctuating line in the figure shows quarterly observations of Sweden's weight in the world market, reflected on the right scale.  \n\nOne potential problem with our measure of foreign ownership is that no information is available on foreigners’ use of Swedish-registered investment vehicles. Similarly, we have only limited knowledge of the use of foreign investment vehicles among Swedes. Since we only have access to data on direct ownership in firms we cannot, for instance, discriminate between a domestic and a foreign investor investing in a Swedish mutual fund. If foreigners invest in Swedish mutual funds, we underestimate true foreign ownership. However, the foreign ownership that we cannot observe only affects the results if it is tilted toward investments in specific firms. For the same reason, we can overestimate foreign ownership if Swedes invest domestically through firms located outside Sweden. However, we have quantified the use of foreign investment vehicles among the major Swedish owners and corrected for this in our ownership data. As an example, the Swedish Spendrup family controls the Spendrup brewery through a Dutch foundation. Technically speaking, this holding constitutes foreign ownership, but we have classified it as a holding by a Swedish investor.  \n\nWe have classified the firms into nine industries using the codes provided by Affarsvarlden. Table 1 provides a summary of foreign ownership for each industry at the end of 1997. The first two columns present the number and the market capitalization of the firms in different industries. The largest industry category by far is Engineering. It accounts for about $39\\%$ of the total market capitalization in our sample. The second and third largest industries are Financials, and Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, at about $14\\%$ and $13\\%$ , respectively. Shipping is clearly the smallest industry. Columns three and four report foreign ownership. Engineering is also the largest industry in the portfolio held by foreign investors. Almost $45\\%$ of their portfolio consists of Engineering firms, and thus they have a $15\\%$ overweight in the portfolio. Foreigners are also overweighted in Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, and in the Pulp and Paper industry. It appears that foreign investors are not keen on construction firms in Sweden, since they have an underweight of about $50\\%$ . One reason for this phenomenon could be that Construction is typically a local business and, as a consequence, foreign investors know little about the firms in this industry. It is also clear that foreigners are underweighted in Retail and Consumer Goods, and Miscellaneous. Our study of the portfolio of foreign investors over time shows that the portfolio mix has been fairly stable during the sample period. The only exceptions are that foreigners were systematically underweighted in Pulp and Paper until 1996, and that the position in Financials was disproportionately high in 1991 and 1992.  \n\nThe last two columns of the table present the equally weighted and valueweighted averages of foreign ownership. These columns illustrate an important characteristic of the data. The equally weighted average is computed by taking the percentage of shares owned by foreigners for each firm and then averaging this percentage across firms. This average ranges from $13.3\\%$ for Construction to $28.6\\%$ for Financials. When calculating the value-weighted averages, we simply summarize the market value of all shares held by foreign investors and divide this number by the total market capitalization of the firms. As seen in the table, the value-weighted average is always larger than its equally weighted counterpart. This pattern indicates that foreign investors seem to hold disproportionately more shares in large firms in terms of market value. We also checked this feature of the data for the period 1991-1996, and found the same pattern in each year. Hence, the preference for large firms seems to be robust both over time and over industries.  \n\nws q  ys ums o uod u   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Weighted averages of foreign ownership</td><td>Value</td><td>37.2</td><td>35.3 28.2 (8.9)</td><td>23.3 19.2 26.7 37 114.7 3</td><td>16.6 13.3</td><td>27.8</td><td>30.3</td><td></td><td>37.5 19.6</td><td>30.6 20.4</td><td>20.9 18.6</td><td>32.4 19.7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Equal</td><td>20.0 (44.8)</td><td></td><td></td><td>22.2</td><td>28.6 (13.5)</td><td></td><td>28.9</td><td></td><td></td><td>(100.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"7\">foreign ownership Firms with Firms in industry</td><td>MCAP (% uI)</td><td>310.2</td><td>61.8 (100.0) 13</td><td>3 (100.0) (96.9) 31</td><td>3.</td><td>93.6 10</td><td>106.1 20</td><td>(15.3)</td><td>(4.2)</td><td>41.9 (6.1)</td><td>691.8</td></tr><tr><td>(% I) N MCAP (% u)</td><td>(100.0) 50 832.9 (39.0)</td><td>175.9 (8.2) (5.4)</td><td>113.4 (5.3)</td><td>(100.0) 12 (0.6)</td><td>(6:06) 309.0 (14.5)</td><td>(100.0) 283.2 (13.3)</td><td>(100.0) 43 (4.4)</td><td>64 200.5</td><td>(100.0)</td><td>(99.3) 280 2136.4 (100.0)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>94.4 3</td><td>9</td><td>(9.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Z</td><td>S</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td rowspan=\"2\">282</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td>Engineering</td><td> Paper and Pulp</td><td>Retail and Consumer Goods</td><td></td><td></td><td>Chemical and Pharmaceutical</td><td></td><td>IT and Services</td><td>Miscellaneous</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### 3.2. Firm characteristics  \n\nIn this subsection, we briefly describe a number of firm-specific attributes used in the empirical analysis. To enable easy comparison, we first choose essentially the same attributes as Kang and Stulz (1997). These are:  \n\n(i) Size: This variable is the market capitalization of the firm at the year-end. In the regressions, we consider the log of the market capitalization. (i) Dividend yield: The value of all dividends paid during the year divided by the market value of the firm at year-end. (ii) Return: The yearly return on the shares of the firm is calculated as the cumulative compounded return using the 52 weekly returns preceding the year-end. For firms with a shorter listing history than 52 weeks, the data set contains a missing value. (iv) Systematic risk: Systematic risk is the beta coefficient for the market model, estimated using the weekly returns. The market portfolio is the value-weighted portfolio in our sample. (v) Idiosyncratic risk: This variable measures the residual variance in the market model regression using weekly returns. (vi) Book-to-market: This is a valuation measure of the firm. \"Growth firms\" typically have low book-to-market ratios, while firms with higher ratios are referred to as “value firms\". The ratio is defined as the book value of equity divided by the market value of equity at year-end. (vi) Current ratio: We use this as a proxy for short-term financial distress. It is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities at year-end, and measures the ability of the firm to meet its short-term payment requirements. (vi) Leverage ratio: This is a measure of long-term financial distress. It is defined as the ratio of total liabilities to total equity at year-end. (ix) Return on equity: Return on equity is measured as net income divided by the book value of equity at year-end. As mentioned above, we use firm size as a first proxy for how well-known a firm is abroad. When we further analyze the preference for large firms, we consider alternative variables that proxy for firm recognition and investor influence. These variables are: (x) Export rate: Firms with large sales abroad are more likely to be familiar to foreign investors. The export rate is measured as export sales divided by total sales. (xi) Turnover rate: This rate is a measure of the market liquidity of the firm's shares. It is defined as the total value of stocks traded over a year divided by the market value of the firm.  \n\n(xii) Concentration: This measure of ownership concentration is defined as the proportion of votes held by the largest shareholder coalition. (xii) Foreign listing: This dummy variable takes a value of one if the firm's shares are listed abroad. Otherwise, the value is zero.  \n\nStockholm Information Exchange (SIX) provided the data for variables (i)-(xi), while (xi) and (xiii) are from SIS Agarservice and Stockholm Stock Exchange, respectively.3  \n\n## 4. Empirical results  \n\nIn this section, we present evidence of foreign ownership in Sweden. We begin by showing the relation between foreign ownership and the different firm characteristics used by Kang and Stulz (1997). We then deepen our understanding of the determinants of foreign ownership by introducing further variables that serve as proxies for firm recognition and investor influence. Next, we demonstrate that most features associated with foreign ownership are driven by the fact that foreign investments are typically made by institutional investors or mutual funds, rather than by foreign individual investors. Finally, we consider geographic aspects of foreign holdings.  \n\n### 4.1. Aggregated foreign ownership and firm characteristics  \n\n#### 4.1.1. A baseline estimation  \n\nTo illustrate the binary relations between foreign ownership and firm characteristics, we first construct portfolios based on firm characteristics presented in the previous section, excluding the variations on size, variables (x) and (xi). Specifically, all firms listed at the end of 1997 are ranked according to their characteristics and sorted into quintiles. In Table 2 we report the average of the characteristic and the foreign ownership for each quintile. The first ranking in the table illustrates a strong positive relation between foreign ownership and the size of a firm, measured as market capitalization. In the quintile of the smallest firms (Q1), the average market value is about SEK 110 million, and foreign ownership, measured as an equally weighted average, is $10\\%$ . However, in the quintile of the largest firms (Q5), the average market value is SEK 34 billion, and foreign ownership is almost $30\\%$ . The bias in favor of large firms supports our earlier findings. Moreover, foreign investors own a larger share in firms with low book-to-market ratios and low dividend yields. In other words, foreigners seem to like growth stocks. Recall, however, that our grouping procedure only allows aThe table shows the ranking of firms based on characteristics for 1997. Firms are ranked according to a characteristic, sorted into quintiles, and averages of foreign ownership and the characteristics within each quintile are reported. The five quintiles are labeled Q1 (low) to Q5 (high). Average refers to the equally weighted average of foreign ownership and the characteristics. $N$ isthe total number of observations used in the ranking. Foreign ownership is expressed as a percentage of the capitalization of the firm. Market capitalization is expressed in SEK billion.

Residual variance is the variance of the error term from the market model regression. Book-to-market ratio is defined as the book value of equity divided by the market value of equity at year-end.

Since book-to-market ratios and dividend yields by construction, are likely to be negatively correlated with size, the apparent preference of foreigners for growth stocks may be spurious, and driven by a preference for large firms. It is also noteworthy that foreign ownership is lower in firms with high idiosyncratic risk, and, to some extent, in firms with high leverage. The results from the ranking portfolios are similar to those obtained either by using median values, instead of averages, or by sorting according to ownership instead of the firm characteristics. Furthermore, the results are similar for each year of the sample period.  \n\nTo analyze the above relations while controlling for the other characteristics, we run multivariate regressions of foreign ownership on the firm characteristics. The estimations are carried out on a year-by-year basis from 1993 to 1997, as well as in a pooled regression. We exclude 1991 and 1992 from our regressions since the restriction on foreign investments were still in place in many of the firms during these years. Let $\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{F}}$ and $\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathbf{M}}$ denote the weights of firm i in year $t$ in the portfolio of foreign investors and the market portfolio, respectively. In the regressions, we characterize foreigners' holdings relative to the market portfolio, and employ $y_{i t}=\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{F}}/\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{M}}-1$ as the dependent variable. Note that the ratio of foreign investors portfolio weight in firm $i$ to the weight of firm $i$ in the market portfolio is equivalent to the ratio of the foreign ownership in firm $i$ to the value-weighted average of foreign ownership. A positive $y_{i t}$ implies that foreigners invest disproportionately more in firm $i$ relative to the market portfolio, while negative values of $y_{i t}$ imply that foreigners invest less in firms relative to the market portfolio. The regressions are given by  \n\n$$\ny_{i t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta^{\\prime}x_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $x_{i t}$ is a vector of firm characteristics associated with firm $i$ in year $t,\\beta$ is a vector of parameters, $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ is an error term, and fixed year effects are represented in the intercept $\\alpha_{t}$  \n\nThe regression results are reported in Table 3, where constants and fixed effects are not shown. The positive relation between foreign ownership, size, as measured by the log of market capitalization, and current ratio, and the negative relation between dividend yields and foreign ownership, are apparent. The regressions for each year reveal that foreigners invested significantly more in large firms, in firms with more cash, and in firms with relatively low dividends. In the pooled regression, there also appears to be a negative relation between foreign ownership and the book-to-market and leverage ratios. However, in the individual years, these results are only statistically significant in a few cases.  \n\nIn the pooled regression, the estimated current ratio coefficient is about 7, meaning that a unit increase of the current ratio, all else held equal, is related to $7\\%$ higher foreign ownership. The coefficient for the logged market capitalization is about 15. That is, foreign ownership in a firm with a market value approximately 2.7, or $e$ times, larger than an otherwise identical firm is on average $15\\%$ higher. Since the magnitude of cross-sectional variability of logged size and current ratio is almost identical (not reported), firm size contributes to about twice the variability in foreign ownership compared with the current ratio, and is clearly the most important determinant of foreign ownership among all the attributes.  \n\nTable3 Regressions of foreign ownership on characteristicsa   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>1993</td><td>1994</td><td>1995</td><td>1996</td><td>1997</td><td>Pooled</td></tr><tr><td>Market capitalization</td><td>15.80 (3.14)</td><td>17.48 (2.52)</td><td>13.23 (2.61)</td><td>15.90 (2.68)</td><td>16.47 (2.76)</td><td>14.57 (1.17)</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend yield</td><td>-16.28 (4.24)</td><td>- 9.29 (3.09)</td><td>-3.94 (1.98)</td><td>- 4.29 (1.60)</td><td>-1.88 (0.97)</td><td>- 4.30 (0.90)</td></tr><tr><td>Return</td><td>- 0.01 (0.05)</td><td>- 0.06 (0.14)</td><td>- 0.19 (0.16)</td><td>- 0.06 (0.11)</td><td>- 0.22 (0.08)</td><td>- 0.01 (0.04)</td></tr><tr><td>Beta</td><td>-3.66 (7.74)</td><td>-26.98 (12.68)</td><td>-3.63 (12.04)</td><td>- 1.42 (12.04)</td><td>36.19 (13.33)</td><td>-7.45 (5.04)</td></tr><tr><td>Residual variance</td><td>- 4.06 (5.38)</td><td>19.88 (45.01)</td><td>42.82 (25.88)</td><td>-21.60 (16.50)</td><td>-16.88 (26.74)</td><td>2.49 (5.82)</td></tr><tr><td>Book-to-market ratio</td><td>-5.85 (14.2)</td><td>-8.22 (5.70)</td><td>-31.94 (12.80)</td><td>- 15.14 (12.31)</td><td>-14.62 (10.46)</td><td>-12.45 (4.81)</td></tr><tr><td>Current ratio</td><td>8.92 (5.03)</td><td>17.17 (4.49)</td><td>9.45 (2.88)</td><td>8.58 (2.86)</td><td>5.90 (1.91)</td><td>7.48 (1.53)</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage ratio</td><td>-1.36 (1.30)</td><td>- 1.05 (1.42)</td><td>-3.42 (2.27)</td><td>-3.64 (3.26)</td><td>- 0.41 (2.59)</td><td>-1.82 (0.75)</td></tr><tr><td>Return on equity</td><td>0.12 (0.12)</td><td>- 0.00 (0.23)</td><td>0.31 (0.31)</td><td>- 0.37 (0.19)</td><td>- 0.21 (0.12)</td><td>- 0.08 (0.09)</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R2</td><td>15.59 [0.00]</td><td>26.68 [0.00]</td><td>20.87 [0.00]</td><td>22.16 [0.00]</td><td>18.39 [0.00]</td><td>20.05 [0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>154</td><td>161</td><td>184</td><td>184</td><td>185</td><td>868</td></tr><tr><td>No</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>14</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\na The table shows the results of multiple regressions of foreign ownership on firm characteristics on a year-by-year basis, as well as on data pooled over the years from 1993 to 1997.

These estimations support our main result, uncovering the positive relation between foreign ownership, firm size, and the current ratio, and the negative relation between foreign ownership and dividend yields. The weak negative relation between foreign ownership and the book-to-market ratio seems to be related to a tendency for foreigners to underweight construction firms, since the average book-to-market ratio for construction firms is almost twice as high as that of the aggregate market.  \n\nWe also checked whether our results are affected by outliers in the dependent variable, that is, by firms with zero weights or heavily overweighted firms. Since we are effectively considering a truncated distribution of ownership, the appropriate regression model is a censored regression model, a Tobit model. To limit the impact of highly overweighted firms, we also considered a log transformation of the ratio of portfolio weights as the dependent variable, that is, $y_{i t}=\\ln(1+\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{F}}/\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{M}}).$ The estimated model is thus  \n\n$$\ny_{i t}^{\\star}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta^{\\prime}x_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{i t}=0$ $y_{i t}^{\\star}\\leqslant0$ and $y_{i t}=y_{i t}^{\\star}$ if $y_{i t}^{\\star}>0$ . The results confirm that foreigners hold a disproportionately large part of their portfolio in large firms, in firms with a high current ratio, and in firms paying low dividends.  \n\nThe preference for firms paying low dividends can be motivated by the tax advantage foreign investors may face with regard to the trade-off between capital gains and dividends. In many countries, this case holds, at least for long-term holdings. If foreign investors typically find themselves less informed about frms than domestic investors, they may prefer firms with high current ratios since this is an objective and easily measurable quantity that carries information about the financial strength of a firm. The bias toward large firms has a number of potential explanations since size can be a proxy for many preferred firm attributes. Thus, in the following subsection, we further characterize foreign ownership and analyze why firm size is a preferred characteristic among foreign investors. More specifically, we test hypotheses based on the conjecture that size is a proxy for firm recognition.  \n\n#### 4.1.2. Firm recognition and investor infuence  \n\nWhy do foreign investors like large firms? Could it be that large firms are better known, or are other features, such as the market liquidity of the shares, more important? Merton (1987) and Huberman (1999) argue that investors simply prefer firms with which they are familiar, and which they may have more knowledge about. A starting point for our analysis would then be to consider firms that are frequently covered by analysts and media. These firms are likely to be the largest firms in the financial market. An alternative way to recognize a firm is through global markets. Thus, an investor may be more willing to invest in well-known exporting firms, and firms that are listed on foreign exchanges. Furthermore, Tesar and Werner (1995) document that foreign investors trade more than their colleagues investing in domestic markets. This trading pattern demands high market liquidity of the firm's shares. Finally, we consider a measure of ownership concentration as a regressor, to gauge the importance of investor influence among foreign investors.  \n\nThe results from pooled regressions are presented in Table 4. One obstacle that arises when relating the results from these regressions with earlier findings is that we have far fewer observations on the new variables. To limit the impact of this problem and enable comparisons, we re-ran the regressions of foreign ownership on size, dividend yield, book-to-market ratio, and current ratio, which are the most significant variables from the full regressions, on the subset for which we have data for the new variables. Since export rate is the variable with the smallest number of observations, we consider regressions with and without export rate as a regressor.  \n\nSize is still significant in most regressions. The current ratio and dividend yield display a significant relation to foreign ownership over all regressions, and the magnitudes of the coefficients are unaffected by the inclusion of new variables. Foreigners seem to have a strong preference for firms with high exports and turnover. Moreover, ownership concentration enters the equation significantly with a negative sign, implying that foreigners avoid firms with a dominant owner. In other words, they seem to attach considerable importance to their influence in the firm. Finally, foreign investors tend to hold firms listed on other international stock exchanges. These variables together seem to diminish the size effect. In the regression where all attributes are included, size exhibits no significant relation to foreign ownership. We also added a dummy variable for the firms listed on the A-list of the Stockholm Stock Exchange. These firms meet the most stringent requirements with respect to verifiable history, free float of equity, number of shareholders, among other criteria. However, the coefficient was insignificant and close to zero in all regressions. In the regression from which the export rate is excluded the additional attributes, including turnover, concentration, and foreign listing, are still significant, both individually and jointly.  \n\nTo sum up, foreign investors seem to prefer firms with the most liquid stocks, firms with large exports, firms with low ownership concentration where shares are widely held, and firms that are listed abroad. The overall evidence is consistent with the conjecture that informational asymmetries may be the driving force behind the biases in foreigners' holdings. Below, however, we will document similar deviations from the market portfolio for domestic institutional investors.  \n\n### 4.2. Foreign ownership versus domestic investor categories  \n\nWe have seen that foreign investors deviate from holding the market portfolio, and that they tend to prefer firms with certain attributes. As stated earlier, the representative foreign investor is an institutional investor. Ideally, we would then like to construct a domestic benchmark investor with characteristics as similar as possible to those of the typical foreign investor. This construction would enable us to compare two groups of investors, foreign and domestic. In addition to analyzing deviations from the market portfolio, we use information from various domestic investor categories and contrast the properties of their portfolios with those of foreigners? portfolios.  \n\nd   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>#</td><td>10.87 (1.48) -3.81 (0.86) 12.68 (4.79)</td><td>8.27 (1.43)</td><td>21.57 (5.13) 32.21 (9.61) 27.20 (8.53) 26.61 [0.00]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>10.39 (1.46) 4.22 (0.89) -14.87 (5.05)</td><td>8.95 (1.42)</td><td>29.60 (8.54) 23.20 [0.00] 841</td></tr><tr><td>(ix)</td><td>12.65 (1.03) 4.27 (0.87) 15.17</td><td>(5.22) 8.76 (1.42)</td><td>44.43 (9.86) 23.90 [0.00] 841 —</td></tr><tr><td>(viii)</td><td>15.40 (1.05) 3.97 (0.84) 12.23 一</td><td>(4.81) 8.90 (1.41) 27.82</td><td>(5.14) 24.38 [0.00] 841</td></tr><tr><td>(vii)</td><td>13.93 (1.02) 4.39 (0.87)</td><td>15.13 (5.18) 9.30 (1.40)</td><td>21.78 [0.00] 841</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>4.59 (3.17) 3.95 (2.16)</td><td>34.52 (13.25) 11.02 (2.97) 22.40 (15.28) 32.05</td><td>(10.68) 57.52 (14.24) 37.17 (12.84) 29.25 [0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>E</td><td>5.60 (2.91) 4.84 (2.00)</td><td>- 44.76 (12.11) 10.96 (3.14)</td><td>45.61 (12.61) 22.08 [0.00]</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>11.08 (1.99) 4.46 (1.95) 37.58</td><td>(12.23) 15.06 (2.38)</td><td>-76.05 (14.81) 23.52 [0.00]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15.30 (1.73) 3.16 (2.04) 37.87</td><td>(12.64) 13.39 (2.70) 46.32 (10.58)</td><td>22.27 [0.00] 317</td></tr><tr><td>E</td><td>11.01 (2.06) 5.47 (2.12)</td><td>-35.73 (12.80) 10.79 (3.02) 38.46 (14.68)</td><td>18.88 [0.00] 317</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>13.72 (1.73) 4.74 (2.01) 41.93</td><td>(12.44) 13.47 (2.59)</td><td>17.73 [0.00] 317</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Market capitalization Book-to-market ratio Dividend yield</td><td>Turnover rate Current ratio Export rate</td><td>Concentration Foreign listing Adjusted R2 Z</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nAn examination of foreign investors reveals that the representative foreign investor is a large institution.4 These institutions can, in turn, be divided into industrial investors and portfolio investors. Investors in the first group typically have a few large holdings, while investors in the second group hold diversified portfolios. We have access to three aggregates of domestic investors for 1997: mutual funds, other institutional investors, and individuals. We focus on the holdings of the institutional investor categories and use them as domestic benchmarks investors. To complete the picture, we also present results for individual investors.  \n\nA first analysis of domestic benchmark holdings in different industries (not reported) shows that domestic institutional investors also hold a disproportionate share of ownership overweighted in Engineering firms. A striking difference, however, is that domestic institutional investors overweight their positions in Construction. The fact that Construction firms are typically local businesses, and therefore likely to be less well-known to foreigners, may explain this difference. An interesting property of domestic institutional ownership is that the value-weighted average of the ownership exceeds the equally weighted counterpart in each industry. This finding indicates that domestic institutional investors also have a disproportionately higher ownership in large firms. Hence, our finding that foreigners prefer large firms may be spurious and driven by the fact that the typical foreigner is a large institutional investor. To check this finding, we begin by running a regression of the holdings by domestic investor categories on the firm characteristics. The model specification is identical to that of Eq. (1), with the exception that the dependent variable is now $y_{i t}=\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathbf{D}}/\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathbf{M}}-1$ ,where $\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{D}}$ is the weight of firm $i$ in year $t$ in the portfolio of the domestic benchmark investor.  \n\nThe regression results are presented in Table 5. To enable easy comparison, the table also reports the coefficients for foreign ownership. Foreign ownership in 1997 is positively related to size and the current ratio, and negatively related to systematic risk. The regression results also demonstrate that the holdings of domestic mutual funds and other institutional investors are also significantly positively related to the size of the firm. In this year, we find that foreigners and institutional investors invest less in firms with low past returns. However, we find some differences between foreign holdings and those of large domestic institutions. The main differences are that foreigners prefer firms with high current ratios, and that domestic institutions invest relatively more in firms with aThe table reports the results of multiple regressions of ownership, by category, on characteristics for 1997.

The latter result suggests that domestic investors seem to more distinctly avoid the most risky firms, as compared to foreign investors.? The holdings of all large investor categories are negatively related to ownership concentration, but not always significantly so. Finally, all investor categories deviate from holding the market portfolio as indicated by the $p$ -values from Wald tests of overall significance. The $R^{2}$ for the regressions are about $21\\%$ $15\\%$ ,and $31\\%$ for the foreign ownership, mutual fund ownership, and institutional ownership, respectively.  \n\nThe table also presents the results for individual investors. As this category is residual, we can expect the results to mirror those of the other investor categories. The main result is that individual investors, compared with the market, seem to underweight large firms and firms with high current ratios and low turnover. Instead, they overweight firms with high ownership concentration. Note that, in many small firms, an individual person is the dominating owner. With regard to the attributes capturing risk and return, we see that a pattern emerges. Individual investors show a preference for firms that have high past returns, and overweight firms with relatively high risk, both systematic and idiosyncratic.  \n\nThe results for domestic mutual funds and institutional investors can be compared and contrasted with those found in other studies. Falkenstein (1996) finds that U.S. mutual funds have a significant preference for stocks with high visibility, as measured by coverage in newspaper articles. In particular, funds show an aversion to small firms. Gompers and Metrick (1999) show that large institutions, compared with other investors, prefer to invest in large, liquid stocks that have low past returns. Hence, our results support previous evidence on the holdings of institutional investors.  \n\nWhen comparing the regression result for foreign and large domestic investors, we find, in some cases, that the sign of the coefficients differs across the two regressions. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the parameter estimates. It appears that the main difference between foreign and domestic institutional investors, with respect to their preference for certain firm characteristics, is that foreigners like cash whereas domestic institutions underweight firms with high idiosyncratic risk. We also see that domestic institutions put less emphasis on firms with high turnover. To formally test whether this is true, we regress the difference of the portfolio mixes for foreign and domestic investors on the firm characterstics. We run Eq. (1) again, now using $y_{i t}=\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{F}}/\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{M}}-\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{D}}/\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{M}}$ as the dependent variable.An alternative specification would be to let $y_{i t}=\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{F}}/\\omega_{i t}^{\\mathrm{D}}-1$ , that is, to study the direct ratio between the foreign and domestic portfolio weights. However, this specification introduces a problem when the domestic weights, recorded in the denominator, are equal to zero.  \n\nThe results are shown in Table 6. As expected, the coefficients are equal to the difference between the coefficients in Table 5, but the standard errors allow us to test the equality of the difference in holdings. The most significant coefficients, as compared to the domestic institutional investors, are those that are associated with turnover and foreign listings. These estimates reveal that the main difference between foreign and domestic benchmark investors is that domestic investors hold less in firms with high turnover, and that foreigners have a preference a The table reports the results of multiple regressions of foreign ownership versus other ownership categories on characteristics for 1997.

The latter result supports our conjecture that asymmetric information may be an important factor when explaining why foreign investors deviate from holding the market portfolio.  \n\nWe also see some evidence that foreigners have a preference for firms with large cash positions and firms paying small dividends. As previously argued, the preference of foreign investors for firms paying low dividends can be explained by tax advantages in foreign jurisdictions for capital gains to dividends income. In Sweden, both forms of income are taxed at the same level. The bias displayed by foreign investors towards firms with large cash positions on their balance sheets can be understood in terms of asymmetric information, that is, foreigners appreciate firms with a high objective measure of financial strength.  \n\nInterestingly, the size effect seems to be common to all three institutional investor categories. While these three categories are fairly similar, the significant differences among investors are to be found when comparing them with individual investors. The latter show a much stronger preference for small and risky firms with high past returns. In addition, these investors do not avoid firms with dominant owners. The similarities between the three large institutional investor categories and how they differ from individual investors are confirmed by the $R^{2}$ of the regressions. The $R^{2}$ in the regression of foreign versus individual holdings is as high as $51\\%$ , whereas the $R^{2}$ for mutual funds and institutions are only about $7-9\\%$  \n\n### 4.3. Disaggregated foreign ownership and geographic structure  \n\nIn the previous analysis, we found that exports might serve as a proxy for firm recognition in global markets. This finding implies that investors from countries where Swedish firms have large sales potentially know more about the frms compared with investors from other countries. Traditionally, Swedish firms have large exports to the Nordic countries, and to several other European countries. In general, export sales seem to be negatively related to the geographic distance between Sweden and a particular country. In this subsection, we informally explore a corresponding relation between foreign ownership and the geographic distance to the investor.  \n\nIn addition to the aggregate foreign ownership data, we have access to ownership data at a country level for 1997. The exact distribution of foreign ownership is given in Table 7, which shows that foreign ownership is highly concentrated to a few countries where investors from the U.s., followed by those from the U.K., dominate.  \n\nIn Table 8 we present statistics on foreign ownership by geographic regions. Investors from North America account for about half the total foreign ownership. The market value of their portfolio is SEK 338 billion. The portfolio of European investors is of the same magnitude with a market capitalization of SEK 283 billion, and the Nordic investors essentially make up the rest of the investment pool. It is noteworthy that for all regions, except the Nordic countries, the value-weighted average of foreign ownership is larger than the equally weighted average. This finding is particularly interesting given Sweden's aThe table shows the results of multiple regressions of regional foreign ownership on characteristics for 1997.

This result is in a sense related to Coval and Moskowitz (1999) who find that the closer the investment, the less evident the preference for large firms becomes. We further investigate deviations from the market portfolio in a regression framework in which foreign ownership for separate regions is employed as a dependent variable.  \n\nThe results from the regressions of foreign ownership for geographic regions are presented in Table 9. The regressions are not undertaken for the Far East and Other categories as they include too few observations of positive foreign ownership. Investors from Europe and North America seem to prefer large firms, and firms with large cash holdings. The preference for large firms is significant for European and, especially, North American investors. Since the average size of the U.s. investors is, by far, the largest among all foreign investors in our sample, this result is not surprising given our finding that the preference for large firms is effectively an institutional investor bias. It is also noteworthy that investors from Europe and North America show a small, insignificant preference for firms with high market liquidity, while the holdings of Nordic investors are negatively related to turnover. The relation to ownership concentration is negative for all regions, but only marginally significant in the World regression.  \n\nRegarding the overall significance, the regressions reveal that the results are largely driven by North American, or principally U.S., ownership. Indeed, the $R^{2}$ for North America is about $30\\%$ , which can be compared to $6\\%$ for Europe. Interestingly, the holdings of Nordic investors do not significantly deviate from the market portfolio as indicated by the $p$ -value from a Wald test of the overall significance (the $R^{2}$ is less than $1\\%$  \n\n## 5. Conclusion  \n\nBy using a rich dataset on equity ownership and firm-specific attributes, we are able to characterize foreign ownership in Swedish firms in great detail. We find that foreign investors allocate a disproportionately high share of their funds to large firms. Further, foreign investors seem to prefer firms with large cash positions on their balance sheet and firms that pay low dividends. Further, we attempt to understand why foreign investors prefer large firms, as size may be a proxy for many underlying sources, including firm recognition. We find that market liquidity seems to be an important driving force for this preference. The evidence also suggests that foreign ownership is related to firms presence in the international markets, either through export sales or listings on other exchanges. Moreover, foreign investors seem to prefer firms with a widespread ownership, a characteristic which again is most likely to be fulfilled by large firms. The unique dataset that we have utilized has enabled us to compare and contrast foreign ownership with other domestic investor categories. We hence investigate whether the preference for large firms is a pure foreigner bias by relating foreign ownership to that of domestic mutual funds and other institutional investors. Interestingly, these investor groups display similar portfolio preferences as compared to foreign investors. This finding leads us to conclude that the preference for large firms is common to all institutional investors. Finally, our analysis of foreign ownership on a regional level indicates that the results seem to be driven by the holdings of large U.s. investors.  \n\nIn this paper, we have focused on the characterization of foreign ownership and how it relates to institutional ownership. Further issues that are worth exploring include how foreigners have performed relative to the general market, what determines foreigners’ purchases and sales of shares, and how fows are related to returns. We hope to be able to address these issues in the near future.  \n\n# References  \n\nAdler, M., Dumas, B., 1983. International portfolio choice and corporation finance: a synthesis.

To evaluate these claims, we construct and analyze a new dataset that covers U.S. buyouts from 1980 to 2005. We track 3,200 target firms and their 150,000 establishments before and after acquisition, comparing them to controls defined by industry, size, age, and prior growth. Relative to controls, employment at target establishments falls 3 percent over two years post buyout and 6 percent over five years. However, target firms also create more new jobs at new establishments, and they acquire and divest establishments more rapidly. Considering all adjustment margins, relative net job loss at target firms is a modest one percent of employment over two years post buyout. In contrast, the sum of gross job creation and destruction at target firms exceeds that of controls by 14 percent of employment over two years. Buyouts also bring TFP gains at target firms and reductions in earnings per worker. Productivity gains arise mainly from an accelerated exit of less productive establishments and greater entry of more productive ones - that is, from a directed reallocation of jobs within target firms.  \n\nSteven J.

Introduction  \n\nLeveraged buyouts by private equity firms arouse intense concern and strongly held views. For instance, former Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen - architect of the European Commission's Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive - contends that \"leveraged buyouts’ leave the company saddled with debt and interest payments, its workers are laid off, and its assets are sold, ... benefiting neither workers nor the real economy\" The Service Employees International Union, prominent critic of private equity on both sides of the Atlantic, offers this assessment: “Typically it's easier to decrease costs quickly by cutting heads, which is why buyouts have typically been accompanied by layoffs.\"1 Responding to similar contentions, several industry-sponsored studies claim positive employment and other effects of private equity. Examples include European Venture Capital Association (2005), British Venture Capital Association (2006), A.T. Kearney (2007), and Shapiro and Pham (2008).  \n\nEfforts to bring data to these issues are highly welcome, but these studies have serious limitations. First, they rely on surveys with incomplete and perhaps selective responses, raising doubts about representativeness and accuracy. Second, the underlying data offer little scope to control for concurrent changes at comparable firms. When a firm backed by private equity sheds $5\\%$ of employment, the interpretation depends greatly on whether comparable firms grow by $3\\%$ Or shrink by $10\\%$ . Third, these studies do not distinguish cleanly between changes at firms backed by venture capital and firms backed by other forms of private equity. Both are interesting, but the controversy involves buyouts, not venture capital. Fourth, these studies face major challenges in measuring organic job growth because they lack establishment-level data. As a result, it is hard to disentangle organic changes from the acquisition and sale of particular facilities and business units. Fifth, the lack of establishment-level data also precludes a breakdown of firm-level employment changes into job creation and job destruction components, i.e., gains and losses at the establishment level. As we show, private equity buyouts have quite different effects on these two margins of employment change.  \n\nIn this study, we construct and analyse a dataset that overcomes these limitations and, at the same time, encompasses a much larger set of private equity buyouts and controls. We rely on the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) at the U.S. Census Bureau to track employment and earnings before and after buyouts at firms and establishments - i.e., specific factories, offices, retail outlets and other distinct physical locations where business takes place. The LBD covers the entire nonfarm private sector and contains annual data for about 5 million firms and 6 million establishments. To obtain high-quality productivity measures, we turn to the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) and the Census of Manufactures (CM). In addition to their other strengths, the establishment-level information in the LBD, ASM and CM enables us to explore important aspects of within-firm restructuring activity in the wake of private equity buyouts.  \n\nWe combine the LBD, ASM and CM with data from CapitalIQ and other sources to identify and characterize private equity transactions. The resulting matched sample contains about 3,200 U.S. firms acquired in buyouts from 1980 to 2005 (\"target firms\") and 150,000 U.S. establishments operated by these firms as of the buyout year (\\*\"target establishments\"). We match each target firm to other firms that are comparable in terms of industry, age, size, and single/multi-establishment status, and then follow targets and matched controls over time. We take a similar approach to controls for target establishments.  \n\nTo clarify the scope of our study, we consider later-stage changes in ownership and control executed and partly financed by private equity firms. In these transactions, the (lead) private equity firm acquires a controlling stake in the target firm and retains a significant oversight role until it “exits\" by selling its stake. The buyout event typically involves a shift toward greater leverage in the capital structure of the target firm and, sometimes, a change in its management. We exclude management-led buyouts that do not involve acquisition by a private equity firm. We also exclude startup firms backed by venture capitalists.  \n\nOur establishment-level analysis yields three main findings: First, employment shrinks more rapidly, on average, at target establishments than at controls after private equity buyouts. The average cumulative difference in favor of controls is about $3\\%$ of initial employment over two years and $6\\%$ over five years. Second, the larger post-buyout employment losses at target establishments entirely reflect higher rates of job destruction at shrinking and exiting establishments. In fact, targets exhibit greater post-buyout creation of new jobs at expanding establishments. Adding controls for pre-buyout growth history shrinks the estimated employment responses to private equity buyouts but does not change the overall pattern. Third, earnings per worker at continuing target establishments fall by an average of $2.4\\%$ relative to controls over two years post buyout.  \n\nThe establishment-level analysis misses job creation at newly opened establishments, whether by target or control firms. To capture this activity, we move to a firm-level analysis and identify new establishments opened post buyout. The combination of firm and establishment data in the LBD is what enables us to isolate and quantify “greenfield\" job creation at facilities opened post buyout. For this part of our analysis, we shorten the time window to two years post buyout. Lengthening the window involves a greater incidence and complexity of ownership changes, threatening the integrity of our firm-level longitudinal linkages or forcing us to narrow the sample. We find that target firms engage in more greenfield job creation than control firms, with a cumulative two-year difference of nearly $2\\%$ of initial employment. That is, greater greenfield job creation partly offsets the relative employment drop at target establishments. Our firm-level analysis also yields another interesting result: Private equity targets engage in more acquisitions and more divestitures than controls. Summing over job creation and destruction at continuing establishments, job losses at shuttered establishments, job gains at greenfield establishments, and contributions of acquisitions and divestitures, employment shrinks by less than $1\\%$ at target firms relative to controls in the first two years after private equity buyouts.  \n\nWe uncover a much larger response in the pace of job reallocation. Specifically, over the first two years post buyout, establishment-level job gains and losses at target firms exceed gains and losses at controls by $14\\%$ of initial employment. This extra job creation and destruction activity amounts to $25\\%$ of baseline job reallocation at control firms. A more rapid pace of organic job creation and destruction accounts for $45\\%$ of the extra reallocation activity at target firms, and greater acquisitions and divestitures account for the rest. These results indicate that private equity buyouts catalyze the creative destruction process, as measured by job creation and destruction and by the transfer of production units between firms.  \n\nOur productivity findings reinforce this view. Specifically, compared to control firms, target firms more aggressively close manufacturing plants in the lower part of the total factor productivity (TFP) distribution. They also open new plants in the upper part of the TFP distribution at nearly twice the rate of control firms, and they are much less likely to open low productivity establishments. On average, over the first two years post buyout, we estimate that private equity buyouts raise TFP by 2.1 log points. (Baseline TFP growth for controls is slightly negative.) Three quarters of the post-buyout TFP gains reaped by target firms reflect a greater propensity to close low productivity plants and to open new, high productivity plants. In short, buyouts improve productivity mainly through the directed reallocation of resources across units within target firms. These TFP results and our results on worker earnings imply that private equity buyouts materially improve operating margins at target firms.  \n\nThe next section briefly reviews related research and offers additional motivation for our study. Section 3 describes the construction of our analysis datasets, and Section 4 explains our empirical methods. Sections 5 and 6 present our main establishment-level and firm-level analyses of employment and job reallocation effects. Section 7 considers effects on TFP and earnings per worker, and Section 8 offers concluding remarks.  \n\n## 2. Related Work and Additional Motivation  \n\nEconomists hold a longstanding interest in how ownership changes affect productivity and employment. Examples include Lichtenberg and Siegel (1987), Long and Ravenscraft (1993), McGuckin and Nguyen (2001), and Harris, Siegel and Wright (2005). One ownership change that attracts particular attention is the acquisition of firms by professional private equity firms. Jensen (1989) and Shleifer and Summers (1988), among others, discuss the economic effects of private equity buyouts based largely on case study evidence. Kaplan and Stromberg (2009) provide a useful overview of research on the economic effects of private equity.  \n\nFew previous studies focus on the employment effects of private equity, and the exceptions typically rely on small samples dictated by data availability. Kaplan (1989) considers 76 public-to-private leveraged buyouts (LBOs) during the 1980s. He finds that the median firm lost $12\\%$ of employment on an industry-adjusted basis from the end of the fiscal year prior to the private equity transaction to the end of the fiscal year after the transaction. After dropping target firms with asset sales or purchases that exceed $10\\%$ of total value, the adjusted employment decline is $6.2\\%$ for the remaining 24 firms. Muscarella and Vetsuypens (1990) consider 72 firms that completed an initial public offering (IPO) after an LBO between 1983 and 1987. For the 26 firms they can track, employment declines by an average of $0.6\\%$ between the LBO and the IPO.  \n\nLichtenberg and Siegel (1990) use U.S. Census Bureau data to examine changes in employment at the manufacturing plants of 131 firms undergoing buyouts between 1981 and 1986. On an industry-adjusted basis, employment falls by $1.2\\%$ per year after buyout, as compared to a $1.9\\%$ rate of decline beforehand. Declines are larger for non-production workers than blue-collar workers. Wright, Thompson and Robbie (1992) and Amess and Wright (2007) similarly find that buyouts in the UK lead to modest employment declines. These studies follow overall employment at a set of firms, and contrast it with aggregate employment at matching firms.3 Boucly, Sraer and Thesmar (2009) find that employment grows much more rapidly at target firms than at controls in the wake of French private equity buyouts, a result they atribute to an important role for private equity in relaxing financing constraints.  \n\nThese studies share certain weaknesses. First, most focus on the company-wide employment of firms backed by private equity. Thus, the sale of a division or other business unit is typically counted as an employment loss, even if the sold business unit continues with the same number of employees under new ownership. Likewise, the acquisition of a division or other business unit is counted as an employment gain, even if there is no employment change at the business unit itself. Several studies attempt to address this issue by dropping buyouts that involve substantial asset sales, but this sample restriction may greatly influence the results, given the extent of “asset shuffling’ by firms backed by private equity. The handful of previous U.S. studies that treat establishments as the unit of observation are typically restricted to the manufacturing sector, and even then have limited ability to track establishment or firm closings.  \n\nSecond, previous studies of U.S. private equity deals rely on highly selected samples - potentially an important source of bias in the findings. The public-to-private buyouts that dominate earlier samples account for less than one-quarter of the employees directly impacted by private equity buyouts and only 12 percent of the deals (Table 2 below). Most previous U.S. studies consider deals before the 1990s only, but fundraising by U.S. private equity groups rose 36-fold from 1985 to 1998 and more than 100-fold by 2006.4 The tremendous growth in private equity activity allows us to examine a much larger set of deals. Moreover, the nature of private equity activity has also changed over time - competition for attractive deals has intensified, and many private equity firms now have a strong operational orientation, as opposed to the financial engineering approach that characterized many groups during the 1980s.  \n\nOur study overcomes these weaknesses, as we have explained. In addition, we exploit the establishment-level aspect of our data to examine job creation and job destruction outcomes, as well as net employment changes. In this regard, we are motivated in part by previous work that documents a rapid pace of establishment-level job creation and destruction. Davis and Haltiwanger (1999) review work in this area.  Earlier empirical work also shows that the reallocation of jobs and workers across establishments plays a major role in medium-term productivity gains. Many important theoretical models also feature distinct roles for the creation and destruction margins of employment adjustment. Caballero (2007) provides an insightful, detailed analysis and extensive references to the relevant literature.  \n\nNumerous case studies provide detailed descriptions and analyses of particular private equity deals. By our reading, these studies deliver four sets of insights.  \n\nFirst, private equity groups sometimes generate few or no productivity gains because they fail to achieve their goals for target firms. For instance, when Berkshire Partners bought  \n\nWisconsin Central, it had an ambitious plan to raise productivity. However, technological problems arose soon after the buyout and prevented the deployment of a computerized control system that was crucial for planned cost savings. As a result, the numbers in an ambitious business plan were never met (Jensen, Burkhardt and Barry, 1990). In the Revco transaction a crippling debt load, management disarray, an inexperienced LBO sponsor, and a disastrous midstream shift in strategy led to a failure to achieve performance goals (Wruck, 1991).  \n\nSecond, the Revco case also points to tax savings as the primary source of private value creation in certain buyouts. Consistent with this view, Kaplan (1989b) provides evidence that greater leverage and other organizational shifts imposed by private equity investors can yield substantial tax savings that are “an important source of the wealth gains in leveraged buyouts.\" If tax savings are the principal motive for buyouts, there is no compelling reason to anticipate positive effects on productivity at target firms.  \n\nThird, many case studies find substantial productivity gains at target firms through improvements to existing operations. In the Hertz buyout, for instance, Clayton, Dubilier and Rice (CD&R) addressed operational inefficiencies to increase profitability. Specifically, CD&R lowered overhead costs by reducing inefficient labor expenses and cutting non-capital investments to industry standard levels, and more closely aligned managerial incentives with return on capital (Luehrman, 2007). Similarly, the buyout of O.M. Scott & Sons led to substantial improvements in the firm's existing operations, partly through powerful incentives offered to management and partly through specific suggestions by the private equity investors (Baker and Wruck, 1989). In examples like these, profitability increases and private value creation are likely to go hand in hand with productivity gains.  \n\nFinally, in a number of other cases, private equity targets achieved substantial efficiency improvements not by enhancing existing operations, but rather by divesting units. Beatrice had acquired a large number of unrelated businesses as part of a conglomerate strategy, many of which operated in segments in which it had little expertise. Its private equity investor, Kohlberg. Kravis and Roberts, divested many of these laggard operations (Baker, 1992). Similarly, the buyout group that purchased Kaiser Steel shut down its outdated and inefficient steel operations. The group focused its operational attention on Kaiser's coalmines, which it regarded as the firm's “hidden jewel’ (Luehrman, 1992). Greater profitability and private value creation are also likely to involve productivity gains in these examples, though mainly through productivityenhancing reallocation rather than operational improvements within continuing units.  \n\nThese case studies illustrate a wide range of motives for and effects of private equity transactions. Our study can be seen as an effort to determine which of these stories best characterizes the impact of private equity buyouts on average, especially with respect to employment and productivity outcomes.  \n\n## 3. Constructing the Analysis Samples  \n\nOur analysis requires a comprehensive database of private equity transactions and the matching of target firms to firm-level and establishment-level records in the LBD, ASM and CM. This section describes the data construction process and the resulting samples.  \n\nA. Identifying private equity buyout transactions  \n\nCapitallQ has specialized in tracking private equity deals on a worldwide basis since 1999 and, through extensive research, backfilled transactions prior to 1999. We consider all recorded transactions in CapitalIQ that closed between January 1980 and December 2005. We then impose two sample requirements. First, we omit transactions that do not involve a financial sponsor, i.e., a private equity firm. Second, we restrict attention to transactions that entail some use of leverage. Many transactions that do not involve leverage are venture capital investments rather than investments in mature firms. Given our focus, we omit transactions not classified by CapitallQ as “going private,” “leveraged buyout,” “management buyout,” “platform,” or a similar term. This approach excludes “growth buyouts” and “expansion capital\" investments to purchase a minority stake using little or no leverage. Such transactions may share some characteristics of private equity deals but do not fit the classic profile of leveraged buyouts.  \n\nAfter restricting the sample in these two ways, the resulting database contains about 11,000 transactions worldwide. Dropping transactions that involve firms with foreign headquarters leaves about 5,00o U.S. target firms acquired in private equity buyouts between 1980 and 2005. (We do not consider U.S. establishments operated by foreign targets.) To fill out our information about private equity transactions and target firms, we supplement the data drawn from CapitallQ with data from Dealogic, Thomson Reuters SDC, VentureXpert databases, and news stories. Dealogic, in particular, often contains greater detail about transaction characteristics. Other useful information in the supplementary sources includes alternative names associated with target firms and their later acquisitions and sales.  \n\n### B. Matching to LBD Records  \n\nThe LBD derives from the Census Bureau's Business Register, which contains annual data on U.S. businesses with paid employees. The LBD covers the entire nonfarm private sector from 1976 to 2005. In recent years, it contains over 6 million establishment records and almost 5 million firm records per year. The Business Register and the LBD draw on administrative records and survey sources for data on firms and their establishments. Core data items include employment, payroll, four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) or six-digit North American Industrial Classification (NAICS), employer identification numbers, business names, and information about location.° Identifiers in the LBD files enable us to compute growth rate measures for establishments and firms and to track their entry and exit and ownership changes. Firms in the LBD are defined based on operational control, and all establishments majority owned by a parent firm are included in the parent's activity measures.  \n\nTo merge data on buyouts into the LBD, we match names and addresses of private equity portfolio firms (i.e., target firms) to LBD name and address records. To cope with timing differences between datasets, we search over a three-year window in the LBD centered on the transaction year for each target firm. We adopt a conservative approach to matching that requires either an exact match on name and address or an approximate match on both name and address according to probability-based matching algorithms. Our procedures match about $65\\%$ of target firms to the LBD, $70\\%$ on a value-weighted basis, yielding about 3200 matched target firms. Once matched, firm-establishment links in the LBD serve to identify all establishments owned by target firms as of the private equity buyout year. Matched target firms operate about 150,000 U.S. establishments as of the buyout year. LBD longitudinal links allows us to follow firms and establishments over time. Tracking firms is more challenging, as we discuss below, which influences the design of our firm-level analysis sample.  \n\nGiven our interest in employment dynamics, the relationship of the LBD employment measure to the timing of private equity transactions requires careful treatment. The LBD reports total employment in the payroll period containing the week of March 12th. Accordingly, for buyout transactions that close before October 1, LBD employment in March of the same calendar year serves as our contemporaneous employment measure. We assign transactions that close on or after October 1 in year $t$ toyear $t+1$ for purposes of our analysis, treating the LBD employment value in March of $t+1$ as the contemporaneous measure. October is the natural cutoff because it lies midway between March-to-March employment changes in the LBD.  \n\nFigure 1 shows the number of U.S. target firms acquired by year and the number matched to the LBD. It is apparent that the number of private equity buyouts grew rapidly beginning in the mid-1990s. Table 1 shows the enterprise value (debt plus equity, as valued at the time of the transaction) of all private equity targets and the matched targets by decade. The enterprise value of private equity acquisitions is very large in the later years, reaching 420 billion in the 2000- 2005 period. Figure 2 displays employment data for our matched target firms. For example, target firms acquired in 2005 and matched to the LBD account for $0.83\\%$ of total nonfarm business employment in 2005. Given the extent of unmatched targets, the full set of firms that came under private equity control in 2005 accounts for more than $1\\%$ of privatesector employment. Based on our data, we infer that more than $7\\%$ of private employment came under private equity control at some point in the ten-year period from 1998 to 2007.7  \n\n### C. Analysis Samples  \n\nOur study considers several related analysis samples. For descriptive statistics on the number and volume of private equity buyouts and their distribution by industry and firm characteristics, we consider all matched targets through 2005. For our main establishment-level analysis, we consider buyouts from 1980 to 2000. This sample allows us to track target (and control) establishments for five years before and after the buyout year. For our firm-level analysis sample, we consider buyouts from 1980 to 2003, so that we can track firm-level outcomes for two years post buyout. We also consider various subsamples, the most important of which focus on buyouts in the manufacturing sector from 1980 to 2003. For the manufacturing subsample, we draw on ASM and CM data to construct plant-level TFP measures. Table 2 reports summary statistics on matched targets for our analysis samples.  \n\n## 4. Empirical Methods  \n\nThis section describes key methodological choices in our empirical study. The first relates to the unit of analysis. Section 5 considers establishments owned by target firms in the buyout year. We track these units over time, irrespective of their ownership in earlier or later years. For example, if the target firm goes public or sells an establishment, we continue to track that establishment and associate it with the buyout event. Section 6 takes a different approach, treating the firm as the unit of analysis, which lets us capture greenfield job creation and the acquisition and sale of establishments after the buyout event.  \n\nThe second key choice relates to controls. We need suitable controls because the distribution of private equity buyouts across industries and business characteristics is not random. For example, practitioner accounts often suggest a concentration of transactions in industries undergoing significant restructurings due to regulatory action, foreign competition, or technological  change. Target firms  in our data  are disproportionately  concentrated  in manufacturing, information services, and accommodation and food services, as shown in Figure B.1 of the web appendix. Target firms are also considerably larger and older than the average firm, as shown in Figure B.2.8 The literature on firm dynamics concludes that growth and volatility vary systematically with firm size and age. See, for example, Caves (1998), Davis et al. (2007), and Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda (2010). Thus, it is important to control for these characteristics when evaluating the reallocation and other effects of private equity buyouts.  \n\nThe huge number of firms and establishments in the LBD allows us to control for a full set of interactions among industry, size, age, multi-unit status, and year of the buyout transaction. We sort target firms into cells defined by the cross product of these characteristics.?” We then identify all firms in the LBD not backed by private equity that fall into the same cell as a given target firm, and we treat those firms as controls. Specifically, we control for the interaction of 72 two-digit industries, 10 firm size categories, 6 firm age categories, a dummy for firms with multiple establishments, and 24 distinct transaction years. The cross product of these categorical variables yields over 8,ooo control cells per year. Of course, many cells are unpopulated, but the richness of our controls is evident. In our regression analysis, we also control for pre-buyout employment growth histories. We follow the same approach in the establishment-level analysis. To obtain controls for a given target establishment, we select all establishments in the same control cell from among the set of active establishments in the transaction year, excluding establishments owned by a firm under private equity control.  \n\nA related choice involves our statistical approach to estimating the effects of buyouts on employment outcomes. We consider nonparametric comparisons that control for the crossproduct of our categorical variables, semi-parametric regressions that include additional controls, and propensity score methods. Ideally, we seek to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated, i.e., the average effect of buyouts on target firms. As discussed in Woolridge (2002, chapter 18), consistent estimation of average treatment effects requires conditional mean independence: conditional on the controls and the treatment indicator, outcomes for the treated and non-treated are independently distributed. Compared to previous research, our rich set of controls lends greater plausibility to this identifying assumption. Even if one questions the conditional mean independence assumption, our study yields a rich set of new findings about outcomes at private equity targets. These findings throw light on alternative views about the economic role of private equity, as we discuss below. Our findings also provide useful evidence for formulating and evaluating theoretical models of private equity behavior and effects.  \n\nA fourth choice relates to the time window around private equity transactions. Our establishment-level analysis considers employment outcomes for five years on either side of a private equity transaction. Five years is a typical holding period for target firms (Stromberg 2007). For our firm-level analysis, we must confront the reorganization of firms through mergers, ownership changes, partial divestitures, and acquisitions of establishments from other firms. Because it tracks both firms and establishments over time and contemporaneously links establishments to firms, the LBD offers greater scope for identifying these changes than most other business-level datasets. Nevertheless, some private equity targets undergo complex postbuyout restructurings that challenge the maintenance of high-integrity longitudinal links. We deal with this challenge in two ways. First, our firm-level analysis considers a relatively short window of two years after each buyout transaction, thereby limiting the linkage issues that arise from complex firm-level reorganizations. Second, we use our establishment-level data to assess the impact of potential sample selection bias in our firm-level analysis.  \n\nBefore proceeding, we define our employment and growth rate measures. Let $E_{i t}$ be employment at establishment or firm $i$ in year $t$ : i.e., the number of workers on the payroll in the pay period covering March 12. The employment growth rate is $g_{i t}=(E_{i t}-E_{i t-1})/X_{i t}$ ,where $X_{i t}=.5^{*}(E_{i t}+E_{i t-1})$ 1° Employment growth at any higher level of aggregation is the weighted mean of establishment or firm growth rates given by $g_{t}=\\sum_{i}(X_{i t}/X_{t})g_{i t}$ ，where $X_{t}=\\sum_{i}X_{i t}$ We consider the contributions of expanding and shrinking establishments, establishment entry and exit, and acquisitions and divestitures to firm-level employment changes, and compare outcomes between targets and controls on each of these adjustment margins.  \n\n## 5. Establishment-Level Analysis of Employment Outcomes  \n\n### A. Nonparametric comparisons  \n\nWe begin with an “event study” that compares employment outcomes at target establishments to outcomes at control establishments. To encompass a window of five years before and after buyouts, we consider transactions in the 1980-2000 period. As discussed above, we construct control cells as the cross product of industry, size of parent firm, age of parent firm, multi-unit status, and buyout year. Our firm size categories are 1-4, 5-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-99, 100-249, 250-499, 500-999, 1000-2499, 2500-4999, 5000-9999, and 10000 or m0re employees. Our firm age categories are 0-5 years, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, and 21 or more years.1l We use firm size and age measures to facilitate comparisons to our firm-level analysis below. Replacing firm size and age measures with measures based on establishment size and age yields similar results.  \n\nThe solid curve in Figure 3a shows the employment path of target establishments around the buyout year. Establishments that came under private equity ownership between 1980 and 2000 employed 2.3 million workers as of the buyout year. The dashed curve shows the counterfactual path of employment at targets had they grown at the same rate as controls. To construct this counterfactual, we first rescale the employment of controls to match that of targets cell by cell in the buyout year. We then apply the actual growth rates of the controls to generate the dashed curve.1² Comparing the solid and dashed curves highlights the critical need to evaluate target outcomes relative to controls. In particular, a simple comparison of outcomes at target firms before and after buyout events would produce a highly misleading impression about the employment effects of private equity.  \n\nFigure 3b tracks mean employment growth rate differences between target and control establishments from 5 years before to 5 years after the buyout year. Perhaps surprisingly, Figure 3b shows no systematic pattern of slower job growth at targets in the years leading up to buyouts. In the buyout year itself, employment growth at targets is actually 2 percentage points higher than at controls. However, there is a clear pattern of slower growth at targets post buyout, with growth differentials ranging from $0.5\\%$ to $2\\%$ per year. The differentials cumulate to $3.2\\%$ of employment in the first two years post buyout and $6.4\\%$ over five years. These results accommodate heterogeneous treatment effects over the cross product of industry, firm size, firm age, multi-unit status, and year of buyout. They recover the average treatment effect on the treated under the assumption of conditional mean independence, as we discussed above.13  \n\nPrevious research finds large gross job flows relative to net employment changes (Davis and Haltiwanger, 1999), raising the question of how employment responds to private equity buyouts on job creation and destruction margins. Figure 4 tells an important story in this regard: Slower employment growth at private equity targets post buyout entirely reflects a greater pace of job destruction. Indeed, gross job creation rates are greater at target establishments in the wake of buyouts. These results are interesting for at least two reasons. First, they indicate that buyouts accelerate the pace of employment change on destruction and creation margins, a theme we return to below. Second, Figure 4b confirms that jobs at target establishments are at greater risk post buyout than jobs at controls. As seen in Figure 5, about half of this greater risk reflects a higher post-buyout shutdown propensity at target establishments.  \n\n### B. Regression Analysis  \n\nWe turn now to a regression analysis that allows for additional controls and an easy calculation of standard errors in the estimated effects of private equity buyouts. Table 3 reports regression results for the buyout year and five subsequent years. Each regression involves the matched target establishments in buyouts from 1980 to 2000 and their corresponding control establishments. The dependent variable is the employment growth rate in the indicated year following the buyout. The first column in Table 3 reports the mean growth rate differentials from Figure 3b. The second and third columns report results for semi-parametric regressions that include controls for the pre-buyout growth history of parent and target firms.  \n\nWe include two variables to control for pre-buyout history. One variable considers the set of establishments owned by the target firm as of year O (the buyout year). We set the value of this variable to the employment growth rate of these establishments from year -3 to year -1. A second variable considers the parent firm that owned these establishments in year -3.  If ownership was split across multiple firms in year -3, we select the firm with the largest share of employment among these establishments. We then set the second variable to the employment growth rate of that firm from year -3 to year -1. Often, but not always, these two control variables take on the same value.  \n\nThe Table 3 regressions contain a large battery of additional controls. The column headed \"ATE $\\begin{array}{r}{{\\bf\\Pi}={\\bf\\Pi}}\\ {{\\bf\\Pi}}\\end{array}$ ATE1’\" includes a fully interacted set of controls for two-digit industry, firm size, firm age, multi-unit status, and year. This specification posits a common treatment effect, given by the coefficient on an indicator variable for target establishments in private equity buyouts. The column headed “ATE1 Heterogeneous” includes the same set of controls, but relaxes the assumption of uniform treatment effects by interacting the private equity indicator with the 6 firm age categories, 10 firm size categories, and the two measures of pre-buyout growth history.14 This specification is more restrictive than the nonparametric specification in some respects but less restrictive in the inclusion of controls for pre-buyout growth history and in allowing the treatment effect to vary with pre-buyout employment growth. To recover the average treatment effect on the treated in this case, we compute a weighted average of the heterogeneous estimated treatment effects, using cell-level employment weights of targets in the transaction year. We calculate standard errors by the Delta method.  \n\nAs seen in Table 3, the nonparametric and semi-parametric specifications deliver similar results. The two semi-parametric regressions also yield small standard errors and tightly estimated effects of private equity buyouts. Five-year cumulative employment losses at targets range from $-4.7\\%$ to $-6.4\\%$ , depending on specification, with somewhat smaller losses in the semi-parametric specifications.15 In short, the evidence says that target establishments experience deeper job losses after private equity buyouts than control establishments.  \n\n## 6. Firm-Level Analysis of Employment Outcomes  \n\n### A. Tracking Firms  \n\nSection 5 considers outcomes for establishments owned by target firms at the time of the buyout deal. We now shift to a firm-level analysis to capture new establishments opened after the deal as well as post-buyout acquisitions and divestitures. By necessity, we restrict attention to target firms that we can track post buyout. While we can readily track establishments over time in the LBD, tracking firms is more challenging for two reasons: the disappearance of firm identifiers (IDs) in some circumstances, and irregularities in Census Bureau tracking of private equity targets involved in divisional sales.  \n\nThe disappearance of a firm identifier (ID) in the LBD can occur for various reasons. One is the death of a firm and closure of its establishments. Firm death in this sense presents no problem for our analysis, and we capture such events whether they involve target or control firms. A more difficult situation involves a firm ID in year O that disappears in later years, even though some of the establishments owned by the firm in year O continue to operate. This situation can arise because of a merger or complex reorganization (e.g., different components of the original firm are bought by multiple existing firms). It is inherently difficult to define and measure firm growth when the original legal entity ceases to exist, and we exclude these observations in our firm-level analysis. To reduce the number of observations lost for this reason, we limit our firm-level analysis to years 1 and 2 after the buyout.  \n\nIn the course of our data development and analysis, we discovered that the Census Bureau did not accurately track firm IDs in certain private equity transactions. Inaccuracies sometimes arose when a private equity group acquired one or more divisions of a corporate entity, but not the whole firm. In principle, the Annual Company Organization Survey (sent to all large multi-unit companies) lets Census track these divisional sales. However, we identified divisional sales in which the firm ID of the (new) target firm remained the same as the ID of the selling firm. This problem did not affect the establishment-level analysis in Section 5, because we could rely on an alternative identifier - the Employer Identification Number (EIN) - to accurately identify, as of the transaction year, establishments involved in divisional sales. Unfortunately, EINs are unsuitable for tracking firms because new and acquired establishments may obtain new EINs. We therefore exclude divisional cases from our firm-level analysis for those cases when Census does not provide an accurate ID for the target firm.16  \n\nFor the firm-level analysis, we expand the sample period of buyout events to run through 2003. (A firm-level analysis for the period running from 1980 to 2000 yields similar results.) As reported in Table 2, our full matched sample contains 2265 target firms from 1980 to 2003. They account for about 4.3 million workers and 104,000 establishments as of the buyout year. Excluding the divisional, EIN cases that lack accurate firm IDs yields 1874 target firms with about 3.4 million workers and 79,000 establishments.f 7 Further restricting attention to firms that we can track for two years after the buyout year, including deaths, yields a sample of 1,374 firms and 3.2 million workers. This sample represents 73 percent of the matched sample with accurate firm IDs and 93 percent of their employment. The latter statistic is more relevant given our focus on employment-weighted outcomes.  \n\n### B. Firm-Level Employment Results  \n\nOur firm-level analysis considers  the same type  of  semi-parametric regression specifications as in Table 3. Now, however, we explore employment responses on several adjustment margins, including the entry of new establishments post buyout. As before, the regressions include the pre-buyout growth variables and the cross product of industry, firm size categories, firm age categories, multi-unit status, and buyout year as controls. We weight observations by employment, as before. To obtain the effect of interest, we rely on indicator variables for target firms.  \n\nTable 4 presents firm-level regression results for cumulative responses over the first two years post buyout. Again, we report results for an ATE $\\equiv$ ATE1 specification that posits a uniform treatment effect, and for an ATE1 Heterogeneous specification that allows treatment effects to vary with pre-buyout history and across firm age and size categories. The top row in Table 4 says that target firms shrink more rapidly than controls in the two-year period after buyouts - by 0.88 percentage points in the ATE $\\equiv$ ATE1 specification and 0.65 percentage points in the ATE1 Heterogeneous specification. These estimated effects are much smaller than the cumulative twoyear difference of 2.9 points for both specifications in Table 3. This comparison suggests that the additional adjustment margins captured by the firm-level analysis alter the picture of how private equity buyouts affect employment outcomes.  \n\nThe remaining rows in Table 4 address the issue directly in the firm-level sample. Focus on the ATE1 Heterogeneous specification, and consider first the results for “Continuers\" and \"Deaths\", two adjustment margins captured by the establishment-level analysis.18 Summing these two components yields a two-year employment growth rate differential of -5.49 percentage points (-1.36 - 4.13) for targets, a large difference. But target firms create more new jobs at new establishments in the first two years after buyouts, a difference of 1.87 points in favor of targets. Combining these three adjustment margins yields a differential of -3.62 percentage points for targets.1? Finally, bringing in the role of acquisitions and divestitures reduces this differential to -0.81 points, close to the estimated differential in the top row. Thus, the overall impact of private equity buyouts on firm-level employment growth is quite modest.  \n\nAs a robustness check, we also estimate the average treatment effect of private equity buyouts on firm-level employment growth using propensity score methods. We construct propensity scores by fitting logit specifications, one for each buyout year, for the likelihood that a firm becomes a private equity target. The logit specification includes the pre-buyout growth variables and the cross product of industry, firm size categories, firm age categories, and multiunit status. Our second-stage regression includes an indicator for private equity targets, as before, plus the propensity score measure interacted with year effects. Using this second-stage regression, we estimate that a private equity buyout raises firm-level employment growth by 0.26 percentage points in the first two years post buyout, with a standard error of 0.18 points.20 Thus, under the propensity score approach, we cannot reject the hypothesis that private equity buyouts have zero net impact on employment growth at target firms.  \n\nIt is worth stressing that our firm-level and establishment-level regression analyses answer different questions. The establishment-level analysis tells us what happens to employment at establishments owned by target firms as of the buyout year. The firm-level analysis tells us what happens to employment at target firms, overall and on various adjustment margins. In practice, the main difference is that the firm-level analysis picks up large differentials between targets and controls in job creation at newly opened establishments and in employment changes associated with acquisitions and divestitures.  \n\nC. Private Equity: Agents of Reallocation within Firms?  \n\nTable 4 and Figure 4 suggest that buyouts act as catalysts for creative destruction. Target firms exhibit more job destruction in establishment shutdowns and more job creation in establishment births, larger job losses through divestment and larger job gains through acquisition. This evidence is consistent with two distinct hypotheses. One hypothesis holds that private equity acts as an agent of change - inducing some target firms to expand relative to controls and others to retrench. According to this hypothesis, the evidence reflects a combination of (a) upsizing target firms that add establishments and jobs more rapidly than controls and (b) downsizing target firms that shed jobs and establishments more rapidly than controls. The positive effects of buyouts on job creation and destruction then result by aggregating over upsizing and downsizing cases. A second hypothesis holds that private equity acts as an agent of restructuring within target firms, accelerating the reallocation of jobs across establishments in these firms and their pace of acquisition and divestment. These hypotheses are not exclusive because private equity could accelerate both types of creative destruction.  \n\nTo evaluate these hypotheses, we now estimate buyout effects on firm-level reallocation measures. A firm's job reallocation is the sum of its gross job gains due to new, expanding, and acquired establishments and gross job losses due to exiting, shrinking, and divested establishments. Its excess reallocation is the difference between job reallocation and the absolute value of its net job growth.2l If a given firm changes employment in the same direction at all of its establishments, it has zero excess reallocation. To the extent that a firm expands employment at some units and contracts employment at others, it has positive excess reallocation. If the firm adds jobs at some of its establishments and cuts an equal number of jobs at other establishments, excess reallocation equals job reallocation. So, if private equity acts exclusively as agents of change, the entire creative destruction response of target firms involves higher job reallocation but no impact on excess reallocation. At the other extreme, if private equity acts exclusively as agents of restructuring within target firms, firm-level job reallocation and excess reallocation rates respond by the same amount to buyouts.  \n\nTable 5 reports regression results for firm-level job reallocation and excess reallocation rates using the same specifications and two-year horizon as in Table 4. In the ATE1 Heterogeneous specification, the job reallocation rate is 13.9 percentage points higher at target firms, and the excess reallocation rate is 9.3 points higher. Thus, two-thirds of the extra job reallocation associated with private equity buyouts reflects an accelerated pace of restructuring within target firms. For organic changes, the impact of buyouts on excess reallocation - $6.4\\%$ Oof initial employment over two years - is actually greater than the impact on total job reallocation.22 In short, and especially for organic employment changes, Table 5 implies that private equity acts predominantly as an agent of (accelerated) restructuring within target firms.  \n\nThe regression results in Tables 3, 4, and 5 identify only the differential responses of targets relative to controls. To recover information about the levels of creation and destruction activity, we return to the nonparametric approach of section 5.A and consider a counterfactual exercise along the lines of Figure 3. Specifically, we sort target and control observations in our 1980-2003 firm-level analysis sample into cells defined by the same cross product of industry, size, age, multi-unit status, and buyout year as before. For each cell, we calculate cumulative two-year changes post buyout for each employment adjustment margin. We then generate the weighted average outcomes for targets and controls using the same approach to weighting as in  \n\nFigure 3. These calculations reveal the extent of creation and destruction activity on each adjustment margin at target firms, and they tell us how target firm activity would differ if targets exhibited the same behavior as controls.  \n\nTable 6 reports the results of these calculations. They show high rates of creation and destruction at target firms in the wake of private equity buyouts. The two-year cumulative job reallocation at target firms is 52 percent of initial employment for organic changes (Panel A) and 69 percent inclusive of acquisitions and divestitures (Panel B). According to the “Difference\" column in Panel A of Table 6, buyouts raise job creation, destruction and reallocation rates by, respectively, 2.0, 4.3 and 6.3 percent of initial employment, which amount to 9, 19 and 14 percent of the base rates at control firms. Panel B shows that the increases in creation, destruction, and reallocation associated with buyouts are considerably larger, in both absolute and relative terms, when including acquisitions and divestitures. To check the consistency of these results with Tables 4 and 5, the two rightmost columns in Panels A and B report the semiparametric regression estimates of target-control differences. The two approaches yield similar estimated differences, and the differences are precisely estimated.  \n\nTable 6 also reveals that excess reallocation accounts for more than 95 percent of overall job reallocation for both target and control firms, whether considering organic changes or including acquisitions and divestitures. About two-thirds of excess reallocation occurs within firms for organic employment changes, 56-58 percent when including acquisitions and divestitures. Excess job reallocation within the same firm and county (not shown in the table) accounts for half of all excess job reallocation within control firms, and slightly less within target firms. Putting these results together, the movement of job positions across locations within the same firm and county account for about one-third of all excess job reallocation for organic adjustment margins and about one-quarter when including acquisitions and divestitures.  \n\nD. Differential Employment Responses by Time Period, Industry, and Buyout Type  \n\nThe foregoing analyses could mask important differences in private equity effects by time period, industry, or type of buyout. Descriptive accounts suggest that private equity groups shifted to a more operational orientation over time, which could lead to time-varying effects on target employment. The scale of private buyout activity also increased enormously over time, which could alter the character of the marginal target and its post-buyout performance. Motivated by these observations, Figure C.2 in the appendix displays the evolution of targetcontrol growth rate differences for buyouts that took place in the 1980s, 1990-94, and 1995- 2000. In each period, employment contracts more rapidly at targets than at controls in the years following private equity buyouts.  \n\nSome accounts of private equity paint a picture of aggressive cost cutting through layoffs. This characterization suggests a potential for greater post-buyout job destruction rates in laborintensive industries, reflecting a view that cost cutters focus on the largest cost sources. More generally, there are major differences in factor cost shares, market structure, demand conditions, and labor relations that might lead to important industry differences in the responses to private equity buyouts. Motivated by these ideas, Appendix Figure C.3 displays the evolution of targetcontrol growth differences for three industry sectors that cover most private equity buyouts. Employment falls modestly at target establishments relative to controls post buyout in Manufacturing. Retail Trade exhibits a markedly different response pattern. In the years leading up to buyout transactions, controls and targets in Retail Trade exhibit similar growth rates. Post buyout, however, employment at target establishments falls by nearly 12 percent relative to controls over five years. The Service sector exhibits yet a different pattern. Targets grow much rapidly than controls before the buyout year but more slowly afterwards. These large industry differences serve as a caution against painting with an overly broad brush when characterizing employment outcomes in the wake of private equity buyouts.  \n\nThere are also good reasons to think employment effects vary by type of buyout. Publicto-private deals may be more likely to involve target firms with a strong need for cost cutting, as in the Beatrice case (Baker, 1992). Better funding access and relaxed constraints on capital investment and job creation are more likely to motivate deals for privately held firms. In light of these arguments, Table 7 reports estimated average effects on two-year post-buyout rates of employment growth and excess job reallocation by type of buyout. In public-to-private deals, target employment contracts more than 10 percent relative to controls over two years. As reported in appendix Table C.3, target firms in these deals experience much greater job losses due to establishment deaths and divestitures and less job creation through births. Along with the high visibility of public-to-private deals, these results help understand concerns about job loss related to private equity buyouts. In striking contrast, employment at independent targets (private-to-private deals) expands 10 percent relative to controls in the first two years post buyout.  More rapid employment growth at independent targets reflects a higher pace of acquisition, consistent with the view that private equity investments facilitate firm-level expansion.?3 Most U.S. buyout transactions involve independent targets, even though public-toprivate transactions garner much more attention. In terms of buyout-year employment, independent targets account for about 63 percent more jobs than publicly held targets (Table 2).  \n\nOne common pattern emerges for all deal types in Table 7: excess reallocation rates are higher at target firms than at controls. The magnitude of the target-control difference in excess reallocation varies greatly by type of transaction, but it is positive and highly statistically significant in all cases.  \n\n## 7. Effects on Productivity and Worker Earnings  \n\nA. Productivity Measurement and Sample Weights  \n\nOur productivity analysis considers plant-level observations covered by the Census of Manufactures (CM) and the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM). The CM surveys all but the smallest manufacturing plants once every five years. The ASM, a rotating panel of manufacturing plants, samples the largest units with certainty and other units with probabilities increasing in size. Following Baily, Hulten, and Campbell (1992) and others, we compute plantlevel log TFP as $l n T F P_{i t}=l n Q_{i t}-\\alpha_{K}l n K_{i t}-\\alpha_{L}l n L_{i t}-\\alpha_{M}l n M_{i t}$ where $i$ and $t$ index plant and year, respectively, $Q$ is real output, $K$ is real capital, $L$ is labor input, $M$ is materials, and $\\upalpha$ denotes factor elasticities. Operationally, we measure plant output as shipments plus the change in inventories, deflated by industry-level price indices. We measure capital separately for structures and equipment using perpetual inventory methods. Labor is total hours of production and non-production workers. We measure and deflate energy and other materials separately, and we measure the factor elasticities using industry-level cost shares.24  \n\nBecause the CM takes place every five years and the ASM over samples larger plants, our study of productivity outcomes adjusts for the probability that a given observation appears in a given analysis sample. To do so, we first create indicator variables for whether each observation appears in a given analysis sample.2s We then fit year-by-year logit models to the indicator variables, obtaining estimated sample inclusion probabilities for each observation.  \n\nExplanatory variables are dummies for industry (4-digit SIC or 6-digit NAICS), payroll size classes, employment size classes, multi-unit status, target status, and interactions between multiunit status and industry. The LBD contains data on these explanatory variables for every plantyear observation. We set the propensity weight for each observation to the reciprocal of its model-implied sample inclusion probability.2?  \n\n### B. Do Target Firms Direct Reallocation To More Productive Plants?  \n\nSection 6 shows that private equity buyouts accelerate job reallocation. Much of the extra reallocation involves establishment births and deaths. We now consider whether target firms direct this reallocation activity in ways that affect productivity. To that end, we first sort target plants and controls into terciles of the same-industry/same-year TFP distribution. We then investigate how plant entry and exit probabilities vary by location in the TFP distribution for targets in comparison to controls.  \n\nPanel A in Table 8 reports estimated exit probabilities in the first two years post buyout. We obtain these probabilities from a logit model fit to an exit indicator variable, where the explanatory variables are dummies for TFP terciles interacted with target and control dummies. Two results stand out: First, exit probabilities decline much more steeply with TFP for target plants than for controls. Second, targets exhibit greater exit probabilities in the bottom and middle terciles of the own-industry TFP distribution. The target-control exit differential is 5 percentage points in both terciles and significant at the $2.5\\%$ level in the bottom tercile.  \n\nPanel B provides information about the location of new plants in the TFP distribution, where new plants are those that enter in the first or second year post buyout. We obtain entry probabilities from a logit model fit to an entry indicator variable, where, as before, the explanatory variables are dummies for TFP terciles interacted with target and control dummies. The Panel B results uncover a striking contrast between targets and controls in the productivity of new plants: The prevalence of new plants in the bottom TFP tercile is only half as large for targets as controls, and the prevalence of new plants in the top tercile is nearly twice as large for targets. New plants are concentrated in the upper part of the TFP distribution at firms backed by private equity. The opposite pattern holds at contro firms.27  \n\nC. Quantifying Buyout Effects on Total Factor Productivity  \n\nWe can briefly summarize the evidence in Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8 as follows: Private equity buyouts accelerate job reallocation within target firms, and target firms direct reallocation activity in ways that raise TFP. We now develop additional evidence on the relationship of private equity buyouts to TFP. We then pull together several results to quantify and decompose the effects of buyouts on firm-level TFP growth.  \n\nTable 9 reports results for propensity-weighted OLS regressions that compare log TFP between target and control plants in the same industry-year. In addition to the full set of industryyear effects, the regressions include an extensive set of firm size and age effects.?\\* Panels A and B consider productivity outcomes in buyout years $t$ and $t{+}2$ , respectively, and Panel C considers TFP log changes for continuers. The most striking results involve entrant productivity: target entrants are $18~\\mathrm{log}$ points more productive in year $t{+}2$ than continuing control plants and $22~\\mathrm{log}$ points more productive than control entrants. These large TFP advantages reflect a concentration of target entrants in the upper part of the TFP distribution and the opposite pattern for control entrants (Table 8). Although the effects are smaller and the evidence less powerful, Table 9 also confirms that plant exit patterns raise TFP at target firms, absolutely and relative to control firms. In contrast, we find no evidence that target continuers experience more rapid TFP growth than control continuers. Panel C makes this point directly: the estimated target-control differential for TFP growth is one log point, with a standard error of 11 log points. If private equity buyouts improve relative TFP in continuing plants, the effects are either too small to reliably discern in our sample, or the gains mount too slowly to capture in our two-year tracking interval.?9  \n\nTo quantify the overall effect of private equity buyouts on firm-level TFP and assess the role of various adjustment margins, consider the difference-in-difference $\\Delta P_{t}-\\Delta\\widetilde P_{t}$ ,where  \n\n$$\n\\Delta P_{t}=\\left[S_{t+2}^{C}P_{t+2}^{C}-S_{t}^{C}P_{t}^{C}\\right]+\\left[S_{t+2}^{N}P_{t+2}^{N}-S_{t}^{X}P_{t}^{X}\\right]+\\left[S_{t+2}^{A}P_{t+2}^{A}-S_{t}^{D}P_{t}^{D}\\right].\n$$  \n\nis the average two-year change in TFP among target firms, $S$ denotes an employment share, $P$ denotes a TFP value, and $C,N,X,A$ and $D$ denote continuers, entrants, exits, acquisitions, and divestitures, respectively. For example, $P_{t+2}^{C}$ is the average TFP among continuing target plants two years post buyout, where each plant's TFP is expressed as a deviation from mean log TFP in the same industry-year cell. The average two-year TFP differential for controls, $\\Delta\\widetilde{P}_{t}$ , is defined analogously. Now express the TFP terms as deviations about same-year TFP values for control continuers, cancel terms in $\\Delta P_{t}-\\Delta\\widetilde P_{t}$ , and rearrange to obtain:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\Delta P_{t}-\\Delta\\widetilde{P}_{t}=S_{t+2}^{C}\\left(P_{t+2}^{C}-\\widetilde{P}_{t+2}^{C}\\right)-S_{t}^{C}\\left(P_{t}^{C}-\\widetilde{P}_{t}^{C}\\right)}\\ &{\\qquad+S_{t+2}^{N}\\left(P_{t+2}^{N}-\\widetilde{P}_{t+2}^{C}\\right)-\\widetilde{S}_{t+2}^{N}\\left(\\widetilde{P}_{t+2}^{N}-\\widetilde{P}_{t+2}^{C}\\right)-S_{t}^{X}\\left(P_{t}^{X}-\\widetilde{P}_{t}^{C}\\right)+\\widetilde{S}_{t}^{X}\\left(\\widetilde{P}_{t}^{X}-\\widetilde{P}_{t}^{C}\\right)}\\ &{\\qquad+S_{t+2}^{A}\\left(P_{t+2}^{A}-\\widetilde{P}_{t+2}^{C}\\right)-\\widetilde{S}_{t+2}^{A}\\left(\\widetilde{P}_{t+2}^{A}-\\widetilde{P}_{t+2}^{C}\\right)-S_{t}^{D}\\left(P_{t}^{D}-\\widetilde{P}_{t}^{C}\\right)+\\widetilde{S}_{t}^{D}\\left(\\widetilde{P}_{t}^{D}-\\widetilde{P}_{t}^{C}\\right)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe top line of (1) isolates the contribution of target-control differences among continuing plants, the second line isolates the contribution of plant entry and exit (births and deaths), and the third line isolates the contribution of acquisitions and divestitures.  \n\nThis decomposition is new to the literature to our knowledge and has some attractive features. It shows how to combine diff-in-diff estimates with an accounting decomposition that appears often in the empirical literature on firm-level productivity dynamics. To see this point, note that the expressions in parentheses can be read directly from Table 9. The shares $S$ canbe retrieved from the job creation and destruction statistics reported in Appendix Table C.2, the manufacturing analog to Table 6. Related, (1) lets us exploit the full LBD to compute the share variables, while relying on the ASM-CM sample to obtain the diff-in-diff estimates. The decomposition also sidesteps any need to compare TFP across industries or years, because all productivity terms in (1) are based on plant-level TFP deviations about industry-year means.  \n\nTable 10 exploits (1) to obtain the average TFP growth differential between target and control firms and its decomposition by margin of adjustment. Target firms out perform controls with respect to post-buyout TFP growth by 2.14 log points over two years, a large gain compared to the change of -0.38 log points among control continuers. Summing over terms in the second line of (1) yields a value of 1.59, implying that plant entry and exit effects account for 74 percent of the superior TFP growth at target firms. This result confirms the importance of the targetcontrol differences on the entry and exit margins documented in Tables 8 and 9.  \n\nFor additional insight into the nature of the entry and exit effects, we replace $S^{N}$ and $\\tilde{S}^{N}$ with their average in (1), do the same for $S^{X}$ and $\\tilde{S}^{X}$ , and then recalculate the second line of (1) to obtain a value of 1.56 log points. This calculation corresponds to a counterfactual that turns off target-control differences in the pace of job reallocation to isolate the role of differences in its direction. The message is clear: The stronger directedness of job reallocation in target firms accounts for almost all of the entry and exit contribution to (1) and, indeed, more than 70 percent $\\Delta P_{t}-\\Delta\\widetilde P_{t}$  \n\nTwo other remarks help put this finding in perspective. First, while directional differences are central to our explanation for superior TFP growth at target firms, they matter because entry and exit involve sizable rates of job creation and destruction. In this respect, both the pace of job reallocation and the target-control directional differences are essential. Second, reallocation rates are considerably higher outside the manufacturing sector, as readily seen by comparing Tables 6 and C.2. This fact has potentially important implications for the TFP effects of buyouts in the private sector as a whole. If we plug private sector share values from Table 6 into (1) alongside diff-in-diff estimates from Table 9, the implied TFP growth advantage of targets is 3.05 log points, 81 percent of which is due to entry and exit effects.  \n\n### D. Effects on Earnings Per Worker  \n\nTables 8-10 provide strong evidence that, on average, private equity buyouts improve operating performance, at least in the manufacturing sector. To investigate whether buyouts also affect operating margins via unit input costs, we now consider LBD data on annual earnings per worker (EPW) at the establishment level. (\"Earnings\"” encompass all taxable forms of compensation.) We follow the same approach to selecting control establishments as in Section 5, and we again exploit the size of the LBD to include an extensive set of controls in the regression specifications. Table 11 reports the results, following the same layout as Table 9. As before, the units of the estimated effects are log deviations about industry-year means.  \n\nThere are several noteworthy results. First, among plants destined to exit within two years post buyout, average EPW are 9-12 log points lower than at control continuers. This evidence rejects the view that firms backed by private equity tend to close establishments with high EPW.  \n\nSecond, target firms divest establishments with high EPW, whereas controls do not. The EPW difference for divestitures is 22 log points in favor of reduced labor costs for targets, a huge difference. Third, Panel C reports that average EPW shrink by 2.4 log points at target continuers relative to control continuers over the first two years post buyout. Fourth, we also applied equation (1) to the diff-in-diff estimates in Table 11 and reallocation rates in Table 6 to construct the EPW counterpart to Table 10 above. That exercise reveals an overall two-year post-buyout EPW decline of 4.0 log points for target firms (relative to controls).3° Continuers account for 79 percent of the relative EPW reduction at target firms, acquisitions and divestitures account for 29 percent, and net entry effects actually raise relative EPW at target firms.  \n\nAppendix Table C.4 reports additional EPW regressions. Continuing establishments operated by target firms experience large post-buyout EPW cuts of 6-8 log points (relative to controls) in Wholesale, Retail, and Services - industries that rely heavily on less skilled labor - while FIRE shows a large EPW gain of 9 log points, and Manufacturing shows virtually no change. EPW at target continuers decline by 7 log points in public-to-private deals and by 2 points in private-toprivate deals. Divestitures contribute to relative EPW reductions at targets firms for all private equity deal types, with an especially pronounced divestiture effect in private-to-private deals. In summary, while the details of the EPW results differ somewhat by industry and buyout type, the prevailing pattern is one of reduced EPW at target firms in the wake of private equity buyouts. Related work by Neumak and Sharpe (1996) and Bertrand and Mullainathan (1999), for example, finds mixed results for the effects of hostile takeovers on worker earnings. We believe there is much room for additional research on how ownership changes affect labor costs and worker earnings.  \n\n## 8. Concluding Remarks  \n\nOur study develops new evidence on the responses of employment, job reallocation, productivity, and worker earnings to private equity buyouts. Compared to previous research, we exploit a much larger sample of buyouts, a much more extensive set of controls, and a novel ability to track outcomes at firms and establishments. These advantages enable us to overcome important limitations in previous research and address controversies about the effects of private equity buyouts on jobs and operating performance. We also exploit the strengths of our data to explore new questions about private equity's role in the creative destruction process and its impact on restructuring activity inside target firms.  \n\nOur findings support the view that private equity buyouts lead to greater job loss at establishments operated by target firms as of the buyout year. Employment at these establishments shrinks by 3 percent relative to controls in the two-year period post buyout and by 6 percent over five years. Gross job destruction at target establishments outpaces destruction at controls by a cumulative 10 percentage points over five years post buyout. Thus, pre-existing employment positions are at greater risk of loss in the wake of private equity buyouts.  \n\nWhile noteworthy, these results make up only part of a richer and more interesting story. Using our ability to track each firm's constituent establishments, we examine how jobs respond to buyouts on several adjustment margins, including job creation at greenfield establishments opened post buyout. This aspect of our analysis reveals that target firms create new jobs in newly opened establishments at a faster pace than control firms. Accounting for the purchase and sale of establishments as well, the target-control growth differential is less than 1 percent of initial employment over two years.  \n\nPrivate equity buyouts involve much larger effects on the gross creation and destruction of jobs. The job reallocation rate at target firms exceeds that of controls by 14 percentage points over two years post buyout. About 45 percent of the extra job reallocation reflects a more rapid pace of organic employment adjustments, and the rest reflects acquisitions and divestitures. We find greater job reallocation in the wake of private equity buyouts for public-to-private deals, private-to-private deals, divisional sales, and secondary sales. These novel findings provide evidence that private equity buyouts catalyze the creative destruction process as measured by gross job flows and the purchase and sale of business establishments. Digging deeper, we also address two distinct hypotheses about the nature of the increased reallocation activity associated with private equity buyouts. One hypothesis sees private equity as agents of change in the sense that buyouts accelerate retrenchments at some target firms, while accelerating expansion at others. Another hypothesis sees private equity as agents of restructuring in the sense that buyouts accelerate the reallocation of jobs across establishments within target firms. We show the restructuring effect predominates, and it is the entire story for organic employment changes.  \n\nOur investigation into the effects of private equity buyouts on TFP growth in the manufacturing sector yields a highly complementary set of results. Relative to controls, target firms more aggressively close plants with low TFP, and they more aggressively open new plants with high TFP. In other words, target firms direct job reallocation activity on the plant entry and exit margins in ways that raise TFP. On average, target firms out perform control firms with respect to TFP growth by 2.1 log points over two years post buyout. More than 70 percent of the estimated TFP gains arise from private equity influence on the direction of job reallocation on plant entry and exit margins. These results refute the view that the returns to private equity rest entirely on private gains to financial engineering and wealth transfers from other stakeholders.  \n\nWe also find sizable reductions in earnings per worker in the first two years post buyout. Specifically, we estimate an average two-year post-buyout reduction in earnings per worker of 4 log points at target firms relative to controls, mostly due to reductions at continuing plants. In sum, our evidence indicates that private equity buyouts improve operating margins at target firms by raising productivity and by lowering unit labor costs. The resulting gains in profitability are magnified in their impact on corporate earnings per share by the leveraged capital structures that characterize firms acquired in private equity buyouts.  \n\nBy identifying a large sample of private equity transactions and linking them to the LBD, ASM and CM, this paper also sets the stage for new research into buyout effects on capital expenditures, other input costs, profitability, and other outcomes. A rich array of input and outcome measures are available at the firm and establishment level in Census Bureau data sets that can be linked to the LBD and our data on private equity transactions. Our plans for future work also include further investigation into how and why buyout effects differ by industry and type of buyout, and an examination of outcomes in corporations that sell to private equity groups. Many divisional buyouts involve divestitures of underperforming units that may place heavy demands on senior management. Schoar (2002) documents that acquisitions can lead managers to neglect core businesses, what she calls the “new toy” effect. The LBD allows us to investigate whether the same phenomenon operates in reverse when firms sell underperforming or poorly fitting divisions, thereby freeing senior management to focus on core activities.  \n\n## References  \n\nAmess, K. and M.

Table entries report estimated employment growth rate differences between targets and controls in the buyout year and following years. For example, the entries for “Buyout Year $+2^{\\mathfrak{N}}$ report the estimated growth rate difference from Year 1 to Year 2 following the buyout. Each reported coefficient is for a different nonparametric comparison or regression. Standard errors are in parentheses. They are computed by the delta method in the “ATE1 Heterogeneous\" regression.   \n2. The nonparametric comparison reflects the patterns displayed in Figure 3b. As explained in the text, this comparison allows for heterogeneous treatment effects and controls for the fully interacted cross product of 72 industries, 10 firm size categories, 6 firm age groups, multi-unit status, and buyout year.   \n3. The semi-parametric regression specifications include fully interacted industry, year, firm age, firm size and multi-unit effects plus additional controls for pre-buyout growth history. The “ATE $\\equiv$ ATE1\"” specification imposes a uniform treatment effect, while the “ATE1 Heterogeneous\"’ specification allows the treatment effect to vary by firm size, firm age, and the two measures of pre-buyout growth history.   \n. The average number of establishment-level observations in each regression or nonparametric comparison is about 4.9 million. The observation count falls with each successive year following the transaction year because of target deaths and deleted observations for the corresponding control establishments.  \n\nTable 4.

The baseline average two-year TFP change for control firms is an estimated -0.38 log points with an estimated standard error of 0.24. This estimate is obtained from a propensity-weighted regression of the two-year log change in TFP on a constant and target status dummy in the sample of continuing target and control plants, the same sample used for Panel C in Table 9.  \n\n### Table 11.

All specifications include the full cross product of industry, year, firm size, and firm age effects.   \n2. The reported results are for weighted regressions equivalent to a nonparametric matching estimator in Panel C and approximately equivalent in Panels A and B. The observation for each control establishment is weighted by the ratio of targets to controls in the same industry-year-size-age cell. Similar results obtain with equal weighting of all observations.   \n3. There are about 1.7 million observations in the Panel A regression, 1.8 million in the Panel B regression and 1.3 million in the Panel C regression. Like Table 9, this analysis focuses on target and control plants part of multi-unit firms. Results (available upon request) including SU plants are very similar.   \n4. By design, this table considers firms that continue from the buyout year t to $_{\\mathrm{t}+2}$ . If we add firm exits to the sample, the “Exits” row of Panel A changes slightly: the coefficient remains -0.085 (0.006) for Targets and becomes -0.120 (0.004) for Controls.  \n\n# For Online Posting; Not Intended for Publication  \n\nPrivate Equity, Jobs, and Productivity: Appendix  \n\n# A. Matching Issues and Robustness to EIN Cases  \n\nWe consider private equity transactions that involve U.S. firms as buyout targets. Our analysis relies on a unique new dataset that combines information on private equity transactions from CapitallQ and other sources with establishment-level and firm-level data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and Annual Surveys and Censuses of Manufactures (ASM and CM). The linkage is accomplished by matching name and address information for target firms in private equity buyout transactions to name and address data of their establishments in the Census Bureau's Business Register (BR). The BR, LBD, ASM and CM all contain common identifiers that facilitate easy linking of establishment and firm data across each source. We use the LBD to follow target firms and their establishments over time, obtaining annual observations. We also use the BR and LBD to identify controls (comparable firms and establishments) and follow them over time as well. Our productivity analysis involves additional matching to observations in the CM and ASM.  \n\nThe LBD tracks establishments and their parent firms using a combination of administrative records and survey collections that include the Company Organization Survey (COs), the Economic Censuses and the Annual Surveys of Businesses (e.g., the ASM). Information about the company structure is incorporated in the LBD by attaching firm identifiers to records for establishments (physical locations where economic activity occurs). Ownership changes are identified when establishments switch parent firm through mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.  \n\nThe Census Bureau assigns a unique firm ID to all the establishments under common ownership and control in a given year, including establishments that belong to subsidiaries under control of the parent corporation. This firm ID is distinct from a taxpayer ID such as the employer identification number (EIN). The relationships among the various IDs are as follows. In any given year, an establishment is uniquely associated with a single taxpayer ID and a single firm ID. Moreover, each taxpayer ID is uniquely associated with a firm ID. In the case of multi-establishment firms, a parent firm ID has multiple affiliated establishment IDs and potentially multiple EINs. Put differently, the EIN as a unit of observation is somewhere between an establishment and a firm.  \n\nTo match deals and target firms in the Capital IQ data to the Census Business Register, our main method works as follows. First, we use name and address information in the two data sources to match a particular deal to a specific unit in the BR. Because the matching algorithm relies partly on address information, this step identifies a specific matched establishment owned by the target firm - often but not always a headquarters facility. In a second step, we use the BR link between that establishment's ID and its firm ID to identify the target firm in the BR. In most cases, this method accurately identifies the target firm in the BR and all of its activity.  \n\nFor divisional buyouts, we could not always identify the correct target firm in the BR after matching the deal to a specific establishment. These instances arose because, in some cases, the Census firm ID associated with the matched establishments did not change to reflect the  \n\n# For Online Posting; Not Intended for Publication  \n\nownership change of the division or subsidiary involved in the deal. We identified these problematic cases by observing that the matched target establishment remained affiliated with the parent seller firm even after the transaction. It is our understanding that the Census Bureau on occasion had difficulty tracking the new firm in divisional buyouts because of nonresponse on the COS or other survey instruments. In considering these cases, it is important to note that the BR still accurately tracks the activity of the target establishments over time.  \n\nWe thus had two types of divisional cases. The first are those where we could accurately identify the target firm using our main method. The second are those where we could not accurately identify the target firm using our main method. Even in those cases, we were able to link the matched establishment to at least a part of the target firm through the EIN (taxpayer ID). The complete target firm may or may not be identified in such cases, because the divisional business involved in the buyout may have operated with multiple EINs. In the main text and this appendix, we refer to such cases as EIN cases. In these EIN cases, we can accurately identify a part of the target firm in the transaction year and at least some of the corresponding target establishments.  \n\nGiven the presence of EIN cases in our matched data samples, we proceed as follows. In the establishment-level analysis that tracks the pre and post outcomes of target and control establishments, we use both firm ID cases based on our main method and EIN cases. Longitudinal establishment links in the BR allow us to track the pre and post outcomes regardless of ownership, so the inclusion of EIN cases involves no issues for our establishmentlevel analysis.  \n\nWe exclude the EIN cases in the firm-level analysis, because the EIN is not suitable for tracking firms over time. For example, a target firm that adds a new establishment may obtain a new EIN for that establishment for accounting or tax reasons. Table 2 in the main text reports statistics for the EIN cases in the sample for the 1980-2003 period. There are 391 EIN cases over this period out of a total of 2265 target firms.  \n\nTo check the sensitivity of our results to the EIN cases, we repeated the establishment-level analysis in Section 5 of the main text for the subsample that excludes the EIN cases. Figures A.1 to A.3 and Table A.1 below report the results. In all cases, they are quite similar to those reported in the main text. We conclude that omission of the 391 EIN cases is unlikely to cause a serious bias in the firm-level analyses reported in the main text.  \n\nWe also encountered other matching problems when integrating the Census Business Register and Capital IQ data. In a few case cases where we retimed the transaction forward, we could not accurately identify the target firm in the forward year. These 16 cases are excluded from our analysis.  \n\n# For Online Posting; Not Intended for Publication  \n\n![](images/cbc2c5373c16d15458ad608b36e2c9f0cfa62125e9486fa4fb1e561ad03f8a0d.jpg)  \nFigure A.1A: Comparison of Employment Trajectory for Target Establishments to Controls, Buyouts from 1980 to 2000, Excluding EIN Cases  \n\n![](images/d12ee9665f5e8b5558c9063e58a1cfd21f860842aa496d3d653452ae809c68f4.jpg)  \nFigure A.1B: Employment Growth Rate Differences before and after the Buyout Year, Target Establishments Minus Controls, Buyouts from 1980 to 2000, Excluding EIN Cases  \n\n# For Online Posting; Not Intended for Publication  \n\n![](images/b9802e66aa8ef08fd300c0c9f1875ad47d974727ef6742891363997d80c31828.jpg)  \nFigure A.2A: Job Creation Rates before and after Buyout Year, Target Establishments Minus Controls, Buyouts from 1980 to 2000, Excluding EIN Cases  \n\n![](images/73eb6706905179e930411402854ed56b50ce0c6dffbb24309cf280cb17ed6d02.jpg)  \nFigure A.2B: Job Destruction Rates before and after Buyout Year, Target Establishments Minus Controls, Buyouts from 1980 to 2000, Excluding EIN Cases  \n\n![](images/44b0954614d68de325da0a2451032d9cb2af8610931bec77aec29060767c718d.jpg)  \nFigure A.3: Employment-Weighted Establishment Exit Rates Post Buyout, Targets Minus Controls, Buyouts from 1980 to 2000, Excluding EIN Cases  \n\nTable A.1 Post-Buyout Employment Growth Rates at Target Establishments Relative to Controls, Buyouts from 1980 to 2000, Excluding EIN cases.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td rowspan=\"2\">Non-Parametric Comparison From Figure A.1B</td><td colspan=\"2\">Regression Approaches</td></tr><tr><td>ATE=ATE1</td><td>ATE1 Heterogeneous</td></tr><tr><td>Buyout Year</td><td>2.59</td><td>2.75</td><td>2.97</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.18)</td><td>(0.19)</td></tr><tr><td>Buyout Year +1</td><td>-0.67</td><td>-0.45</td><td>-0.94</td></tr><tr><td>+2</td><td>-1.94</td><td>(0.21) -1.39</td><td>(0.21) -1.44</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.22)</td><td>(0.22)</td></tr><tr><td>+3</td><td>-0.60</td><td>-0.09</td><td>-0.01</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.22)</td><td>(0.23)</td></tr><tr><td>+4</td><td>-0.45</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.23)</td><td>(0.23)</td></tr><tr><td>+5</td><td>-1.33</td><td>-1.32</td><td>-1.55</td></tr><tr><td>Cumulative, Years 1 to 5</td><td>-4.99</td><td>(0.24) -3.13</td><td>(0.24) -3.69</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNotes:  \n\n1.

Semi-Parametric Regression Specifications and Supplemental Results Referenced in Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Main Text  \n\nTable 3, 4 and 5 report results for two types of semi-parametric regression specifications: an ATE $\\equiv$ ATE1 specification that imposes uniform treatment effects and an ATE1 Heterogeneous specification that allows treatment effects to vary by firm size, firm age and our two measures of pre-buyout growth history.  \n\nTheATE $\\begin{array}{r}{{\\bf\\Pi}={\\bf\\Pi}}\\ {{\\bf\\Pi}}\\end{array}.$ ATE1 specification can be written  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{Y_{i,t+j}=\\alpha_{j}+\\sum_{c}D_{c i t}\\theta_{c,j}+\\lambda_{o,j}L F I R M_{i t}+\\lambda_{1,j}L E S T_{i t}+\\gamma_{j}P E_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t+j},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y_{i t}$ is the outcome variable (e.g,. rate of growth, job creation, or job destruction) for firm $i$ at time $t{+}j$ for some $j\\in\\{-5,-4,...,0,...4,5\\}$ ， $D_{c i t}$ is a set of dummy variables for cell $c$ for firm $i$ at time $t$ where the cells are defined in by the full cross product of buyout year $t$ , industry, firm size category, firm age category and multi-unit status, $L F I R M_{i t}$ is the growth rate from $t{-}3$ to $t{-}I$ of the parent firm as of t-3, $L E S T_{i t}$ is the growth rate from $t{-}3$ to $t{-}I$ for the establishments that constitute the target firm in year $t$ and $P E_{i t}$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 for a target firm.  \n\nThe ATE1 Heterogeneous specification is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\displaystyle Y_{i,t+j}=\\alpha_{j}+\\sum_{c}D_{c i t}\\theta_{c,j}+\\lambda_{o,j}L F I R M_{i t}+\\lambda_{1,j}L E S T_{i t}}&{{}}\\ {+\\displaystyle\\sum_{k}D_{k i t}P E_{i t}\\gamma_{k,j}+\\gamma_{o,j}L F I R M_{i t}P E_{i t}+\\gamma_{1,j}L E S T_{i t}P E_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i,t+j}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAll variables are defined as above, but the ATE1 heterogeneous specification allows the treatment effect to vary by characteristics including a set of cell-based variables $k$ (in practice by firm size and by firm age - not interacted) and the lagged growth terms. To recover the average treatment effect on the treated in this case, we compute a weighted average of the heterogeneous estimated treatment effects, using cell-level employment weights of targets in the buyout year. We calculate standard errors by the Delta method.  \n\nAs remarked in Section 5 of the main text, employment expands at target and control establishments before the buyout year, and it shrinks at both sets of establishments after the buyout. This pattern is evident in Figure C.1 below.  \n\nTables C.1 and C.2 provide additional information related to Table 6 of Section 6. Figures C.2 and C.3 and Table C.3 report results referenced in Section 6.D in the main text. Figure C.2 shows that target-control employment growth rate differences are negative for buyouts that took place in the 1980s, from 1990 to 94, and from 1995 to 2000. Figure C.3 shows the evolution of target-control employment growth rate differences before and after buyouts from 1980 to 2000 in three major industry sectors: Manufacturing, Retail Trade, and Services.

Panel A reports results by type of buyout, and Panel B reports results by industry for industries with large numbers of buyouts. In Panel B we assign establishments to the industry of its parent firm, defined by the model industry of the establishments operated by that firm. We exclude single-unit firms and firms that exit in the first two years post buyout. These sample selection criteria have little impact on the results, because target firms are predominantly multi-unit continuers.  "
