TOWNSEND\\*  \n\n## ABSTRACT  \n\nWe show that venture capitalists’ (VCs) on-site involvement with their portfolio companies leads to an increase in (1) innovation and (2) the likelihood of a successful exit. We rule out selection effects by exploiting an exogenous source of variation in VC involvement: the introduction of new airline routes that reduce VCs’ travel times to their ecisting portfolio companies. We confirm the importance of this channel by conducting a large-scale survey of VCs, of whom almost 90% indicate that direct fights increase their interaction with their portfolio companies and management, and help them better understand companies' activities.  \n\nIt is often argued that venture capital (VC) plays an important role in promoting innovation and growth. Consistent with this belief, governments around the world have pursued a number of policies aimed at fostering VC activity (Lerner, 2009). However, there remains scarce evidence that the activities of venture capitalists actually play a causal role in stimulating the creation of innovative and successful companies. Indeed, VCs may simply select companies that are poised to innovate and succeed, even absent their involvement. In this paper, we examine whether the activities of VCs do affect portfolio company outcomes.  \n\nAn ideal experiment to establish the impact of VCs would be to randomly provide certain companies with VC funding and others not. Such an experiment would eliminate the selection of companies (\\*screening\"), thus allowing us to estimate the effect of VC involvement (\\*monitoring\").1 Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to find a setting that convincingly approximates this experiment. That being said, another useful experiment would be to instead randomly vary VC involvement after initial investments are made. This would allow us to identify the effect of VC involvement, holding company selection fixed. In particular, if diferences in outcomes for VC-backed companies are driven purely by selection, post-investment involvement of the VCs should have no effect. In this paper, we attempt to approximate this second experiment.  \n\nThe source of exogenous variation in VC involvement that we exploit is the introduction of new airline routes that reduce the travel time between VC firms and their existing portfolio companies. Previous work suggests that travel time reductions lower monitoring costs for firms with headquarters that are geographically separated from their production facilities (Giroud, 2013). If VC activities do matter, reductions in the cost of monitoring should translate into better portfolio company performance by allowing VCs to engage in more of these activities.  \n\nTo obtain direct evidence on whether VC involvement increases following reductions in travel   \ntime, we conduct a large-scale survey of VC investors. Almost 90% of the 306 survey participants   \nagreed that they would visit a portfolio company more frequently following the introduction of a   \ndirect fight. Survey participants also agreed that the introduction of a direct flight would help them 1Kaplan and Stromberg (2001) review the screening and monitoring roles of VCs, and emphasize the dificulty of  \n\nestablish better relationships with management teams, better understand the state of their companies, and generally add more value. This qualitative evidence supports our underlying assumption that VC involvement is responsive to the introduction of direct fights, and is consistent with the academic literature that shows that VC activity is sensitive to geographic proximity.2  \n\nWe then explore how the introduction of new airline routes that reduce the travel time between VCs and their portfolio companies affect company-level outcomes. The primary outcomes we examine are the quantity and quality of innovation (as measured by the patent count and citations per patent, respectively), as well as success (as measured by exit via IPO or acquisition). Using a difference-in-differences estimation framework, we find that the introduction of a new airline route leads to a $3.1\\%$ increase in the number of patents the portfolio company produces and a 5.8% increase in the number of citations per patent it receives. Furthermore, the treatment increases the probability of going public by 1.0%, and of having a successful exit (via IPO or acquisition) by $1.4\\%$ . These results indicate that VC involvement is an important determinant of innovation and success.  \n\nA natural concern is that local shocks, in the region of either the VC or the portfolio company, could be driving the results. For example, a booming local economy may lead to both increased innovation and the introduction of a new airline route. In this case, we may estimate a spurious positive effect of travel time reductions on innovation. However, since our treatment is defined at the VC-company pair level, we can control for such local shocks. Specifically, we include two full sets of MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) by year fixed effects for the MSAs of both the VC and the portfolio company. Moreover, we find that pre-existing trends are not driving our results, and the results are robust to considering only new airline routes that are the outcome of a merger between two airlines or the opening of a new hub. Such treatments are likely to be even more exogenous to any given VC-company pair.  \n\nWe provide further evidence on the underlying channel through which these effects operate by taking advantage of the fact that certain VCs should be more sensitive to changes in monitoring costs than others. Specifically, VCs often syndicate their investments, and when this occurs, one typically takes the role of the lead investor. The lead investor is generally more actively involved in the monitoring of the portfolio company, while others act more as passive providers of capital (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989). Given that lead VCs play a greater role in monitoring, their monitoring effort should be more sensitive to reductions in monitoring costs, as should portfolio company performance. Indeed, we find that our results are driven primarily by reductions in travel time for lead VCs rather than other members of the investment syndicate.  \n\nOur paper contributes to a growing literature that studies the effect of VCs on portfolio company outcomes. Much of this literature tries to disentangle VC monitoring from screening by comparing outcomes of VC-backed and non-VC-backed companies (e.g., Hellmann and Puri, 2000; Chemmanur et al., 201la; Hellmann and Puri, 2002; Puri and Zarutskie, 2012). These papers are valuable given the scarcity of data on young companies that are not affliated with a VC. However, even if both groups of companies are matched on the basis of observables, it is quite plausible that VCs select companies with higher potential ex ante—an inherently unobservable characteristic. In contrast, our setting allows us to identify the effect of VC monitoring holding selection fixed, because we exploit exogenous reductions in monitoring costs after initial investments are made. Other papers rely on structural modeling. In particular, Sorensen (2007) models the two-sided matching process of VCs and entrepreneurs to structurally estimate the relative importance of VC monitoring and screening as explanations for why companies backed by more experienced VCs outperform. Relatedly, Kortum and Lerner (2000) structurally estimate industry-level patent production functions with corporate R&D and venture capital as inputs in order to compare their relative potency. Our paper differs from these in that it does not require any structural assumptions for identification.  \n\nOur paper also contributes to a large, mostly theoretical literature that explores how financial contracts shape the interaction between entrepreneurs and VC firms, alleviating moral hazard and agency problems. For example, several papers consider the optimal contractual arrangement that leads both entrepreneurs and VCs to contribute effort to promote a venture's success in a double moral hazard setting (e.g., Schmidt, 2003; Casamatta, 2003; Inderst and Mueller, 2004; Hellmann, 2006). Other theoretical work highlights the importance of contractual arrangements on the VC refinancing versus termination decision (e.g., Repullo and Suarez, 2004; Dessi, 2005; Cornelli and Yosha, 2003), as well as the effective allocation of control (e.g., Berglof, 1994; Cestone, 2014). Kaplan and Stromberg (2003; 2004) provide empirical evidence on such contractual arrangements.3 Our paper complements this literature by highlighting the role of geographic proximity, in addition to contracts, in shaping the interactions between entrepreneurs and VC frms.  \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section I discusses the data and key variables. Section II discusses our empirical strategy. Section IHI presents the survey. Section IV presents the results, and Section V concludes.  \n\n## I. Data  \n\n### A. Data Sources and Sample Selection  \n\nWe obtain data on venture-backed companies from the Thomson Reuters VentureXpert database (formerly called Venture Economics). VentureXpert, along with Dow Jones’ VentureSource (formerly VentureOne), are the two primary venture capital data sources available. Both have been validated by previous researchers against known financing rounds (Kaplan et al., 2002). We choose to use VentureXpert because VentureSource starts later and is less comprehensive in earlier years, when many new airline routes were introduced. VentureXpert began compiling data in 1977. It contains detailed information about the dates of venture financing rounds, the investors and portfolio companies involved, the estimated amounts invested by each party, and the ultimate portfolio company outcome. The database also contains detailed information on the location of each VC firm and portfolio company. It should be noted that one shortcoming of these data for our purposes is that VentureXpert only associates a VC frm with a single location (its main office). However, some of the larger VC firms operate out of multiple offices. While ideally we would observe all of these offices, this should not present a systematic source of bias.4 Similarly, we only observe one headquarter location per portfolio company, despite the fact that portfolio companies can potentially move. The location we observe represents the company's latest known address. Again, this should not present a systematic source of bias. We limit the sample to U.S.-based portfolio companies coded as being in a venture stage (seed, early, expansion, or later stage) in their first observed financing round. For our baseline analysis, we further restrict the sample to only VC-company pairs involving the lead investor, which will be defined in Section I.B.3. In subsequent analysis, we examine whether the results hold for non-lead investors as well.  \n\nTo measure the innovative output of portfolio companies, we combine VentureXpert with data from the NBER Patent Data Project (Hall et al., 2001). The NBER data cover all utility patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from 1976 to 2006.5 Among other things, the data provide information on the date a patent was applied for and ultimately granted as well as its detailed technology class. If a patent was assigned to one or more companies (\"assignees\"), the data also provide information on assignee name(s)/location(s). We match the NBER data with VentureXpert using standardized company and location names along with the company's founding date and the date of the assignee's frst patent application. The details of the matching procedure are provided in Section II of the Internet Appendix. Finally, we also supplement the NBER data with citation data from Google patents in some cases so that we can observe citations in a three-year window following the grant date for all patents, including those at the end of the NBER sample in 2006.  \n\nData on airline routes are obtained from the T-100 Domestic Segment Database (for the period 1990 to 2006) and ER-586 Service Segment Data (for the period 1977 to 1989), which are compiled from Form 41 of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). All airlines operating fights in the U.S. are required by law to file Form 41 with the DOT and are subject to fines for misreporting.  \n\nStrictly speaking, the T-100 and ER-586 are not samples: they include all fights that have taken place between any two airports in the U.S. The T-100 and ER-586 contain monthly data for each airline and route (segment). The data include, for example, the origin and destination airports, fight duration (ramp-to-ramp time), scheduled departures, performed departures, enplaned passengers, and aircraft type.  \n\nAfter combining these three data sources, we are left with a sample of venture-backed companies that were active between 1977 (the beginning of the airline data) and 2006 (the end of the patent data). In total, we observe 22,986 companies, receiving funding from 3,158 lead VC frms. Table I shows the composition of the sample. Panel A shows the company region distribution broken down according to whether the company was ever treated or not (i.e., experienced a reduction in travel time to its lead VC). Similarly, Panel C shows the VC region distribution broken down according to whether the venture firm was ever part of a treatment or not. Perhaps the most striking finding from these tables is that, contrary to common perception, a significant amount of venture capital activity takes place outside of Northern California, New England, and New York. Indeed, approximately 50% of venture-backed companies and VC firms are located outside of these three regions. This is consistent with the findings of Chen et al. (2010). Overall, treated and untreated companies are distributed similarly across regions; however, as one might expect, treated companies are less likely to be located in Northern California. Similarly, Panel C shows that VCs that are part of a treatment are also less likely to be located in Northern California. Finally, Panel B shows that treated and untreated companies are also distributed similarly across industries, although treated companies are somewhat less likely to be in the Internet sector.  \n\nWhile Table I shows that both portfolio companies and VC frms are fairly dispersed geographically, it does not directly show whether it is common for VCs to invest in distant portfolio companies. If, to a first approximation, all VCs invested locally, we would not have sufficient power to identify an effect, since there would be few reductions in travel time due to new airline routes. Figure 1 provides some perspective on the distance between VCs and portfolio companies graphically. First, it shows the distribution of portfolio companies across states, depicting states with more companies in darker shades. More interestingly, the height of the bar over each state indicates the percentage of companies located in that state, which are funded by a lead VC from the same state. As can be seen, many states have a relatively low percentage of locally funded portfolio companies. Thus, airline routes could potentially be an important determinant of monitoring costs for many companies. To examine this issue more directly still, we plot the cumulative density function of the VC-company distance distribution in Figure 2. Consistent with what one might expect, we find that a large fraction of VC investments are local, with around 30% being located close to zero miles from their lead VC. However, the median distance between a portfolio company and its lead VC is approximately 200 miles and the 60th percentile is approximately 500 miles. Thus, around 40% of portfolio companies are located more than 500 miles from their lead VC. This both suggests that we will likely have enough power to identify an effect if one is present, and that the long-distance pairs that we use for identification are not particularly unusual.  \n\n### $B$ :Definitions of Variables  \n\n#### B.1. Treatment  \n\nTo estimate the effect of reductions in travel time on portfolio company outcomes, we define a treatment indicator variable equal to one if a new airline route is introduced that reduces the travel time between the VC firm and the portfolio company. Travel time is estimated as the time it would take to travel from the VC's ZIP code to the company's ZIP code using the optimal itinerary and means of transportation (car or airplane). The details of the algorithm used to compute optimal itineraries and travel times are described in Section IHI of the Internet Appendix. During our sample period (1977 to 2006), there are 1,131 treated VC-company pairs. The average travel time reduction is 126 minutes round-trip. Note, however, that this estimated reduction in travel time is likely a lower bound as it does not take into account the compounding probability of delays and cancellations when taking indirect fights. Moreover, a 126-minute travel time reduction could mean the difference between being able to fy back on the same day versus having to stay overnight.6  \n\n#### B.2. Innovation  \n\nWe use patent-based measures of the scale and quality of a company's innovation (Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 2002; Lanjouw et al., 1998). These measures have been widely adopted over the past two decades.7 Our primary measure of the scale of a company's innovation during a year is the number of (eventually granted) patents it applied for. Our primary measure of the quality of a company's innovation during a year is the number of citations it received per patent. Patent citations are important in patent filings since they serve as “property markers\"’ delineating the scope of the granted claims. Hall et al. (2005) illustrate that citations are a good measure of innovation quality and economic importance. Specifically, they find that an extra citation per patent boosts a firm's market value by 3%. Moreover, Kogan et al. (2012) show that the stock market reaction to patent approvals is a strong predictor of the number of future citations a patent receives.  \n\nOne challenge in measuring patent citations is that patents granted at the end of the sample period have less time to garner citations than those granted at the beginning. To address this issue, we only consider citations that occur during a three-year window following the date a patent is granted. In addition, we check that our results are robust to correcting for truncation using the estimated shape of the citation-lag distribution as in Hall et al. (2001). An additional consideration is that citation rates vary over time and across technologies. To ensure this does not affect our results, we also explore scaling each patent's citation count by the average citation count for patents granted in the same year and technology class. Finally, we take logs and add one to both the patent count and citation variables.  \n\n#### B.3. Other Variables  \n\nIn addition to innovation, we also measure success annually. We define company success in two ways. The frst is an indicator variable equal to one if the company went public during a given year. The second is an indicator variable equal to one if the company went public or was acquired. The issue with the second definition is that it may capture some acquisitions that were not positive outcomes. Specifically, an acquisition may be a sell-off that was not very profitable for the company's investors or founders. Indeed, Metrick and Yasuda (2011) find that first-round (second-round) investors do not even recover their invested capital in 38% (46%) of acquisitions. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, we cannot calculate gross value multiples analogously. Therefore, to ensure that we only count significant acquisitions as positive outcomes, we obtain acquisition values from SDC Platinum and CapitalIQ.8 We then include only acquisitions at values over \\$25M (in 2000 dollars) in our success measure.  \n\nFinally, as previously mentioned, in our baseline analysis, we limit the sample to only VCcompany pairs involving the lead investor. We focus on the lead investor because it is likely to be the one most involved in monitoring. Following Gompers (1996), we define the lead investor as the one that has invested in the company the longest.9 This is also consistent with Gorman and Sahlman's (1989) finding that the venture firm originating the investment is usually the frm that acquires a board seat first and has the most input into the decisions of the company, even though it might not end up ultimately owning the largest equity stake. Our results are also robust to other commonly used definitions of the lead investor, such as the investor that invested the most in a given round.  \n\n## II. Methodology  \n\nNew airline routes that reduce the travel time between VC firms and their portfolio companies make it easier for VCs to spend time at their portfolio companies.10 If VC activities do matter, such reduction in travel time should translate into better portfolio company performance by allowing VCs to engage in more of these activities. To estimate the effect of the introduction of new airline routes (\"treatments\") on company outcomes, we adopt a difference-in-differences methodology similar to Giroud (2013). Specifically, we estimate the following regression:  \n\n$$\ny_{i j t}=\\beta\\times t r e a t m e n t_{i j t}+\\gamma^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X_{ijt}}+\\alpha_{i j}+\\alpha_{M S A(i)}\\times\\alpha_{t}+\\alpha_{M S A(j)}\\times\\alpha_{t}+\\epsilon_{i j t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $i$ indexes portfolio companies, $j$ indexes VC frms, $t$ indexes years, $M S A(i)$ indexes the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which portfolio company $i$ is located, and $M S A(j)$ indexes the MSA in which VC $j$ is located; $y$ is the dependent variable of interest (e.g., number of patents, citations per patent, IPO), treatment is an indicator variable (\"treatment indicator') that equals one if a new airline route that reduces the travel time between company $i$ 's ZIP code and VC $j$ 's ZIP code has been introduced by year $t$ .， $\\mathbf{X}$ is the vector of control variables, which includes company age (the number of days since the first round of financing) and company stage of development (a set of indicator variables for the 8-point stage classification used by VentureXpert); $\\alpha_{i j}$ are VC-company pair fixed effects; $\\alpha_{M S A(i)}\\times\\alpha_{t}$ and $\\alpha_{M S A(j)}\\times\\alpha_{t}$ are MSA by year fixed effects with respect to company $\\imath$ 's MSA and VC $j$ 's MSA, respectively; $\\epsilon$ is the error term. This methodology fully controls for fixed differences between treated and non-treated VC-company pairs via the inclusion of pair fixed effects. The inclusion of MSA by year fixed effects further accounts for local shocks that may correlate with the introduction of new airline routes. To allow for serial dependence of the error terms, we cluster standard errors at the portfolio company level. The coefficient of interest is $\\beta$ which measures the effect of the introduction of new airline routes on $y$  \n\nOur identification strategy can be illustrated with a simple example. From 1986 to 1994, Anesta Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company located in Salt Lake City, UT, was receiving VC funding from Flagship Ventures, a VC firm in Cambridge, MA. Until 1988, the fastest way to travel between Boston Logan Airport (BOS) and Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) was an indirect fight operated by Delta Airlines with one stopover at Chicago O'Hare (ORD). In 1988, Delta introduced a direct fight between BOS and SLC, which substantially reduced the travel time between the two locations. To measure how this “treatment\" affects, for example, the number of patents filed by Anesta, one could compute the difference in the number of patents before and after 1988. However, other events may have occurred around 1988, which may also have affected patenting. To account for this possibility, we use a control group that consists of all VC-company pairs that have not been treated by 1988. We then compare the difference in the number of patents at Anesta before and after 1988 with the difference in the number of patents at the control companies before and after 1988. The difference between these two differences is the estimated effect of the treatment on patenting at Anesta.  \n\n### $A$ Local Shocks  \n\nIncluding a control group accounts for the possibility of economy-wide shocks that are contemporaneous with the introduction of the new airline routes. However, since a treatment is defined at the VC-company level, we can tighten the identification by also controlling for local shocks in the portfolio company's MSA, thereby separating out the effect of the new airline routes from the effect of contemporaneous local shocks. For example, Systemed Inc. is another biopharmaceutical company located in Salt Lake City. Around 1988, Systemed was receiving VC funding from Summit Capital Associates, a New York-based VC. (Direct flights between New York's John F. Kennedy Airport and SLC were offered in each year during our sample.) If patenting at Systemed also increases around 1988, then an increase in patenting at Anesta might not be due to the new airline route between BOS and SLC, but rather due to a contemporaneous local shock that affects patenting in the Salt Lake City MSA. In Equation (1), we control for such local shocks by including the full set of MSA fixed effects (pertaining to the portfolio company's location) interacted with year fixed efets $(\\alpha_{M S A(i)}\\times\\alpha_{t})$  \n\nIn addition, since a treatment is defined at the VC-company level, we can make the identification even tighter by also controlling for shocks at the location of the VC firm. In the above example, suppose there is a local shock that affects patenting in Boston in 1988. This local shock may affect Flagship Ventures, the Cambridge VC financing Anesta, and in turn Anesta's ability to innovate. In this case, however, patenting should also increase in the Boston area. In Equation (1), we control for such local shocks by including MSA fixed effects (pertaining to the VC's location) interacted with year fixed effects $(\\alpha_{M S A(j)}\\times\\alpha_{t})$ 12  \n\n### $B$ :Pair-Specific Shocks  \n\nOne potential concern that is not addressed by controlling for local shocks, is the possibility that a pair-specific shock (i.e., a shock that is specific to a VC-company pair, but not to the MSA of the company, or the MSA of the VC) is driving both company-level outcomes (e.g., patenting) and the introduction of the new airline route. For example, it could be that a portfolio company that is successful in patenting becomes more salient to its VC. In response, the VC may want to spend more time at that company and hence may lobby for better airline connections to the company's location. Nevertheless, such alternative stories are unlikely for several reasons. First, portfolio companies and VC frms are relatively small business entities. Hence, it seems unlikely that a VC-company pair is sufficiently powerful to successfully lobby for better airline connections (or that an airline would introduce a new route in response to a shock to that pair). To further rule out this concern, we have verified that our results also hold if we restrict our sample to portfolio companies and VC frms whose size is below the median in our sample, that is, those companies and VCs that are even less able to successfully lobby for a new airline route. Second, we examine the dynamic effects of the treatment. Arguably, if the new airline routes are introduced in response to pair-specific shocks, one may already observe an “effect'’ of the new airline routes before they are even introduced. However, when we examine the dynamics of the treatment, we find no such evidence: most of the effects we observe occur between 12 and 24 months after the introduction of the new airline routes. Third, in robustness checks, we show that our results also hold if we consider new airline routes that are introduced as part of the opening of a new hub or a merger between two airlines. Arguably, it is unlikely that a shock that is specific to a VC-company pair is sufficiently large to lead to a hub opening or an airline merger.  \n\n### $C$ Differences between Treated and Non-Treated Pairs  \n\nIn order to be treated, a VC-company pair needs to be sufficiently far apart so that air travel is the optimal means of transportation between the two. Thus, by construction, treated pairs are farther apart than the average VC-company pair in the U.S. This is confirmed by looking at the summary statistics in Table II. On average, treated pairs are located approximately 500 miles farther away than non-treated pairs. The other characteristics shown in the table further indicate that, for treated pairs, portfolio companies receive less funding, are less innovative, and tend to receive funding from VCs that are more experienced and more diversified.  \n\nWhile these difrences may be intuitive, they do raise the concern of whether our control group is an appropriate one. Nevertheless, this concern is minimized for several reasons. First, in all our regressions, we include VC-company pair fixed effects, which fully controls for any fixed differences between treated and non-treated VC-company pairs. Since the main difference—the distance between VC and portfolio company—is a fixed characteristic, it seems likely that most of the relevant differences between the two groups are absorbed away. Second, because of the staggered introduction of the new airline routes over time, the eventually treated pairs are both control and treatment pairs (i.e., they remain in the control group until they become treated). Third, we show that our results are robust if we restrict the control group to those control pairs whose average distance matches the average distance in the treatment group. Fourth, we show that our results also hold if we allow pairs that differ on the basis of the characteristics in Table II to be on different time trends. More precisely, this test is conducted by including as additional controls the characteristics in Table I interacted with a full set of year fixed effects (see Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) for a similar robustness check).  \n\nFinally, another helpful robustness check proposed by Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) consists of estimating the difference-in-differences specification using only observations of the eventually treated pairs— essentially, due to the staggered introduction of the new airline routes, Equation (1) can be estimated using only this subsample (in this case, the control group consists exclusively of pairs that are subsequently treated). Again, we show that our results are robust if we perform this test.  \n\n## III. Survey of VCs  \n\nThe key assumption underlying our empirical strategy is that VCs are responsive to the treatment, i.e., VC involvement increases following a reduction in travel time. Since VC involvement is not observable, we cannot directly test this assumption. Instead, to assess the plausibility of this assumption, we conduct a large-scale survey of VCs.  \n\nSurveying VC investors is dificult because these investors are time constrained and also notoriously reluctant to provide data on their operations. In order to increase the likelihood of participation, we limited our survey population to alumni from our respective academic institutions (Stanford, MIT, and Dartmouth). In total, we identified 2,109 alumni with current or past VC experience. We distributed the survey electronically to these alumni and obtained 306 responses (corresponding to a response rate of $14.5\\%$ ).13  \n\nAs is typically the case with VC surveys, our sample is unlikely to be perfectly representative of the VC universe. Nonetheless, we see no reason to believe that the sample should be biased toward  \n\nVCs whose monitoring is more sensitive to travel time reductions. The average assets under management (AUM) of the VC firms of survey participants was $\\$1.2$ billion (median \\$448 million).14 For comparison, the average assets under management of VC firms as reported by Thomson Reuters is $\\S$ 213 million. This difference refects the large representation of top VC firms in our survey. Panel A of Table IHI illustrates the geographical distribution of the survey participants. Approximately 20% were located outside the U.S. The most strongly represented international locations were Germany, Brazil, and China. Within the U.S., there was a clear bias toward California, which accounted for 70% of the participants. As expected, other prominent locations were Massachusetts and New York.  \n\nPanel B of Table III shows that 77% of the survey participants were partners at their VC firms. The average portfolio size among the respondents was 6.58 companies (median 5), and an average of 3.79 of these companies were local (median 3). A local company was defined as a company within 50 miles of the investor. The average number of visits to a given portfolio company was 9.93 per year (median 6). Interestingly, the survey participants reported that they spend 48% of their time monitoring and assisting portfolio companies. Moreover, 71% reported that they tend to visit local companies more than non-local companies, suggesting that proximity affects their level of involvement with a company. We explored this hypothesis more directly in the remainder of the survey.  \n\nA common issue in survey design is the possibility of social desirability bias (SDB). This refers to the tendency of research participants to present themselves in a positive or socially acceptable way (Maccoby and Maccoby, 1954). In the context of our survey, an important concern is that SDB may lead participants to be hesitant in revealing the effect of direct fights on their level of monitoring. Indeed, admitting that direct fights matter could suggest that respondents do not provide sufficient monitoring and assistance to distant companies. Rather, respondents might want to portray themselves as “always doing whatever is necessary to help their portfolio companies regardless of other factors.\"  \n\nVCs may want to portray themselves in this way to maintain a positive image in their own mind, or in the minds of others they imagine may get access to the survey results. Indeed, several VCs that we consulted when designing the survey independently brought up the concern that respondents may not be truthful for this reason. To help elicit truthful responses, we administered the survey in an anonymous manner and informed the participants that their identity could not be linked with their response. However, past research shows that anonymizing surveys has somewhat limited effectiveness in reducing SDB (Dillman et al., 1996; Singer et al., 1995). In our case, participants may worry that the online survey platform that we utilized does not completely strip identifying information (e.g., IP address) from their response. Therefore, in addition to anonymization, we also used the well-known technique of “indirect questioning” to further mitigate the possibility of SDB (Haire, 1950; Calder and Burnkrant, 1977; Anderson, 1978).  \n\nSpecifically, in our first set of key questions, rather than asking research participants about their own behavior, we asked about their beliefs about general VC behavior. While this approach has been shown to mitigate SDB, one may be concerned that VCs incorrectly perceive the sensitivity of others to reductions in travel time. Therefore, we also asked a second set of key questions regarding VCs? own behavior, recognizing that responses in this case may be more affected by SDB. For the second set of questions, we described a situation in which an indirect fight (Seattle to Raleigh-Durham via Chicago) is replaced by a non-stop fight. 15  \n\nFinally, according to survey design conventions, key questions are generally asked in a variety of different but closely related ways. Among other things, this helps ensure that the results are not driven by participants misunderstanding a single question. This is also helpful to better understand the mechanism through which direct fights improve VC involvement with portfolio companies. Therefore, for both our general and specific questions, we asked several variations related to different dimensions along which direct fights may matter. That being said, our main interest is in whether VCs report that they are likely to spend more time at a company in person if a direct fight is introduced.  \n\nOn all questions, participants were asked to state their degree of agreement with various statements about the effect of direct fights on VCs. We used a standard 6-point Likert scale, where potential responses ranged from Strongly Disagree ( $=1$ )toStrongly Agree( $=6$ ). We note that it is not clear what percentage of respondents would need to agree with these statements for our survey results to be consistent with our main empirical results. For example, if 30% of VCs become more involved when a direct fight is introduced, that may be enough for us to find a statistically significant effect on average. However, this point is largely irrelevant, as we find that a large majority of respondents agreed with all of the statements presented.  \n\nPanel C of Table IHI summarizes the responses to our general questions. The precise wording of the questions is shown in Section VI of the Internet Appendix. In terms of the main question, 86% of respondents agreed that direct fights between VCs and portfolio companies increase the time VCs spend at companies in person, with a mean response of 4.43 out of 6. The mean response was also statistically different from the neutral mid-point response of 3.5 at the 1% significance levels. We find that over 80% agreed with all of the remaining questions of the general variety and that the mean response was significantly non-neutral. For example, 83% agreed that direct fights allow VCs to more effectively advise companies, and 80% agreed that direct fights allow VCs to better understand key challenges and issues that portfolio companies are facing. The full distribution of responses to the indirect questions is depicted graphically in the first four rows of Figure 3.  \n\nPanel D of Table II summarizes the responses to our specific questions. Again, the precise wording of the questions is shown in Section VI of the Internet Appendix. In this case, 83% agreed that the introduction of a direct fight would increase the frequency with which they visit a portfolio company and 89% agreed that a direct fight would increase fexibility to visit a portfolio company when most useful. Interestingly, there was the least agreement (72%) that a direct fight would improve communications with the company. This is likely due to recent advances in communication technology. The remaining questions yielded agreement ranging from 75-81%, as survey participants agreed that the introduction of direct fights would help them establish better relationships with management teams, better understand the state of companies, and generally add more value. In all cases, the mean response was again significantly non-neutral at the $1\\%$ level. The full distribution of responses to the indirect questions is depicted graphically in the last six rows of Figure 3.  \n\nFinally, in unreported tests, we also explored whether the sensitivity to travel time differs across different types of participants. Because the survey was anonymous, we can only partition the sample based on answers to the preliminary questions. We find greater agreement with all 10 statements for VC partners, those currently working at a VC frm, as well as those who manage a greater number of companies. However, in most cases, the differences are not statistically significant. Nonetheless, these results provide some comfort that our overall findings do not primarily refect the views of low level associates or those that have not worked in the industry in many years.  \n\nTo summarize, the survey results indicate that VCs are likely to spend more time at their portfolio companies following a reduction in travel time. This qualitative evidence supports our underlying assumption that VC involvement is responsive to the treatment.16  \n\n## IV. Results  \n\n### A. Main Results  \n\nNext, we estimate variants of Equation (1) to examine whether the introduction of new airline routes that reduce the travel time between lead VC firms and their portfolio companies affects portfolio companies’ innovation and success. The results are presented in Table IV. In Columns (1)-(3) of Panel A, the dependent variable is the number of patents (in logs). The regression in Column (1) includes VC-company pair and year fixed effects. In Column (2), we also control for company age and a set of indicators for the stage of VC financing. In Column (3), we further control for local shocks by including the two sets of MSA by year fixed effects. The coefficient on the treatment indicator is very stable across all specifications. It lies between 0.031 and 0.037, which implies that the number of patents increases by 3.1% to 3.7% after the treatment. In Columns (4)-(6) of Panel A, we re-estimate these specifications using citations per patent (in logs) as the dependent variable. The coeffcient on the treatment indicator varies between 0.058 and 0.074, corresponding to an increase in citations per patent of 5.8% to 7.4%. In Columns (1)-(3) of Panel B, the dependent variable is an indicator equal to one if the company goes public (IPO) during the year. We find that the introduction of new airline routes leads to an increase in the likelihood of going public by approximately $1.0\\%$ . Finally, in Columns (4)-(6) of Panel B, the dependent variable is an indicator equal to one if the company goes public or is acquired during the year (\"Success\"). As is shown, the success likelihood increases by 1.1% to 1.4% following the treatment. Overall, our findings indicate that a reduction in VC monitoring costs leads to significant increases in innovation and the likelihood of a successful exit.17  \n\n### $B$ .Dynamic Effects of the Treatment  \n\nIn Table V, we study the dynamic effects of the introduction of new airline routes. Specifically, we replace the treatment indicator in Equation (1) with a set of four indicator variables representing the years around the treatment. For example, the indicator “Treatment (-1)” equals one if the VC-company pair observation is recorded in the year preceding the treatment. The other indicator variables are defined analogously with respect to the year of the treatment (O), the first year after the treatment (1), and two or more years after the treatment (2+). The underlying specification is the conservative specification used in Columns (3) and (6) of both panels of Table IV, i.e. the specification that includes control variables, VC-company pair fixed effects, year fixed effects, as well as the two sets of MSA by year fixed effects (henceforth, the “baseline specification\"). We observe a very similar pattern for all four dependent variables. In particular, we always find that the coefficient of Treatment (-1), which measures the “effect”’ of the new airline routes before their introduction, is small and insignificant, suggesting that there are no pre-existing trends in the data.18 The effect is positive but small in the year of the treatment (year O). It is only one year after the treatment (year 1) that the effect becomes large and significant. Finally, the effect is persistent in the longer run (years 2+). In sum, the dynamic pattern suggests that it takes about 12 to 24 months until the reduction in travel time materializes into greater innovation and higher likelihood of a successful exit.  \n\n### $C$ Lead versus Non-Lead VCs  \n\nThe results thus far indicate that the introduction of new airline routes between VCs and their existing portfolio companies leads to increased innovation and a higher likelihood of going public or being acquired. Our interpretation is that reduced travel time increases VC involvement, which in turn improves portfolio company outcomes. Still, because we do not observe VC involvement, we cannot definitively show that VC monitoring increases following a reduction in travel time. To further ensure that our results are driven by increased VC monitoring following the treatment, we take advantage of the fact that, ex ante, certain VCs are expected to be more sensitive to changes in monitoring costs than others. In particular, VC investments are often syndicated with one VC taking the role of the lead investor. The lead investor typically is the one primarily in charge of monitoring, while other investors are more passive providers of capital. Indeed, Gorman and Sahlman (1989) find that a VC acting as lead investor spends 10 times the number of hours on a company than he or she would otherwise. Accordingly, we expect the treatment effect to be concentrated in routes that connect portfolio companies with their lead VC, as opposed to other syndicate members.  \n\nTo investigate this hypothesis, we re-estimate our baseline specification in the sample of VCcompany pairs involving a non-lead investor located in a different MSA than the lead investor. We now set the treatment indicator to one if a new airline route is introduced that reduces the travel time between a portfolio company and a non-lead investor. The results are shown in Panel A of Table VI. We find that, for all dependent variables, the estimated treatment effect is statistically insignificant. Moreover, the sample size in this analysis is comparable to that from the baseline analysis and the point estimates are close to zero, suggesting these are well-estimated zero effects. One potential concern with this analysis, however, is that reducing travel time to the MSA of a non-lead VC may have less of an impact, not because those VCs are less involved, but because they are located in different types of cities. For example, they may be located in cities with fewer resources for start-ups. A priori, there is no reason to expect this to be the case, particularly because a typical VC acts in both a lead and non-lead capacity on different deals. Nonetheless, we explore the possibility that non-lead treatments connect companies to different types of MSAs in Panel B. As can be seen, non-lead treatments and lead treatments connect companies to MSAs that are similar in terms of population, income, as well as geography. Thus, the results overall are consistent with the argument that VC involvement increases following the treatment—travel time reductions appear to matter primarily for active investors.19  \n\n### $D$ . Small versus Large Reductions in Travel Time  \n\nIf travel time indeed matters, we expect to find a stronger treatment effect for larger reductions in travel time. In our baseline analysis, any new airline route that reduces the travel time between a VC firm and its portfolio company was coded as a treatment, regardless of the magnitude of the travel time reduction. We now interact the treatment indicator with two dummy variables indicating whether the reduction in travel time is “large\" or “small?\" We consider a travel time reduction to be large if it is more than one hour. The results are reported in Table VII. For travel time reductions of less than one hour, the treatment effect is small and insignificant. In contrast, the treatment effect is strongest and highly significant for travel time reductions of more than one hour. We note, however, that the difference between the two coefficients is not statistically significant at conventional levels. Given the limited number of treatments we observe in the data, we may not have sufficient power to identify cross-sectional differences, even if they are present.  \n\n### $E$ Robustness  \n\n#### E.1. Hub Openings and Airline Mergers  \n\nAs explained in Section II.B, one potential concern that is not addressed by controlling for local shocks is the possibility that a VC-company pair-specific shock is driving both company outcomes and the introduction of a new airline route (e.g., through lobbying). Given the relatively small size of portfolio companies and VC firms, such alternative stories seem unlikely. Moreover, we have verified that our results are robust if we restrict our sample to portfolio companies and VC firms whose size is below the median; that is, companies and VCs that are even less able to successfully lobby for a new airline route. In addition, if a new airline route is introduced in response to a pair-specific shock, one may already observe an “effect” of the new airline route before it is even introduced. However, when we looked at the dynamics of the treatment effect, we found no evidence for such pre-existing trends.  \n\nAnother way to rule out this concern is by considering new airline routes that are introduced as part of a hub opening or a merger between airlines. Arguably, it is unlikely that a pair-specific shock could induce the opening of a new hub or the merger of two airlines. Thus, new airline routes of this kind are more likely to be exogenous. The data on hub openings and airline mergers are obtained from Giroud (2013). Hub and merger treatments account for about 15% of the treatments in our sample. In Panel A of Table VIlI, we replace the treatment indicator in our baseline specification with two dummy variables indicating hub/merger treatments (Hub or Merger\") and other treatments (\"Other\"), respectively. As can be seen, our results are robust when considering hub and merger treatments, which alleviates concerns that our results may be driven by unobservable pair-specific shocks.20  \n\n#### E.2. Eventually Treated Pairs  \n\nAs discussed in Section II.C, in order to be treated, a VC-company pair needs to be suffciently far apart so that air travel is the optimal means of transportation between the two. Thus, by construction, treated pairs are farther away than control pairs. This difference raises the concern of whether our control group is an appropriate one. While the inclusion of VC-company pair fixed effects accounts for any time-invariant differences between pairs (such as differences in distance), a remaining concern is that long-distance VC-company pairs may be on a different trend. To mitigate this concern, we re-estimate our baseline specification using only observations of the eventually treated pairs—essentially, due to the staggered introduction of the new airline routes, Equation (1) can be estimated using only this subsample (for a similar robustness check, see Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003). In this case, the control group consists exclusively of pairs that are subsequently treated, thus alleviating concerns about the comparability of the control group. In our context, a caveat of this test is that the number of observations drops to 7,978 pair-year observations, which makes it infeasible to control for MSA by year fixed effects. The results without these fixed effects are reported in Panel B of Table VII1. They are similar to our baseline estimates.  \n\n#### E.3. Miscellaneous Robustness Checks  \n\nThis section presents additional robustness checks. For brevity's sake, the results are tabulated in the Internet Appendix.  \n\nDistance-matched control group. To further mitigate the concern that control and treated pairs may be on different trends, we re-estimate our baseline specification after restricting the control group to those control pairs whose average distance matches the average distance in the treatment group. More precisely, we exclude short-distance control pairs (in increasing distance) until the average distance is the same in both groups. The results are presented in Panel A of Internet Appendix Table IA.III. As is shown, our results are robust to using this “distance-matched” control group.  \n\nHeterogenous time trends. Another way to address the possibility that control and treated pairs may be on diferent trends is to explicitly control for such heterogeneous time trends. This can be done by interacting the cross-sectional characteristics of interest (e.g., distance) with the full set of year fixed effects (see Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003). Specifically, we interact all characteristics from Table II with year fixed effects and re-estimate our baseline specification with these additional controls. The results are reported in Panel B of Internet Appendix Table IA.III. The estimated treatment effects are very similar to before.  \n\nAlternative dependent variables. In Panel C of Internet Appendix Table IA.IIl, we explore whether our results are robust to alternative definitions of our main dependent variables. As discussed in Section I.B.2, in our baseline analysis we only consider citations during a three-year window following a patent grant, so that all patents in our sample have the same amount of time to garner citations. Hall et al. (2001) propose an alternative adjustment method that uses the estimated shape of the citation-lag distribution. In Column (1), we re-estimate our baseline specification, adjusting for truncation in this manner. The coefficient on the treatment indicator is similar to before. Another common practice in the literature is the use of citation-weighted patent counts (Trajtenberg, 1990). Column (2) shows that using this weighting leads to qualitatively similar results. Citation intensity also varies considerably across time and industries. In Column (3), we normalize each patent's (three-year) citation count by the mean citation count for patents granted in the same year and in the same technology class. This again yields similar results.  \n\nIndustry-specific local shocks. Next, we refine our baseline specification by allowing local shocks to be industry specific, that is, instead of including MSA by year fixed effects in Equation (1), we now include MSA by industry by year fixed effects (for both the MSAs of the portfolio company and the VC). We partition industries according to the six major industry groups of VentureXpert. The results are presented in Panel D of Internet Appendix Table IA.II1. As is shown, the estimates are very similar to our baseline coefficients in Table IV. However, the significance of the treatment effect is lower for all dependent variables (the treatment effect is even marginally insignificant for the IPO and Success indicators). This is not surprising given that the additional layer of industry fixed effects reduces the power of our tests.  \n\nTwo-way clustering. In Panel E of Internet Appendix Table IA.III, we re-estimate our baseline specification, clustering standard errors at both the portfolio company level and the VC firm level. As is shown, this changes our standard errors little and all results continue to be statistically significant.  \n\nAccess to non- VC resources. Finally, one potential concern is that a portfolio company might improve after the treatment not because of increased VC involvement, but because the portfolio company gains access to other resources at the VC's location (e.g., universities, technology centers, trade shows). This concern is mitigated by the inclusion of MSA by year fixed effects, since all companies at the same location would benefit from more direct access to these resources (regardless of the location of their VC). Nevertheless, to further rule out this alternative explanation, we examine whether the treatment leads to an increase in citations made to patents of non-VC individuals/organizations at the VC's location. More precisely, for each patent a portfolio company is granted, we calculate the percentage of citations that the patent makes to firms or inventors located in the MSA of the portfolio company's VC.21 We then examine whether this percentage increases following a reduction in travel time. The results are reported in Internet Appendix Table IA.IV. As can be seen, the estimated coefficients are statistically indistinguishable from zero and the magnitude of the point estimates is small as well. Thus, there is no evidence that the innovative activity of the treated companies is infuenced by increased access to non-VC resources at the VC's location.  \n\n#### F.1. Cross-Sectional Heterogeneity  \n\nIn Internet Appendix Table IA.V, we explore whether the treatment effect differs based on crosssectional characteristics (e.g., early versus late stage companies). To conduct this analysis, we interact the treatment indicator with the characteristics of interest. This analysis is subject to two caveats. First, while the treatment is arguably exogenous, the variables interacted with the treatment may not bethat is, they may correlate with unobservable characteristics that affect the extent to which VC-company pairs react to the treatment. Second, given the limited number of treatments we observe in the data, we may not have sufficient power to identify heterogeneous effects, even if they are present. Despite these caveats, we do find suggestive results that go in the direction one might expect.  \n\nIn Panel A, we interact the treatment variable with an “Early Stage\" indicator equal to one if the company is classified as “Seed\" or “Early Stage\" in the year under observation. We find evidence that the treatment effect is larger for early stage companies, suggesting that VC involvement may matter more early on. For patents (citations), the coefficient on the interaction term is positive and statistically significant. In terms of magnitudes, the effect of a reduction in travel time on patents is estimated to be about 4.5 (3.4) times larger for early stage companies. For IPOs (success), the point estimates suggest that the effect is about 2.6 (1.5) times larger; however, in this case, the difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels, potentially due to lack of power.  \n\nPanel B interacts the treatment variable with an “Other VC Close\" indicator equal to one if a non-lead VC (that is part of the investment syndicate) is located in the same MSA as the portfolio company. The point estimates of the interaction term coefficient are negative, suggesting that the treatment effect is smaller when a non-lead VC is located nearby. However, the difference in the effect is not statistically significant. This may reflect the fact that non-lead VCs are less actively involved in monitoring as discussed in Section IV.C. Finally, Panel C interacts the treatment variable with a “Syndicated\" indicator equal to one if more than one VC invested in the company.  \n\nThe point estimates are again negative but not statistically significant.  \n\n#### F.2. Regional Analysis  \n\nLastly, a natural extension of our analysis is to study whether proximity fosters VC fows between regions—to the extent that travel time affects performance outcomes within existing VC-company relationships, it likely also affects VCs’ investment decisions. This analysis is provided in Section V of the Internet Appendix. In a nutshell, we find that the introduction of a new airline route between two MSAs leads to a 4.6% increase in total VC investments as well as a 2.5% increase in the likelihood of VC activity between the two MSAs. These results indicate that better airline connections do indeed foster VC fows between regions.  \n\n## V. Conclusion  \n\nDo VCs contribute to the innovation and success of their portfolio companies, or do they simply identify and invest in companies that are already poised to innovate and succeed even absent their involvement? Our results suggest that VC involvement does matter. Specifically, we exploit exogenous reductions in monitoring costs stemming from the introduction of new airline routes that reduce the travel time between VCs and their existing portfolio companies, thereby holding company selection fixed. If differences in outcomes for portfolio companies are driven only by selection, reductions in monitoring costs subsequent to selection should have no effect. On the other hand, if VC activities do matter, reductions in monitoring costs should translate into better portfolio company performance by allowing VCs to engage in more of these activities.  \n\nWe find that reductions in travel time lead to an increase in the number of patents and number of citations per patent of the portfolio company, as well as an increase in the likelihood of an IPO or acquisition. These results are robust to controlling for local shocks that could potentially drive the introduction of the new airline routes. We also document that the effect is concentrated in routes that connect lead VCs (as opposed to other investors) with portfolio companies. Overall, our results indicate that VCs′ on-site involvement with their portfolio companies is an important determinant of innovation and success.  \n\nWe confirm the importance of this channel by conducting a large-scale survey of VC investors. We find that almost 90% of the respondents agreed that they would visit a portfolio company more frequently if an indirect fight were replaced by a direct fight. Moreover, survey participants also agreed that the introduction of a direct fight would help them establish better relationships with management teams, better understand the state of their companies, and generally add more value.  \n\n#  \n\nNEF EIEINUESO   \nAghion, Philippe, John Van Reenen, and Luigi Zingales, 2013, Innovation and institutional ownership, American Economic Review, 103, 277-304.   \nAnderson, James C., 1978, The validity of haire's shopping list projective technique, Journal of Marketing Research, 15, 644-649.   \nBerglof, Erik, 1994, A control theory of venture capital finance, Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 10, 247-267.   \nBertrand, Marianne, and Sendhil Mullainathan, 2003, Enjoying the quiet life?

The height of the bars indicates the percentage of companies funded by a lead VC in the same state.  \n\n![](images/ae0519ee816595f6714f13a122614cf2dd7c09c592c42729bec4f6c749c3e1e4.jpg)  \n\n![](images/b3d61f7a97ba6260482ba077356ac20500036508e658a48a36c7513dbf99a6e1.jpg)  \nFigure2 CDF of Distance Distribution This figure plots the cumulative density function (CDF) of the VC-company distance distribution.  \n\n![](images/3aa5d07716deff6f04cb4d6319e79b7578bca233e085c3d92510a9e7d9cfcb10.jpg)  \na.1n.8t.H  \n\n### Table I Sample Composition  \n\nThis table shows the composition of portfolio companies and VC firms in the sample. Portfolio companies are categorized as “Never Treated\" if they never experienced a reduction in travel time to their lead VC investor, and “Ever Treated\" otherwise. Similarly, VC frms are categorized as “Never Treated” if they never experienced a reduction in travel time to any of the companies in their portfolio (for which they were a lead investor), and “Ever Treated\" otherwise. Panel A shows the company region distribution. Panel B shows the company industry distribution. Panel C shows the VC region distribution.  \n\nPanel A: Company Region   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Never Treated</td><td colspan=\"2\">Ever Treated</td><td colspan=\"2\">A1l</td></tr><tr><td>Freq</td><td>Percent</td><td>Freq</td><td>Percent</td><td>Freq</td><td>Percent</td></tr><tr><td>Alaska/Hawaii</td><td>22</td><td>0.10</td><td>1</td><td>0.09</td><td>23</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>Great Lakes</td><td>1054</td><td>4.81</td><td>51</td><td>4.66</td><td>1105</td><td>4.81</td></tr><tr><td>Great Plains</td><td>738</td><td>3.37</td><td>44</td><td>4.02</td><td>782</td><td>3.40</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-Atlantic</td><td>1178</td><td>5.38</td><td>59</td><td>5.39</td><td>1237</td><td>5.38</td></tr><tr><td>N.

Observations are shown at the level at which variables vary and are broken down by those that are “Never Treated\" and those that are “Ever Treated,\" as defined in Table I. Great circle distance is the distance (in miles) between the VC's ZIP code and the company's ZIP code. Travel time is the amount of time (in minutes) it takes to travel from the VC's ZIP code to the company's ZIP code (round trip) based on the optimal itinerary and means of transportation. Change in travel time is the reduction in travel time that occurs due to the treatment. Patents is the raw patent count, citations per patent is the number of citations garnered per patent in the three years after being granted, investment is the funding the portfolio company receives from all VCs in a given year. VC firm experience is measured as the number of years since firm founding, the number of companies invested in to date, and the number of investments that have gone public to date.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"3\">Never Treated</td><td colspan=\"3\">Ever Treated</td></tr><tr><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std Dev</td><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std Dev</td></tr><tr><td>Company-VC Pair Level:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Great Circle Distance (Miles)</td><td>30373</td><td>735.89</td><td>931.84</td><td>1131</td><td>1236.13</td><td>845.38</td></tr><tr><td>Travel Time (Minutes)</td><td>30373</td><td>470.22</td><td>551.17</td><td>1131</td><td>719.82</td><td>252.37</td></tr><tr><td>Change in Travel Time (Minutes)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1131</td><td>126.18</td><td>87.57</td></tr><tr><td>Company-Year Level:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Patents</td><td>111959</td><td>0.44</td><td>6.37</td><td>9293</td><td>0.28</td><td>1.28</td></tr><tr><td>Citations Per Patent</td><td>111959</td><td>1.43</td><td>7.89</td><td>9293</td><td>1.03</td><td>6.09</td></tr><tr><td>Investment (Millions)</td><td>111959</td><td>3.28</td><td>10.86</td><td>9293</td><td>1.70</td><td>7.14</td></tr><tr><td>VC-Year Level:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Experience (Years)</td><td>17404</td><td>11.00</td><td>13.43</td><td>8554</td><td>14.98</td><td>12.16</td></tr><tr><td>Experience (Companies)</td><td>17404</td><td>16.18</td><td>27.28</td><td>8554</td><td>53.85</td><td>74.36</td></tr><tr><td>Experience (IPOs)</td><td>17404</td><td>1.94</td><td>5.21</td><td>8554</td><td>8.26</td><td>15.21</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n### Table III Survey Evidence  \n\nThis table shows the results of a survey of VC investors. Panel A shows the distribution of respondents across countries and U.S. states. Panel B summarizes the responses to the preliminary questions. Panels C and D summarize the responses to the key questions shown in Section VI of the Internet Appendix. The questions in Panel C regard general VC behavior, whereas the questions in Panel D regard the behavior of the respondents. On all questions, a standard 6-point likert scale is used, where potential responses range from Strongly Disagree $=1$ ) to Strongly Agree ( $=6$ ). The $\\%$ Agree column represents the percent of respondents that somewhat agreed, agreed, or strongly agreed with the statement. A $t$ test is done to determine if the mean response is statistically different from the neutral mid-point of 3.5. $^*$ ,\\*\\*, and $^{***}$ denote statistical significance at the $10\\%$ ， $5\\%$ ,

Colombo?, and Anita Quas'  \n\n# Abstract  \n\nWe use the theory of organizational ecology to study how governmental venture capital (GVC) affects the investment behavior of private venture capital (PVC). Because of its objectives and dominant competencies, GVC is a unique organizational species that occupies a different niche than PVC. GVC is conceived to establish mutualistic relations with PVC. Accordingly, the greater the presence of GVC in a venture capital (VC) ecosystem, the more PVC investors should be attracted toward GVC's niche. We consider several relevant niche dimensions at the company (age and size), industry (biotechnology), and regional (competitiveness) levels. Our analysis of I,239 PVC investments in Europe confirms most of our predictions.  \n\n# Keywords  \n\ninvestment behavior, venture capital, investment, organizational ecology, government policy/ regulation  \n\nGovernmental venture capital (GVC) is a government-owned investment vehicle that is structured like a venture capital (VC) fund. GVC funds have been created in many countries, including the United States (Lerner, 1999), Australia (Cumming & Johan, 2009), Canada (Cumming & Macintosh, 2006), and Europe (Bertoni, Colombo, & Quas, 2015). They have a mandate to close the gap left by private VC (PVC) in funding innovative start-ups, to promote the creation of new jobs and to foster local development (Colombo, Cumming, & Vismara, 2016). The aim of this paper is to assess how PVC investors' investment behavior is altered by the presence of GVC.  \n\nThe literature has addressed this important issue by studying whether GVC stimulates (crowds in) or displaces (crowds out) PVC investments. Most studies investigate whether the aggregate volume of VC investments from private sources increases or decreases when GVC is introduced in a given market, obtaining mixed results (Armour & Cumming, 2006; Brander, Du, & Hellmann, 2015; Cumming & Macintosh, 2006; del-Palacio, Zhang, & Sole, 2012; Jeng & Wells, 2000; Leleux & Surlemont, 2003). Only a few studies use firm-level data, showing that companies that receive GVC are more likely both to receive PVC (Guerini & Quas, 2016) and to receive a larger amount of VC funding (Brander et al., 2015).  \n\nGVC may alter the VC ecosystem not only by stimulating PVC investments but also by inducing PVC investors to target different companies (i.e., to invest in companies they would neglect in the absence of GVC). The literature has not systematically analyzed this phenomenon, with the exception of Kovner and Lerner (2015), who show that the presence of community development VC-a type of VC that has objectives similar to those of GVC-increases PVC investors? propensity to invest in underserved regions.  \n\nIn this work, we use the lens of organizational ecology to investigate how GVC's density in a VC ecosystem influences the characteristics of the companies that are the target of PVC investments. Organizational ecology predicts that different organizational species in the same ecosystem may interact and that this interaction may determine changes to how those species \"earn a living,’ that is, to their niches. These theoretical lenses are particularly suitable for modeling the relationship between GVC and PVC. GVC and PVC differ markedly in terms of their objectives and dominant competencies and, therefore, can be treated as distinct organizational species (McKelvey, 1982). The theory of organizational ecology predicts that the result of the interaction between two species depends upon the extent to which their niches differ and upon the type of relationship (competitive vs. mutualistic) that the two species have. Building on Echols and Tsai (2005), we define the niches of GVC and PVC based on the specific combination of the investment opportunities pursued by the two species. Because of its political mandate, GVC invests in companies that, compared to PVC's typical targets, tend to be smaller, in earlier stages of development, in industries with longer time to market and more severe information asymmetries, and in more economically disadvantaged regions (Bertoni & Tykvova, 2015; Kovner & Lerner, 2015; Mason & Harrison, 2003). Moreover, the goal of creating a GVC fund is to promote PVC development in areas of the economy in which its limited presence generates a funding gap. Accordingly, PVC and GVC have niches that overlap (as testified by the existence of syndicated investments between the two investment types) but only partially, because some investment targets that are attractive to GvC are not a natural investment target for PVC. To attract PVC investments to these companies, GVC must establish with PVC what is known in organizational ecology as a mutualistic relationship, that is, a relationship in which the presence of one species is beneficial for the other species. We predict that if a mutualistic relationship exists between GVC and PVC, a higher density of GVC in a given VC ecosystem will make PVC investors more likely to invest in companies that are the typical target of GVC and that they would neglect in the absence of GVC.  \n\nIn the empirical section of the paper, we observe VC ecosystems that differ in GVC's density and study the extent to which the PVC niche is affected by the presence of GVC. We exploit the fact that national borders represent for VC investors what geographic barriers represent for ecological populations. Institutional characteristics shape national VC markets (Bruton, Fried, & Manigart, 2005; Jeng & Wells, 2000), and VC investors without previous experience in cross-border deals (Meuleman & Wright, 2011) and specific human resources (Manigart et al., 2007) are unlikely to invest internationally. We thus consider different European countries as different ecosystems.' Europe is an interesting research setting because GVC plays a much more important role in Europe than in the United States (Bertoni et al., 2015), and the extent of its presence is heterogeneous both across European countries and, for each country, over time.  \n\nOur econometric analysis takes advantage of the VICO database, which was created by the VICO research project, promoted by the  European Commission's 7th Framework Programme (Bertoni & Marti, 2011). We use information on 1,239 first investments made between 1994 and 2004 by 676 PVC investors in 560 high-tech companies that were less than 10 years old at the time of the investment and located in seven European countries. The VICO database represents an ideal choice for our analysis because it offers an unbiased representation of the niches of PVC (and GVC), allowing us to compare seven VC ecosystems over a 10- yearperiod.  \n\n## Theory and Hypotheses  \n\n### The Organizational Ecology View of Governmental and Private Venture Capital  \n\nIn the organizational ecology literature, populations are collections of organizations that share the same form in a particular location and time period (Hannan & Freeman, 1977). Manigart (1994) was the first to consider VC as a population of organizations in the sense meant by Hannan and Freeman (1977) and the first to study how the density of VC firms affects the founding rates of new VC firms. Echols and Tsai (2005) also use these theoretical lenses and focus on the product and process niches of VC investors, defined according to the type of investment opportunities that are pursued.  \n\nA population of organizations can be partitioned into different organizational species, which are subsets of the overall population characterized by different objectives and dominant competencies (McKelvey, 1982). Because of these differences, organizational species may occupy different niches (Hannan & Freeman, 1977; McPherson, 1983). The first step of our theoretical reasoning is therefore to argue that GVC and PVC represent different organizational species and, thus, tend to occupy different niches. PVC investors′ primary objective is to maximize the economic returns from their investments. Accordingly, their niche favors investments in companies that have high risk-adjusted expected return, are less exposed to information asymmetries, and enjoy advantageous environmental conditions. GVC funds have instead been created to alleviate capital market failures arising from limited supply of VC. Their aim is to provide funding for companies that are subject to more severe information asymmetries and higher investment risk (Brander et al., 2015; Colombo et al., 2016) and, thus, despite their potential, experience serious difficulties in obtaining the capital they need. Moreover, GVC is often motivated by broader political and social objectives, such as the creation of new jobs and the development of peripheral and economically lagging regions that lack an adequate local supply of VC (Lerner, 1999, 2002).  \n\nThe dominant competencies of GVC also differ from those of PVC. Because of its political objectives and inclination to invest in riskier and informationally more opaque companies located in peripheral areas, GVC finds it difficult to attract and retain talented investment managers (Jaaskelainen, Maula, & Murray, 2007). Hence, GVC's ability to provide portfolio companies with adequate coaching is more limited than that of PVC (Luukkonen, Deschryvere, & Bertoni, 2013). Conversely, because of its close relationship with public bodies, GVC is ideally placed to help portfolio companies obtain additional public support (e.g., Colombo, D'Adda, & Pirelli, 2016).2  \n\nThe second step of our theoretical reasoning focuses on the interaction between GVC and PVC. When different species coexist in the same ecosystem, their mutual interaction will result in a shift in their niches (Hannan & Freeman, 1977; McPherson, 1983). There are two types of interactions between species: mutualistic and competitive. In a mutualistic relationship, two species benefit from each other's presence, and their niches tend to converge, maximizing interaction (Hannan & Carroll, 1992). In a competitive relationship, the opposite happens: two species compete for the same resources and their niches tend to diverge, minimizing interaction (McPherson & Ranger-Moore, 1991). The organizational ecology theory suggests that the intensity of mutualistic or competitive interaction between species depends on those species′ density in the ecosystem, that is, “the number of organizations it contains\" (Hannan & Carroll, 1992, p. 5; see also Carroll & Hannan, 2000; Dobrev, Kim, & Hannan, 2001; and Manigart, 1994, who applied this concept in the context of VC). The higher the density of a species in an ecosystem, the more other species will shift toward (mutualism) or away from (competition) its niche.  \n\nWe have mentioned that GVC has the political mandate of flling the funding gap left by PVC, nurturing entrepreneurship and contributing to economic growth. To accomplish this mandate, GVC not only must insist on a niche that represents investments neglected by PVC but also must attract PVC to those investments. Therefore, GVC must create a mutualistic relationship with PVC, generating a crowding-in effect. Several factors underpin the mutualistic nature of the relationship between PVC and GVC. The first factor is risk sharing in syndication. PVC investors may syndicate with GVC to enter new segments of the market while keeping the investment risk low (Jaaskelainen, 2012). The denser the GVC in an ecosystem, the more PVC can reap the benefits of syndication and, therefore, shift its niche toward GVCs. Second, organization ecology suggests that higher density leads to the greater legitimacy of an organizational species (Carroll & Hannan, 1989), implying that its actions are perceived as socially acceptable, appropriate, and even desirable (e.g., Suchman, 1995). Hence, an increase in GVC's density in a VC ecosystem likely leads to a greater propensity by PVC to invest like a GVC (i.e., moving toward its niche) because the latter is perceived as more legitimate. Third, and relatedly, the increased legitimacy that is associated with the increased density of GVC in a VC ecosystem will also intensify the strength of the signal GVC conveys when investing in a particular market niche. These signals decrease information asymmetries and, therefore, reduce screening costs for PVC (Guerini & Quas, 2016; Marti & Quas, 2017), attracting it to GVC's niche.  \n\nOne important element of our identification strategy is that GVC's density will only affect PVC in the same VC ecosystem. Therefore, if we observe VC ecosystems with different GVC's densities, we can compare the niche of PVC across them. To this end, we will assume that countries represent distinct ecosystems for VC. This approach is particularly relevant in Europe during our observation period (1994-2004). In this period, the European VC market was fragmented because differences in administrative, regulatory and national tax policies created serious difficulties in cross-country fundraising and investments (European Commission, 2007). Additionally, GVC investors predominantly invest domestically (Bertoni et al., 2015); therefore, it is unlikely that they can influence the behavior of PVC investors abroad. To assess the influence of GVC on PVC investors’ investment behavior in the same VC ecosystem, we therefore exploit variations in the extent of the presence of GVC across European countries and over time.  \n\n### How GVC Affects the Niche of PVC  \n\nTo empirically test the extent to which GVC's density affects the PVC niche, we must identify some key dimensions along which the investments of the two organizational species are likely to differ. To do so, we build upon the extant literature (Dimov & Gedajlovic, 2010; Mayer, Schoors, & Yafeh, 2005) and identify four main dimensions that characterize investee companies: age, size, industry, and region.  \n\nInformation asymmetries make access to external financing very problematic for young and small high-tech companies (Hall & Lerner, 2010). These companies combine the need for substantial financial resources to fund investments with difficult access to debt capital because of their short track record and lack of collateral (Berger & Udell, 1990). Young and small high-tech companies therefore must rely on equity financing (Carpenter & Petersen, 2002) and would greatly benefit from obtaining VC. However, they often experience a severe funding gap because the information opaqueness of their innovation-based activities, the difficulties of rapidly scaling up their operations, and the associated investment risks deter PVC investments. Filling this funding gap is the objective of numerous governmental programs (Lerner, 2002). GVC's politically related objectives and dominant competencies make small, young high-tech companies a natural target of their investments. Hence, GVC is more focused than PVC on this type of company (Bertoni et al., 2015). If GVC is successful in creating a mutualistic relationship with PVC, the more GVC is present in a country in a given year, the more the niche of PVC should shift toward high-tech companies that are small and young. Hypotheses H1 and H2 follow.  \n\nHypothesis 1: PVC's tendency to invest in young high-tech companies will increase with GVC's density in the country.  \n\nHypothesis 2: PVC's tendency to invest in small high-tech companies will increase with GVC's density in the country.  \n\nBiotechnology plays a particularly important role for GVC. Innovation in biotechnology requires large financial investments and a very long time to break even (DiMasi & Grabowski, 2007). Moreover, tacit, specialized knowledge embedded in the human capital of scientists is critical for the success of these science-based companies (Junkunc, 2007), exacerbating issues of asymmetric information and moral hazard and making it difficult to obtain financing from private sources (Junkunc & Eckhardt, 2009). Because of this substantial funding gap, the role of government support is extremely important in determining the success of a country's biotechnology sector, which explains why this sector ranks high on policymakers’ agenda (Giesecke, 2000; Kang & Park, 2012). Moreover, biotech companies require significant nonfinancial (human, alliance) capital that is difficult to find and key to winning innovation races (Walker, Kogut, & Shan, 1997). It is especially important to attract PVC in this sector because of its ability to provide these key resources and build winners (Baum & Silverman, 2004). Accordingly, if GVC creates mutualistic relationships with PVC, we expect that a larger presence of GVC in a country shifts PVC's niche toward biotech companies, leading to Hypothesis H3.  \n\nHypothesis 3: PVC's tendency to invest in biotech companies will increase with GVC's density in the country.  \n\nGVC often has the explicit objective of fostering the economic development of less-favored regions. GVC is also ideally placed to help companies located in these regions access other policy schemes aimed at regional development (such as the structural funds of the European Union). This clearly differentiates GVC's niche from PVC's niche. Indeed, PVC is highly clustered in a few geographical areas that are generally the most economically and financially advanced (Chen, Gompers, Kovner, & Lerner, 2010; Powell, Koput, Bowie, & Smith-Doerr, 2002). Spatial clustering is strengthened by PVC investors′ tendency to invest locally, exploiting syndication networks and circumscribed information fows (Cumming & Dai, 2010).  \n\nDriven by the evidence linking the presence of PVC to local economic growth (Samila & Sorenson, 2011), GVC has been used— sometimes attracting criticism (Mason & Harrison, 2003)—as a means of fostering PVC development in regions that are underserved by PVC. Accordingly, we expect that the greater the presence of GVC within a given country, the more the establishment of mutualistic relationships between PVC and GVC will drive PVC's niche toward less-favored regions. Hypothesis H4 follows.  \n\nHypothesis 4: PVC's tendency to invest in less-developed regions willincrease with GVC's density in thecountry.  \n\n## Methods  \n\n### Research Setting  \n\nTo test our hypotheses, we use the database created by the VICO research project, supported by the 7th Framework Programme and promoted by the European Commission (Bertoni & Marti, 2011). The database collects information on VC investments in 759 European hightech companies over the period 1994-2004. These companies were owner-managed when founded, are located in seven European countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), operate in high-tech sectors,? and received their first VC round by their 10th year of existence.  \n\nVICO data on VC investments were collected via random extraction from commercial databases (i.e., Thomson One, VC-PRO, and Zephyr) and country-specific proprietary databases. The data were cross-checked with those available from public sources by a central data processing unit. Through accurate data cleaning, VICO overcomes commercial databases? well-known deficiencies in the coverage of VC outside the United States, including the overrepresentation of independent VC investments and the mischaracterization of GVC investments (Bertoni et al., 2015; Da Gbadji, Gailly, & Schwienbacher, 2015). Therefore, we are confident that VICO offers an unbiased representation of the niches of PVC (and GVC) and is especially suitable for our analysis.4  \n\nThe VICO database provides complete information on 1,239 first investments made by 676 PVC investors in 560 companies, which we use as our unit of analysis. Table 1 shows the distribution of the sample of PvC investments by sector and location of the company and investment year.  \n\n### Variables and Model  \n\nOur analysis includes four dependent variables that correspond to the four niche dimensions under consideration. The first dimension is the maturity of companies, measured by their age at the time of the investment. We generate a dummy variable Young that is equal to 1 if the investment is in a company less than 3 years old. The second niche dimension, company size, is captured by the dummy variable Micro, which—consistent with European Commission (2015)—is equal to 1 for target companies with fewer than 10 employees at the time of the investment. The third niche dimension is captured by the dummy variable Biotech, which identifies companies operating in biotechnology (Nace Rev 2. Codes 721X). The fourth niche dimension is the competitiveness of the region in which the investee company is located. This variable is measured using the Regional Competitiveness Index (RCI), an index computed at the regional (i.e., NUTS2) level by the European Commission (Annoni & Dijkstra, 2013) and based on several indicators that reflect the development, efficiency, and innovation of European regions measured between 2006 and 2011. We dichotomize the index and generate the variable LowRCI, which is equal to 1 for investments in regions with RCI lower than the median for the group of regions included in our sample (results are similar when taking the mean value as threshold). Because all our dependent variables are dummy variables, we resort to Probit specifications and we cluster standard errors on VC investors (results are unchanged without clustering of standard errors).  \n\nTable I.

This category includes electronic components, computers, telecommunication equipment, electronic, medical, and optical instruments.  \n\nOur key independent variable is GVC's density in each country and year in our sample. To measure it, we retrieved from_Thomson One all the first investments made by VC investors in high-tech companies.5 We then identified GVC investors. To correct for Thomson One's tendency to misclassify GVC investors, we extracted from Capital IQ the list of European VC investors whose parent company is owned by government entities and double-checked their governmental nature using information available on their websites. We used this information to complement the list of investors classified as \"Government Affliated Programs, “Development Programs,” or \"University Programs\"\\* in Thomson One (results are similar if we use the original classification by Thomson One). We computed, in each country and each year, the percentage of GvC investors $(\\%G V C)$ as the number of active GVC investors located in the focal country divided by the number of all active VC investors in the same country and lagged by 1 year. The coefficient of the variable is captured in the extent to which PVC's tendency to invest in categories of companies (i.e., young, small, biotech, and located in less-developed regions, respectively) is affected by GVC's density in the country.  \n\nTable 2.

The dummy variable First Round indicates whether the investment was the first VC investment ever received by the company, whereas the dummy variable Syndicated indicates the investments that are syndicated. Centrality is defined at the investor-year level and captures the extent to which the focal PvC investor is connected to other well-connected VC investors. We follow the approach of Hallen, Katila and Rosenberger (2014) to measuring the eigenvector centrality of the focal investor in the Thomson One database. We control for the development of national VC markets using the variable VConGDP, which gives the amount of early-stage VC investments as a percentage of GDP in each country and year (source: EVCA). Country and time dummy variables are also included in the analysis. Industry dummies are included in all models except the one in which Biotech is the dependent variable.  \n\nTable 2 illustrates the descriptive statistics and the correlation matrix for the variables used in the econometric analysis. With respect to the niche dimensions, $52.9\\%$ of our sample PVC investments are in young companies, $33.4\\%$ are in small companies, $20.2\\%$ are in biotech companies and $23.5\\%$ are in companies located in regions with low competitiveness.  \n\n## Results  \n\n### Main Results  \n\nTable 3 presents our main econometric results. The sign and the significance of the control variables are overall in line with our expectations. FirstRound is positively associated with Young and Micro, which means that first-round VC investments tend to be in younger and smaller companies compared to follow-on investments. Syndication is less common in Micro investments and more frequent in Biotech, consistent with the fact that syndication is used more when the capital invested is larger. VConGDP and Centrality are negatively associated with Micro, suggesting that more central VC investors and investors in more-developed VC markets are less likely to invest in smaller companies.  \n\nAs to our main independent variable, the coefficients of $\\%G V C$ are positive and significant in models for Young ( $p$ -value $<.01$ ), Micro $p$ -value $<.001$ )and LowRCI( $p$ -value $<.01$ ). The same holds true for the marginal effects (equal to 0.403 for Young, 0.432 for Micro and 0.318 for Low RCI, all with $p$ -value $<.01$ or better). When GVC is better represented in a country,  \n\nTable 3.

The magnitude of the effects of GVC's density in the focal country on the probability that PVC invests in younger, smaller companies located in less-competitive regions is also sizable. If we consider an “average” investment in our sample (i.e., all continuous control variables at their mean value and all categorical variables at their mode), when GvC investors are $6.3\\%$ of the total number of VC investors (15th percentile of the distribution of the $\\%G V C$ variable), the PVC's estimated probability of investing in young companies is $42.2\\%$ , its estimated probability of investing in micro companies is $17.5\\%$ and its estimated probability of investing in less-competitive regions is $12.3\\%$ When GVC investors instead represent $23.8\\%$ of the VC population (corresponding to the 85th percentile of the $\\%G V C$ variable), these probabilities rise to 50.5, 25.3, and $19.1\\%$ (i.e., an increase equal to 8.3 percentage points for young companies, 7.7 percentage points for micro companies and 6.7 percentage points for companies located in less-competitive regions). These results confirm Hypotheses H1, H2, and H4. In contrast, we do not find support for Hypothesis H $13\\colon\\%G V C$ does not exert any significant impact on PVC's tendency to invest in Biotech.  \n\n### Robustness Tests  \n\nOur results are robust to a series of modifications in the econometric models. First, we measure GVC's density using the number of investments (instead of the number of investors)  \n\nin each country and year (source: Thomson One database). Second, two of our dependent variables are significantly correlated: Young and Micro have a correlation of 0.29. Therefore, we use a bi-probit specification. Third, we change the measures that we use for some of our dimensions. For firm maturity, we substitute the variable Young with the variable Seed, which is 1 for investments in the seed stage. For regional development, we substitute LowRCI with the variable Outside VCHubs, which is equal to 1 for investments that are located outside of VC hubs, defined as the top 10 regions (NUTS2) in Europe per number of VC investments in the sample period (source: Thomson One, regions identified using reported addresses of VC investors). Fourth, we repeat our analysis dropping from our sample all investments by corporate and bank-affiliated VC and considering only independent VC investors as PVC species. The results obtained after each of the abovementioned modifications in the model are qualitatively similar to those illustrated in the previous section and are available from the authors uponrequest.  \n\n### Additional Results  \n\nThe European VC industry has changed during the period of our study, potentially affecting the relationships among VC types. Therefore, we study whether the association between GVC's density and PVC investors’ investment behavior is different before and after the Internet bubble of 2000, which is the most important event for the VC industry during our observation period. We repeat the analysis by interacting the variable $\\%G V C$ with two terms, one for each sub-period: pre-bubble and post-bubble. In Table 4, we show the results of this analysis. A Wald test (reported in the last row of the table) does not reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients of Pre-bubble $x\\%G V C$ and Post-bubble $x\\%G V C$ are equal at conventional significance levels along the Young, Micro, and Low RCI dimension. This result suggests that the relationship between the presence of GVC and the behavior of PVC investors that was illustrated above was at work in both sub-periods analyzed. In addition, in the pre-bubble period, GVC's density is positively and significantly ( $\\overset{\\vartriangle}p$ -value $<.05$ ) related to the likelihood that PVC investors select biotech companies as investment targets, as predicted by Hypothesis H3. This relation vanishes in the post-bubble period. One possible explanation is that the maturing of the biotech industry over time may have rendered the funding gap of which biotech companies suffer less severe in the most recent period (on this aspect, see, e.g., Higgins, Stephan, & Thursby, 2011).  \n\nNext, we shed some light on the mechanisms through which GVC's density influences the characteristics of PVC investment, considering the role of syndication between GVC and PVC investors. We split our sample in two subgroups: investments in which the PVC investor syndicated with a GVC investor (i.e., a GVC investor and a PVC investor invested in the same company in the same year) and investments in which no GVC was involved. We repeat the analysis for the two subsamples. In the subsample of PVC investments in which GVC was not involved, we substitute Syndicated with the variable SyndicatedWithPVC, which is equal to 1 if the investment is a syndicate with other PVC investors. Results are shown in Table 5. Panel A indicates that when GVC investors are involved in the investment, GVC's density has a positive impact on PVC's tendency to invest in younger and smaller companies (pvalue $<.001$ and .01, respectively). Panel B shows that along the Micro and LowRCI dimensions, the effect of $\\%G V C$ is also significant in deals in which GVC investors were not directly involved ( $p$ value $<.05$ and .01, respectively).  \n\nThus far, we have documented that the presence of GVC in a given country influences the investments behavior of PVC investors. It is interesting to show that, instead, the niche of GVC investors is not affected by their own density. For this purpose, we repeat the analysis on a sample of $284~\\mathrm{GVC}$ investments extracted from the VICO database. Table 6 shows the results of this analysis. The variable $\\%G V C$ is never significant, with only the partial exception of the Micro niche dimension, where it has a positive and weakly significant coefficient $p$ value $<.1$ ). We conclude that unlike PVC investments, GVC investment characteristics are not related to GVC's density.  \n\nTable4.Additional Evidence:Pre-andPost-lnternetBubble.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Dependent variable</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Young</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Micro</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Biotech</td><td rowspan=\"2\">IV LowRCI</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>FirstRound</td><td>0.989***</td><td>1.021***</td><td>0.082</td><td>0.166</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Syndicated</td><td>(0.089)</td><td>(0.114)</td><td>(0.101)</td><td>(0.109)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.062</td><td>-0.391**</td><td>0.355**</td><td>-0.048</td></tr><tr><td>(0.097)</td><td>(0.120)</td><td>(0.111)</td><td>(0.134)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Centrality</td><td>0.088</td><td>-7.066*</td><td>1.795</td><td>-2.447</td></tr><tr><td>(2.300)</td><td>(3.396)</td><td>(2.314)</td><td>(2.510)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">VConGDP</td><td>1.102</td><td>-7.155**</td><td>-3.062</td><td>-2.827</td></tr><tr><td>(1.689)</td><td>(2.519)</td><td>(1.838)</td><td>(2.057)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Pre-bubble x %GVC (α)</td><td>0.676</td><td>1.282*</td><td>1.165*</td><td>1.493*</td></tr><tr><td>(0.582)</td><td>(0.581)</td><td>(0.553)</td><td>(0.629)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Post-bubble x %GVC (β)</td><td>1.938**</td><td>1.744*</td><td>-0.441</td><td>1.788*</td></tr><tr><td>(0.697)</td><td>(0.692)</td><td>(0.565)</td><td>(0.828)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Constant</td><td>-0.299</td><td>0.275</td><td>-1.113***</td><td>-1.609***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.209)</td><td>(0.286)</td><td>(0.224)</td><td>(0.381)</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>1239</td><td>860</td><td>1239</td><td>1239</td></tr><tr><td>x²[DoF]</td><td>205.03 [18]***</td><td>186.27 [18]***</td><td>84.63 [13]**</td><td>5053.22 [18]**</td></tr><tr><td>Pseudo R2</td><td>.145</td><td>.212</td><td>.086</td><td>.353</td></tr><tr><td>Test α=β</td><td>1.775</td><td>0.255</td><td>3.780</td><td>0.077</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote.

We have argued that GVC is a different species from PVC because of GVC's political objectives and distinct dominant competencies. Hence, GVC occupies a different niche from PVC. Moreover, it is inherent in the political mandate of GVC to establish mutualistic relationships with PVC, attracting PVC investors to companies they would otherwise neglect because of informational opaqueness, excessive investment risk and peripheral location. The strength of this attraction depends on GVC's density in the ecosystem. To test our predictions, we considered a random sample of VC investments in seven European countries over the period 1994-2004. Our econometric results showed that in countries and years in which GVC was more strongly represented, PVC investors were more likely to invest in younger, smaller companies located in less-competitive regions. Because these companies are the typical target of GVC investors and are unattractive to PVC investors, we argue that these results confirm that GVC and PVC behave as organizational species in a mutualistic relationship. We also showed that syndication is one mechanism that GVC uses to attract PVC in its niche, but not the only one: even PVC investors that do not syndicate with GVC are more likely to invest in less-competitive regions and smaller companies when GVC's density is greater.  \n\nTable 5.

First, several recent studies have examined the impact of the GVC programs that have been set up by governments of several countries with the aim of closing the funding gap left by PVC. These studies have shown that in the effects of GVC financing on portfolio companies have been limited (Colombo et al., 2016). Scholars have also questioned whether GVC crowds out PVC instead of attracting it to companies that need equity financing. The evidence at an aggregate level of analysis is mixed. The findings in Armour and Cumming (2006) and Cumming and Macintosh (2006) are consistent with a crowding-out effect in North America and Europe. Conversely, Jeng and Wells (2000), Leleux and Surlemont (2003), del-Palacio et al. (2012), and Brander et al. (2015) show that GVC positively affects the development of the VC industry._Studies using firm-level data also offer a positive view. Brander et al. (2015) show that if GVC and PVC are both present in a company, the company receives a larger amount of VC investment than with GVC or PVC only. Guerini and Quas (2016) find that receiving GVC makes a firm three times more likely to receive PvC. Our study extends this latter stream of literature by investigating the changes triggered by the presence of GVC in a focal country in PVC investors' investment behavior located in the same country (on this topic, see also Kovner and Lerner, 2015). Our findings show that in countries in which the presence of GVC is stronger, PVC investors are more inclined to invest in firms that they tend to neglect in the absence of GVC (young, small, located in less-competitive regions).  \n\nSecond, our study contributes to a small stream of studies that have applied the theoretical lens of the organizational ecology perspective to analyze VC, notably Manigart (1994) and Echols and Tsai (2005). In this study, we combine their theoretical perspectives. We discuss the niches of GVC and PVC, defined by the different characteristics of the companies in which these two VC species tend to invest, and consider how GVC's density influences PVC investors' behavior, as reflected in their niche.  \n\nThis work has some limitations that open interesting avenues for future research. First, for the sake of brevity, we consider PVC a unique species. This species is quite heterogeneous, as it includes investors with different ownership and governance (Dimov & Gedajlovic, 2010), investment experience, and network embeddedness. Scholars may wish to investigate whether differences among PVC investors influence the strength of the mutualistic relationships they establish with GVC, or even give rise to competitive relationships. Similarly, not all GVC investors are alike (Jaaskelainen et al., 2007), and the design of GVC programs may infuence the relationships between GVC and PVC. Second, we document empirically the existence of mutualistic relationships between GVC and PVC and show that they are not exclusively driven by syndication between the two investor types. If more detailed information were available, researchers could more closely examine the mechanisms that drive changes in PVC investment behavior, such as the certification effects of GVC investments or incentives to invest in particular companies or regions. Third, our work is based on seven European countries. Extensions of this analysis to a larger number of countries, possibly including countries outside of Europe, would enable an examination of how institutional characteristics (e.g., investor protection, development of the stock market and the market for corporate control) moderate the intensity of the observed changes in PVC investments associated with GVC's density. Finally, data limitations force us to focus on four niche dimensions in this study. If additional information were available on the target companies selected by PVC investors, for instance, concerning the radicalness of the technology they were developing or their access to alternative financing channels such as business angels, crowdfunding or public subsidies, our analysis of the interaction between GVC and PVC could be made more comprehensive. Furthermore, future research may adopt a more detailed characterization of the niches' dimensions. For instance, while we consider companies operating in biotechnology as a single niche, it has been shown that biotechnology is a very heterogeneous sector, characterized by several fields, which could be considered as distinct sub-niches (Knockaert, Manigart, Cattoir, & Verstraete, 2015). The nonsignificance of our results along the biotech niche dimension could be driven by this limitation.  \n\nDespite these limitations, our study has interesting policy implications. Our results highlight a positive effect of GVC that has previously been overlooked. Taking into consideration the widely documented positive effects of PVC on portfolio companies (Da Rin, Hellmann, & Puri, 2013), the fact that the presence of GVC makes PVC more inclined to invest in companies it would otherwise neglect is good news for policymakers, and may offset the limited direct effects of GVC on portfolio companies. Accordingly, it would probably be wise to redefine the additionality of GVC programs in terms of their ability to redirect the “smart money” provided by PVC investors to companies that are most negatively affected by capital market imperfections.  \n\n# Acknowledgments  \n\nThe authors would like to thank the associate editor (Sophie Manigart), and two anonymus reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments.

The fact that in the observation period, VC markets in different European countries can be considered as distinct ecosystems, is indirectly documented by the introduction of the European venture capital passport in 2013 (European Parliament, 2013), which aimed to reduce the high barriers to cross-border intraEuropean VC investments (European Commission, 2007). This effort to foster cross-border VC investments is justified by the empirical evidence of a stronger positive effect of foreign VC investors on entrepreneurial ventures, for instance in terms of long-term growth (Devigne, Vanacker, Manigart, & Paeleman, 201l1), ability to stop escalation commitment (Devigne, Manigart, & Wright, 2016), and exit opportunities (Bertoni & Groh, 2014).   \n2. GVC is, in turn, a collection of different types of investors that potentially constitute subspecies, including funds owned by national governments, regional authorities, or public universities. PVC is also a collection of different subspecies, including independent VC, corporate VC, and bank-affliated VC (Bertoni et al.,   \n2015; Dimov & Gedajlovic, 2010; Mayer, Schoors, & Yafeh, 2005). However, we focus on aspects that all GVC and PVC investors have in common, making them two different species: the fact that PVC investments are driven by economic objectives (e.g, financial returns, technology sourcing, demand externalities), whereas GVC investments also have political objectives.   \n3. VICO considers the following sectors: nanotechnology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, computers, electronic components, telecommunication equipment, precision, optical and medical instruments, robotics, aerospace, software, telecommunications services, internet and multimedia services, web publishing, renewable energies, R&D, and engineering services. For further details on the VICO database, see Bertoni and Marti Pellon (20lI).   \n4. To verify this claim, we formally tested the randomness of the VICO database for a selection of VC investors. For each of the four investor types included in VICO-independent, corporate, bank, and governmental VC, we selected the investor with the highest number of investee companies according to VICO. The selected investors are 3i (independent VC in UK), Innovacom (corporate VC in France), Fortis (bank-affliated VC in Belgium), and BPI (formerly CDC, GVC in France), which together are responsible for I17 first investments in our sample. For those investors, we collected as much information as possible on their investment history using Thomson One, Zephyr, Crunchbase, and other Internet sources. Overall, we found 497 first investments by those investors between 1994 and 2004 in companies younger than I0 years at their first VC round, operating in high-tech sectors and located in the seven countries covered by ViCO. We believe this list comes very close to the population of investments made by the selected investors. For each investor, we compared the distribution of the investments in this population with that of the investments included in VICO along the following dimensions: company age at the time of the investment, sector of operation, and region of localization. We do not find any significant differences (the results of this analysis are available from the authors upon request).  \n\n5. High-tech companies include all those companies that belong to the following sectors of the VEIC classification used by Thomson Reuters: Information Technology, Biotechnology, and Pharmaceuticals. Results are similar if we also include companies in Medical Diagnostics, Medical Therapeutics and Medical/Health Products of theVElC classification.The data were downloaded in December20l6.  \n\nReferences   \nAnnoni, P., & Dijkstra, L.

GVC funds have been created in many countries, including the US (Lerner, 1999), Australia (Cumming & Johan, 2009), Canada (Cumming & Macintosh, 2006), and Europe (Bertoni, Colombo, & Quas, 2015). They have a mandate to close the gap left by private VC (PVC) in funding innovative start-ups, to promote the creation of new jobs and to foster local development (Colombo, Cumming, & Vismara, 2016). The aim of this paper is to assess how PVC investors? investment behavior is altered by the presence of GVC.  \n\nThe literature has addressed this important issue by studying whether GVC stimulates (crowds in) or displaces (crowds out) PVC investments. Most studies investigate whether the aggregate volume of VC investments from private sources increases or decreases when GVC is introduced in a given market, obtaining mixed results (Armour & Cumming, 2006; Brander, Du, & Hellmann, 2015; Cumming & Macintosh, 2006; del-Palacio, Zhang, & Sole, 2012; Jeng & Wells, 2000; Leleux & Surlemont, 2003). Only a few studies use firm-level data, showing that companies that receive GVC are more likely both to receive PVC (Guerini & Quas, 2016) and to receive a larger amount of VC funding (Brander et al., 2015).  \n\nGVC may alter the VC ecosystem not only by stimulating PVC investments but also by inducing PVC investors to target different companies (i.e., to invest in companies they would neglect in the absence of GVC). The literature has not systematically analyzed this phenomenon, with the exception of Kovner and Lerner (2015), who show that the presence of community development VC - a type of VC that has objectives similar to those of GVC - increases PVC investors? propensity to invest in underserved regions.  \n\nIn this work, we use the lens of organizational ecology to investigate how GVC's density in a VC ecosystem influences the characteristics of the companies that are the target of PVC investments. Organizational ecology predicts that different organizational species in the same ecosystem may interact and that this interaction may determine changes to how those species “earn a 2  \n\nliving,” i.e., to their niches. These theoretical lenses are particularly suitable for modeling the relationship between GVC and PVC. GVC and PVC differ markedly in terms of their objectives and dominant competencies and, therefore, can be treated as distinct organizational species (McKelvey, 1982). The theory of organizational ecology predicts that the result of the interaction between two species depends upon the extent to which their niches differ and upon the type of relationship (competitive vs. mutualistic) that the two species have. Building on Echols and Tsai (2005), we define the niches of GVC and PVC based on the specific combination of the investment opportunities pursued by the two species. Because of its political mandate, GVC invests in companies that, compared to PVC's typical targets, tend to be smaller, in earlier stages of development, in industries with longer time to market and more severe information asymmetries, and in more economically disadvantaged regions (Bertoni & Tykvova, 2015; Kovner & Lerner, 2015; Mason & Harrison, 2003). Moreover, the goal of creating a GVC fund is to promote PVC development in areas of the economy in which its limited presence generates a funding gap. Accordingly, PVC and GVC have niches that overlap (as testified by the existence of syndicated investments between the two investment types) but only partially, because some investment targets that are attractive to GVC are not a natural investment target for PVC. To attract PVC investments to these companies, GVC must establish with PVC what is known in organizational ecology as a mutualistic relationship, i.e., a relationship in which the presence of one species is beneficial for the other species. We predict that if a mutualistic relationship exists between GVC and PVC, a higher density of GVC in a given VC ecosystem will make PVC investors more likely to invest in companies that are the typical target of GVC and that they would neglect in the absence of GVC.  \n\nIn the empirical section of the paper, we observe VC ecosystems that differ in GVC's density and study the extent to which the PVC niche is affected by the presence of GVC. We exploit the fact that national borders represent for VC investors what geographic barriers represent for ecological populations. Institutional characteristics shape national VC markets (Bruton, Fried, & Manigart, 2005; Jeng & Wells, 2000), and VC investors without previous experience in cross-border deals 3  \n\n(Meuleman & Wright, 2011) and specific human resources (Manigart et al., 2007) are unlikely to invest internationally. We thus consider different European countries as diferent ecosystems.1 Europe is an interesting research setting because GVC plays a much more important role in Europe than in the US (Bertoni et al., 2015), and the extent of its presence is heterogeneous both across European countries and, for each country, over time.  \n\nOur econometric analysis takes advantage of the VICO database, which was created by the VICO research project, promoted by the European Commission's $7^{\\mathrm{th}}$ Framework Programme (Bertoni & Marti, 2011). We use information on 1,239 first investments made between 1994 and 2004 by 676 PVC investors in 560 high-tech companies that were less than 10 years old at the time of the investment and located in seven European countries. The VICO database represents an ideal choice for our analysis because it offers an unbiased representation of the niches of PVC (and GVC), allowing us to compare seven VC ecosystems over a 10-year period.  \n\n## THEORY AND HYPOTHESES  \n\n### The Organizational Ecology View of Governmental and Private Venture Capital  \n\nIn the organizational ecology literature, populations are collections of organizations that share the same form in a particular location and time period (Hannan & Freeman, 1977). Manigart (1994) was the first to consider VC as a population of organizations in the sense meant by Hannan and Freeman (1977) and the first to study how the density of VC firms affects the founding rates of new VC firms. Echols and Tsai (2005) also use these theoretical lenses and focus on the product and process niches of VC investors, defined according to the type of investment opportunities that are pursued.  \n\nA population of organizations can be partitioned into different organizational species, which are subsets of the overall population characterized by different objectives and dominant competencies (McKelvey, 1982). Because of these differences, organizational species may occupy different niches (Hannan & Freeman, 1977; McPherson, 1983). The first step of our theoretical reasoning is therefore to argue that GVC and PVC represent different organizational species and, thus, tend to occupy different niches. PVC investors’ primary objective is to maximize the economic returns from their investments. Accordingly, their niche favors investments in companies that have high risk-adjusted expected return, are less exposed to information asymmetries, and enjoy advantageous environmental conditions. GVC funds have instead been created to alleviate capital market failures arising from limited supply of VC. Their aim is to provide funding for companies that are subject to more severe information asymmetries and higher investment risk (Brander et al., 2015; Colombo, Cumming, & Vismara, 2016) and, thus, despite their potential, experience serious difficulties in obtaining the capital they need. Moreover, GVC is often motivated by broader political and social objectives, such as the creation of new jobs and the development of peripheral and economically lagging regions that lack an adequate local supply of VC (Lerner, 1999, 2002).  \n\nThe dominant competencies of GVC also differ from those of PVC. Because of its political objectives and inclination to invest in riskier and informationally more opaque companies located in peripheral areas, GVC finds it difficult to attract and retain talented investment managers (Jaaskelainen, Maula, & Murray, 2007). Hence, GVC's ability to provide portfolio companies with adequate coaching is more limited than that of PVC (Luukkonen, Deschryvere, & Bertoni, 2013). Conversely, because of its close relationship with public bodies, GVC is ideally placed to help portfolio companies obtain additional public support (e.g., Colombo, D'Adda, & Pirelli, 2016).2  \n\nThe second step of our theoretical reasoning focuses on the interaction between GVC and PVC. When different species coexist in the same ecosystem, their mutual interaction will result in a shift in their niches (Hannan & Freeman, 1977; McPherson, 1983). There are two types of interactions between species: mutualistic and competitive. In a mutualistic relationship, two species benefit from each other's presence, and their niches tend to converge, maximizing interaction (Hannan & Carroll, 1992). In a competitive relationship, the opposite happens: two species compete for the same resources and their niches tend to diverge, minimizing interaction (McPherson & Ranger-Moore, 1991). The organizational ecology theory suggests that the intensity of mutualistic or competitive interaction between species depends on those species? density in the ecosystem, i.e., “the number of organizations it contains\" (Hannan & Carroll, 1992, page 5; see also Carroll & Hannan, 2000; Dobrev, Kim, & Hannan, 2001 and Manigart, 1994, who applied this concept in the context of VC). The higher the density of a species in an ecosystem, the more other species will shift toward (mutualism) or away from (competition) its niche.  \n\nWe have mentioned that GVC has the political mandate of filling the funding gap left by PVC, nurturing entrepreneurship and contributing to economic growth. To accomplish this mandate, GVC not only must insist on a niche that represents investments neglected by PVC but also must attract PVC to those investments. Therefore, GVC must create a mutualistic relationship with PVC, generating a crowding-in effect. Several factors underpin the mutualistic nature of the relationship between PVC and GVC. The first factor is risk-sharing in syndication. PVC investors may syndicate with GVC to enter new segments of the market while keeping the investment risk low (Jaaskelainen, 2012). The denser the GVC in an ecosystem, the more PVC can reap the benefits of syndication and, therefore, shift its niche toward GVCs. Second, organization ecology suggests that higher density leads to the greater legitimacy of an organizational species (Carroll & Hannan, 1989), implying that its actions are perceived as socially acceptable, appropriate and even desirable (e.g., Suchman, 1995). Hence, an increase in GVC's density in a VC ecosystem likely leads to a greater propensity by PVC to invest like a GVC (i.e., moving toward its niche) because the latter is perceived as more legitimate. 6  \n\nThird, and relatedly, the increased legitimacy that is associated with the increased density of GVC in a VC ecosystem will also intensify the strength of the signal GVC conveys when investing in a particular market niche. These signals decrease information asymmetries and, therefore, reduce screening costs for PVC (Guerini & Quas, 2016; Marti & Quas, 2017), attracting it to GVC's niche.  \n\nOne important element of our identification strategy is that GVC's density will only affect PVC in the same VC ecosystem. Therefore, if we observe VC ecosystems with different GVC's densities, we can compare the niche of PVC across them. To this end, we will assume that countries represent distinct ecosystems for VC. This approach is particularly relevant in Europe during our observation period (1994-2004). In this period, the European VC market was fragmented because differences in administrative, regulatory and national tax policies created serious difficulties in crosscountry fundraising and investments (European Commission, 2007). Additionally, GVC investors predominantly invest domestically (Bertoni et al., 2015); therefore, it is unlikely that they can influence the behavior of PVC investors abroad. To assess the influence of GVC on PVC investors' investment behavior in the same VC ecosystem, we therefore exploit variations in the extent of the presence of GVC across European countries and over time.  \n\n### How GVC affects the niche of PVC  \n\nTo empirically test the extent to which GVC's density affects the PVC niche, we must identify some key dimensions along which the investments of the two organizational species are likely to differ. To do so, we build upon the extant literature (Dimov & Gedajlovic, 2010; Mayer et al., 2005) and identify four main dimensions that characterize investee companies: age, size, industry and region.  \n\nInformation asymmetries make access to external financing very problematic for young and small high-tech companies (Hall & Lerner, 2010). These companies combine the need for substantial financial resources to fund investments with difficult access to debt capital because of their short track record and lack of collateral (Berger & Udell, 1990). Young and small high-tech companies therefore must rely on equity financing (Carpenter & Petersen, 2002) and would greatly benefit from obtaining VC. However, they often experience a severe funding gap because the information opaqueness of their innovation-based activities, the difficulties of rapidly scaling up their operations, and the associated investment risks deter PVC investments. Filling this funding gap is the objective of numerous governmental programs (Lerner, 2002). GVC's politically related objectives and dominant competencies make small, young high-tech companies a natural target of their investments. Hence, GVC is more focused than PVC on this type of company (Bertoni et al., 2015). If GVC is successful in creating a mutualistic relationship with PVC, the more GVC is present in a country in a given year, the more the niche of PVC should shift toward high-tech companies that are small and young. Hypotheses H1 and H2 follow.  \n\nHypothesis 1: PVC's tendency to invest in young high-tech companies will increase with GVC's density in the country.   \nHypothesis 2: PVC's tendency to invest in small high-tech companies will increase with GVC's density in the country.  \n\nBiotechnology plays a particularly important role for GVC. Innovation in biotechnology requires large financial investments and a very long time to break even (DiMasi & Grabowski, 2007). Moreover, tacit, specialized knowledge embedded in the human capital of scientists is critical for the success of these science-based companies(Junkunc, 2007)(Junkunc, 2007)(Junkunc, 2007)(Junkunc, 2007)(Junkunc, 2007)(Junkunc, 2007)(Junkunc, 2007)(Junkunc, 2007)(Junkunc, 2007), exacerbating issues of asymmetric information and moral hazard and making it difficult to obtain financing from private sources (Junkunc & Eckhardt, 2009). Because of this substantial funding gap, the role of government support is extremely important in determining the success of a country's biotechnology sector, which explains why this sector ranks high on policymakers? agenda (Giesecke, 2000; Kang & Park, 2012). Moreover, biotech companies require significant non-financial (human, alliance) capital that is difficult to find and key to winning innovation races (Walker, Kogut, & Shan, 1997). It is especially important to attract PVC in this sector because of its ability to provide these key resources and build winners (Baum & Silverman, 2004). Accordingly, if GVC creates mutualistic relationships with PVC, we expect that a larger presence of GVC in a country shifts PVC's niche toward biotech companies, leading to hypothesis H3.  \n\nHypothesis 3: PVC's tendency to invest in biotech companies will increase with GVC's density in the country.  \n\nGVC often has the explicit objective of fostering the economic development of less-favored regions. GVC is also ideally placed to help companies located in these regions access other policy schemes aimed at regional development (such as the structural funds of the European Union). This clearly differentiates GVC's niche from PVC's niche. Indeed, PVC is highly clustered in a few geographical areas that are generally the most economically and financially advanced (Chen, Gompers, Kovner, & Lerner, 2010; Powell, Koput, Bowie, & Smith-Doerr, 2002). Spatial clustering is strengthened by PVC investors′ tendency to invest locally, exploiting syndication networks and circumscribed information flows (Cumming & Dai, 2010). Driven by the evidence linking the presence of PVC to local economic growth (Samila & Sorenson, 2011), GVC has been used - sometimes attracting criticism (Mason & Harrison, 2003) - as a means of fostering PVC development in regions that are underserved by PVC. Accordingly, we expect that the greater the presence of GVC within a given country, the more the establishment of mutualistic relationships between PVC and GVC will drive PVC's niche toward less-favored regions. Hypothesis H4 follows.  \n\nHypothesis 4: PVC's tendency to invest in less-developed regions will increase with GVC's density in the country.  \n\n## METHODS  \n\n### Research Setting  \n\nTo test our hypotheses, we use the database created by the VICO research project, supported by the $7^{\\mathrm{th}}$ Framework Programme and promoted by the European Commission (Bertoni & Marti, 2011). The database collects information on VC investments in 759 European high-tech companies over the 9  \n\nperiod 1994-2004. These companies were owner-managed when founded, are located in 7 European countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), operate in high-tech sectors? and received their first VC round by their $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$ year of existence.  \n\nVICO data on VC investments were collected via random extraction from commercial databases (i.e., Thomson One, VC-PRO, and Zephyr) and country-specific proprietary databases. The data were cross-checked with those available from public sources by a central data processing unit. Through accurate data cleaning, VICO overcomes commercial databases’ well-known deficiencies in the coverage of VC outside the US, including the overrepresentation of independent VC investments and the mischaracterization of GVC investments (Bertoni et al., 2015; Da Gbadji, Gailly, & Schwienbacher, 2015). Therefore, we are confident that VICO offers an unbiased representation of the niches of PVC (and GVC) and is especially suitable for our analysis.4  \n\nThe VICO database provides complete information on 1,239 first investments made by 676 PVC investors in 560 companies, which we use as our unit of analysis. Table 1 shows the distribution of the sample of PVC investments by sector and location of the company and investment year.  \n\n[Table 1 around here]  \n\n### Variables and Model  \n\n3 VICO considers the folowing sectors: nanotechnology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, computers, electronic components, telecommunication equipment, precision, optical and medical instruments, robotics, aerospace, software, telecommunications services, internet and multimedia services, web publishing, renewable energies, R&D and engineering services. For further details on the VICO database, see Bertoni and Marti Pellon (2011). 4 To verify this claim, we formally tested the randomness of the VICO database for a selection of VC investors. For each of the four investor types included in VICO - independent, corporate, bank and governmental VC, we selected the investor with the highest number of investee companies according to VICO. The selected investors are 3i (independent VC in UK), Innovacom (corporate VC in France), Fortis (bank-affiliated VC in Belgium) and BPI (formerly CDC, GVC in France), which together are responsible for 117 first investments in our sample. For those investors, we collected as much information as possible on their investment history using Thomson One, Zephyr, Crunchbase and other Internet sources. Overall, we found 497 first investments by those investors between 1994 and 2004 in companies younger than 10 years at their first VC round, operating in high-tech sectors and located in the 7 countries covered by VICO. We believe this list comes very close to the population of investments made by the selected investors. For each investor, we compared the distribution of the investments in this population with that of the investments included in VICO along the following dimensions: company age at the time of the investment, sector of operation, and region of localization. We do not find any significant differences (the results of this analysis are available from the authors upon request). 10  \n\nOur analysis includes four dependent variables that correspond to the four niche dimensions under consideration. The first dimension is the maturity of companies, measured by their age at the time of the investment. We generate a dummy variable Young that is equal to 1 if the investment is in a company less than 3 years old. The second niche dimension, company size, is captured by the dummy variable Micro, which - consistent with European Commission (2015) - is equal to 1 for target companies with fewer than 10 employees at the time of the investment. The third niche dimension is captured by the dummy variable Biotech, which identifies companies operating in biotechnology (Nace Rev 2. Codes 721X). The fourth niche dimension is the competitiveness of the region in which the investee company is located. This variable is measured using the Regional Competitiveness Index (RCI), an index computed at the regional (i.e., NUTS2) level by the European Commission (Annoni & Dijkstra, 2013) and based on several indicators that reflect the development, efficiency and innovation of European regions measured between 2006 and 2011. We dichotomize the index and generate the variable LowRCI, which is equal to 1 for investments in regions with RCI lower than the median for the group of regions included in our sample (results are similar when taking the mean value as threshold). Because all our dependent variables are dummy variables, we resort to Probit specifications and we cluster standard errors on VC investors (results are unchanged without clustering of standard errors).  \n\nOur key independent variable is GVC's density in each country and year in our sample. To measure it, we retrieved from Thomson One all the first investments made by VC investors in hightech companies. We then identified GVC investors. To correct for Thomson One's tendency to misclassify GVC investors, we extracted from Capital IQ the list of European VC investors whose parent company is owned by government entities and double-checked their governmental nature using information available on their websites. We used this information to complement the list of investors classified as “Government Affliated Programs,” “Development Programs” or \\*\"University Programs\" in Thomson One (results are similar if we use the original classification by Thomson One). We computed, in each country and each year, the percentage of GVC investors $(\\%G V C)$ as the number of active GVC investors located in the focal country divided by the number of all active VC investors in the same country and lagged by one year. The coefficient of the variable is captured in the extent to which PVC's tendency to invest in categories of companies (i.e., young, small, biotech and located in less-developed regions, respectively) is affected by GVC's density in the country.  \n\nSome additional variables are included in the analysis to control for the fact that the positioning of a PVC investment along each niche dimension may be influenced by investment-, investor- or country-specific characteristics. The dummy variable FirstRound indicates whether the investment was the first VC investment ever received by the company, whereas the dummy variable Syndicated indicates the investments that are syndicated. Centrality is defined at the investor-year level and captures the extent to which the focal PVC investor is connected to other well-connected VC investors. We follow Hallen et al.'s (2014) approach to measuring the eigenvector centrality of the focal investor in the Thomson One database. We control for the development of national VC markets using the variable VConGDP, which gives the amount of early-stage VC investments as a percentage of GDP in each country and year (source: EVCA). Country and time dummy variables are also included in the analysis. Industry dummies are included in all models except the one in which Biotech is the dependent variable.  \n\nTable 2 illustrates the descriptive statistics and the correlation matrix for the variables used in the econometric analysis. With respect to the niche dimensions, $52.9\\%$ of our sample PVC investments are in young companies, $33.4\\%$ are in small companies, $20.2\\%$ are in biotech companies and $23.5\\%$ are in companies located in regions with low competitiveness.  \n\n[Table 2 around here]  \n\n## RESULTS  \n\n### Main results  \n\nTable 3 presents our main econometric results. The sign and the significance of the control variables are overall in line with our expectations. FirstRound is positively associated with Young and Micro, which means that first-round VC investments tend to be in younger and smaller companies compared to follow-on investments. Syndication is less common in Micro investments and more frequent in Biotech, consistent with the fact that syndication is used more when the capital invested is larger. VConGDP and Centrality are negatively associated with Micro, suggesting that more central VC investors and investors in more-developed VC markets are less likely to invest in smaller companies.  \n\nAs to our main independent variable, the coefficients of $\\%G V C$ are positive and significant in models for Young (p-value<0.01), Micro (p-value ${<}0.001$ ) and LowRCI (p-value $<0.01$ ). The same holds true for the marginal effects (equal to 0.403 for Young, 0.432 for Micro and 0.318 for LowRCI, all with p-value $<0.01$ or better). When GVC is better represented in a country, PVC investors are more inclined to invest in younger companies, smaller companies, and companies located in lesscompetitive regions. The magnitude of the effects of GVC's density in the focal country on the probability that PVC invests in younger, smaller companies located in less-competitive regions is also sizable. If we consider an “average” investment in our sample (i.e., all continuous control variables at their mean value and all categorical variables at their mode), when GVC investors are $6.3\\%$ of the total number of VC investors ( $15^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of the distribution of the $\\%G V C$ variable), the PVC's estimated probability of investing in young companies is $42.2\\%$ , its estimated probability of investing in micro companies is $17.5\\%$ and its estimated probability of investing in lesscompetitive regions is $12.3\\%$ . When GVC investors instead represent $23.8\\%$ of the VC population (corresponding to the $85^{\\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of the $\\%G V C$ variable), these probabilities rise to $50.5\\%$ ， $25.3\\%$ and $19.1\\%$ (i.e., an increase equal to 8.3 percentage points for young companies, 7.7 percentage points for micro companies and 6.7 percentage points for companies located in less-competitive regions).  \n\nThese results confirm hypotheses H1, H2 and H4. In contrast, we do not find support for hypothesis H3: %GVC does not exert any significant impact on PVC's tendency to invest in Biotech.  \n\n### [Table 3 around here]  \n\n### Robustness tests  \n\nOur results are robust to a series of modifications in the econometric models. First, we measure GVC's density using the number of investments (instead of the number of investors) in each country and year (source: Thomson One database). Second, two of our dependent variables are significantly correlated: Young and Micro have a correlation of 0.29. Therefore, we use a bi-probit specification. Third, we change the measures that we use for some of our dimensions. For firm maturity, we substitute the variable Young with the variable Seed, which is 1 for investments in the seed stage. For regional development, we substitute LowRCI with the variable OutsideVCHubs, which is equal to 1 for investments that are located outside of VC hubs, defined as the top 10 regions (NUTS2) in Europe per number of VC investments in the sample period (source: Thomson One, regions identified using reported addresses of VC investors). Fourth, we repeat our analysis dropping from our sample all investments by corporate and bank-affiliated VC and considering only independent VC investors as PVC species. The results obtained after each of the abovementioned modifications in the model are qualitatively similar to those illustrated in the previous section and are available from the authors upon request.  \n\n### Additional results  \n\nThe European VC industry has changed during the period of our study, potentially affecting the relationships among VC types. Therefore, we study whether the association between GVC's density and PVC investors? investment behavior is different before and after the Internet bubble of 2000, which is the most important event for the VC industry during our observation period. We repeat the analysis by interacting the variable $\\%G V C$ with two terms, one for each sub-period: pre-bubble and post-bubble. In Table 4, we show the results of this analysis. A Wald test (reported in the last row of the table) does not reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients of Pre-bubble x %GVC and Postbubble x %GVC are equal at conventional significance levels along the Young, Micro and LowRCI dimension. This result suggests that the relationship between the presence of GVC and the behavior of PVC investors that was illustrated above was at work in both sub-periods analyzed. In addition, in the pre-bubble period, GVC's density is positively and significantly (p-value $<0.05$ )related to the likelihood that PVC investors select biotech companies as investment targets, as predicted by hypothesis H3. This relation vanishes in the post-bubble period. One possible explanation is that the maturing of the biotech industry over time may have rendered the funding gap of which biotech companies suffer less severe in the most recent period (on this aspect, see, e.g., Higgins, Stephan, & Thursby, 2011).  \n\n### [Table 4 around here]  \n\nNext, we shed some light on the mechanisms through which GVC's density influences the characteristics of PVC investment, considering the role of syndication between GVC and PVC investors. We split our sample in two sub-groups: investments in which the PVC investor syndicated with a GVC investor (i.e., a GVC investor and a PVC investor invested in the same company in the same year) and investments in which no GVC was involved. We repeat the analysis for the two subsamples. In the sub-sample of PVC investments in which GVC was not involved, we substitute Syndicated with the variable SyndicatedWithPVC, which is equal to 1 if the investment is a syndicate with other PVC investors. Results are shown in Table 5. Panel A indicates that when GVC investors are involved in the investment, GVC's density has a positive impact on PVC's tendency to invest in younger and smaller companies (p-value<0.o01 and 0.01, respectively). Panel B shows that along the Micro and LowRCI dimensions, the effect of $\\%G V C$ is also significant in deals in which GVC investors were not directly involved (p-value $<0.05$ and 0.01, respectively).  \n\n### [Table 5 around here]  \n\nThus far, we have documented that the presence of GVC in a given country influences the investments behavior of PVC investors. It is interesting to show that, instead, the niche of GVC 15  \n\ninvestors is not affected by their own density. For this purpose, we repeat the analysis on a sample of 284 GVC investments extracted from the VICO database. Table 6 shows the results of this analysis. Thevariable $\\%G V C$ is never significant, with only the partial exception of the Micro niche dimension, where it has a positive and weakly significant coefficient (p-value $\\times0.1$ ). We conclude that unlike PVC investments, GVC investment characteristics are not related to GVC's density.  \n\n[Table 6 around here]  \n\n## DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  \n\nIn this work, we have used the theoretical lenses of organizational ecology to examine how GVC's density influences PVC investors? investment behavior in a VC ecosystem. We have argued that GVC is a different species from PVC because of GVC's political objectives and distinct dominant competencies. Hence, GVC occupies a different niche from PVC. Moreover, it is inherent in the political mandate of GVC to establish mutualistic relationships with PVC, attracting PVC investors to companies they would otherwise neglect because of informational opaqueness, excessive investment risk and peripheral location. The strength of this attraction depends on GVC's density in the ecosystem. To test our predictions, we considered a random sample of VC investments in 7 European countries over the period 1994-2004. Our econometric results showed that in countries and years in which GVC was more strongly represented, PVC investors were more likely to invest in younger, smaller companies located in less-competitive regions. Because these companies are the typical target of GVC investors and are unattractive to PVC investors, we argue that these results confirm that GVC and PVC behave as organizational species in a mutualistic relationship. We also showed that syndication is one mechanism that GVC uses to attract PVC in its niche, but not the only one: even PVC investors that do not syndicate with GVC are more likely to invest in less-competitive regions and smaller companies when GVC's density is greater.  \n\nThis paper offers two main contributions to the VC literature. First, several recent studies have examined the impact of the GVC programs that have been set up by governments of several countries with the aim of closing the funding gap left by PVC. These studies have shown that in the effects of GVC financing on portfolio companies have been limited (Colombo, Cumming, & Vismara, 2016). Scholars have also questioned whether GVC crowds out PVC instead of attracting it to companies that need equity financing. The evidence at an aggregate level of analysis is mixed. The findings in Armour and Cumming (2006) and Cumming and Macintosh (2006) are consistent with a crowdingout effect in North America and Europe. Conversely, Jeng and Wells (2000), Leleux and Surlemont (2003), del-Palacio et al. (2012) and Brander et al. (2015) show that GVC positively affects the development of the VC industry. Studies using firm-level data also offer a positive view. Brander et al. (Brander et al., 2015) show that if GVC and PVC are both present in a company, the company receives a larger amount of VC investment than with GVC or PVC only. Guerini and Quas (2016) find that receiving GVC makes a firm three times more likely to receive PVC. Our study extends this latter stream of literature by investigating the changes triggered by the presence of GVC in a focal country in PVC investors′ investment behavior located in the same country (on this topic, see also Kovner and Lerner, 2015). Our findings show that in countries in which the presence of GVC is stronger, PVC investors are more inclined to invest in firms that they tend to neglect in the absence of GVC (young, small, located in less-competitive regions).  \n\nSecond, our study contributes to a small stream of studies that have applied the theoretical lens of the organizational ecology perspective to analyze VC, notably Manigart (1994) and Echols and Tsai (2005). In this study, we combine their theoretical perspectives. We discuss the niches of GVC and PVC, defined by the different characteristics of the companies in which these two VC species tend to invest, and consider how GVC's density influences PVC investors’ behavior, as reflected in their niche.  \n\nThis work has some limitations that open interesting avenues for future research. First, for the sake of brevity, we consider PVC a unique species. This species is quite heterogeneous, as it includes investors with different ownership and governance (Dimov & Gedajlovic, 2010), investment experience and network embeddedness. Scholars may wish to investigate whether differences among 17  \n\nPVC investors influence the strength of the mutualistic relationships they establish with GVC, or even give rise to competitive relationships. Similarly, not all GVC investors are alike (Jaaskelainen et al., 2007), and the design of GVC programs may influence the relationships between GVC and PVC. Second, we document empirically the existence of mutualistic relationships between GVC and PVC and show that they are not exclusively driven by syndication between the two investor types. If more detailed information were available, researchers could more closely examine the mechanisms that drive changes in PVC investment behavior, such as the certification effects of GVC investments or incentives to invest in particular companies or regions. Third, our work is based on 7 European countries. Extensions of this analysis to a larger number of countries, possibly including countries outside of Europe, would enable an examination of how institutional characteristics (e.g., investor protection, development of the stock market and the market for corporate control) moderate the intensity of the observed changes in PVC investments associated with GVC's density. Finally, data limitations force us to focus on four niche dimensions in this study. If additional information were available on the target companies selected by PVC investors, for instance, concerning the radicalness of the technology they were developing or their access to alternative financing channels such as business angels, crowdfunding or public subsidies, our analysis of the interaction between GVC and PVC could be made more comprehensive. Furthermore, future research may adopt a more detailed characterization of the niches’ dimensions. For instance, while we consider companies operating in biotechnology as a single niche, it has been shown that biotechnology is a very heterogeneous sector, characterized by several fields, which could be considered as distinct sub-niches (Knockaert, Manigart, Cattoir, & Verstraete, 2015). The non-significance of our results along the biotech niche dimension could be driven by this limitation.  \n\nDespite these limitations, our study has interesting policy implications. Our results highlight a positive effect of GVC that has previously been overlooked. Taking into consideration the widely documented positive effects of PVC on portfolio companies (Da Rin, Hellmann, & Puri, 2013), the fact that the presence of GVC makes PVC more inclined to invest in companies it would otherwise 18  \n\nneglect is good news for policymakers, and may offset the limited direct effects of GVC on portfolio companies. Accordingly, it would probably be wise to redefine the additionality of GVC programs in terms of their ability to redirect the “smart money” provided by PVC investors to companies that are most negatively affected by capital market imperfections.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nAnnoni, P.， & Dijkstra, L.

Firms choose their operating leverage trading off higher fixed costs for lower variable costs. Operating leverage governs frms’ exposures to an aggregate labor productivity shock. In equilibrium, firms exhibit excessive operating leverage as they do not internalize that an economy with higher aggregate operating leverage is more likely to fall into a recession following a negative productivity shock. Welfare losses coming from firms' failure to coordinate production are amplified by suboptimal risk-taking, which magnifies the impact of productivity shocks onto aggregate output.  \n\nKeywords: Operating leverage; Labor leverage; Coordination failure; Global games;   \nAggregate risk.  \n\nJEL classifcation: D24; D62; G01; E32  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nLabor leverage is a first-order determinant of firms’ risk as it creates a rigid cost structure that cannot be easily adjusted to demand shocks. For instance, Danthine and Donaldson (2002) note that the obligations originated by frms' labor force dwarf their financial obligations and provide evidence consistent with labor leverage generating undiversifiable risk. A subsequent stream of literature in asset pricing (e.g., Merz and Yashiv, 2007; Donangelo, Gourio, Kehrig, and Palacios, 2019; and Faviloukis, Lin, and Zhao, 2020) has shown that labor leverage has explanatory power in the pricing of equity and debt, both in the cross-section and in aggregate. In this paper, we endogenize frms' labor leverage decisions and study how these firm-level choices compound into aggregate risk. Specifically, labor leverage affects the likelihood that the economy falls into a Pareto-inferior equilibrium in which output is depressed and welfare is low. These episodes of coordination failure are interpreted as economic crises, in line with a long tradition in economics. While these crises are self-fulfilling in nature, the global games approach (e.g., Morris and Shin, 2000) suggests that their occurrence is anchored to fundamentals through firms′ exposure to a common productivity shock. We illustrate how this transmission channel operates through labor leverage and evaluate its implications for the risk of recessions and more broadly for welfare.  \n\nWe consider an imperfectly competitive economy with aggregate demand spillovers as in Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989). The economy is populated by consumers who supply labor to firms in different sectors. Labor is subject to a productivity shock, which is the only source of risk in this economy. Firms are collectively owned by consumers and use labor as their sole input to produce final goods. Each sector has a competitive fringe of firms with a constant returns to scale technology and a unique large firm with an increasing returns to scale technology. Increasing returns to scale generates strategic complementarities across sectors: higher profits in one firm trickle down to consumers and stimulate their demand for goods in other sectors. Higher demand, in turn, allows firms in other sectors to leverage their increasing returns to scale technologies and increase their own profits.  \n\nImportantly, we allow large firms to adjust their cost structure ex ante. For instance, in Chaney and Ossa (2013), firms organize production by choosing their division of labor, which trades off fixed versus marginal costs. A greater division of labor is associated to higher labor leverage. We interpret labor leverage as an enduring technological and organizational choice, consistent with the idea that adjustments to the size and structure of the labor force within a firm requires time and involves sizeable costs. More specifically, at the initial date, each firm chooses its labor leverage, trading off higher fixed labor costs for lower variable labor costs. Labor leverage determines the exposure of a frm's profits to the aggregate productivity shock. On the one hand, when demand is high, a firm benefits from higher leverage as it can produce at a lower average cost. On the other hand, higher leverage, by raising fixed labor costs, makes a firm more vulnerable to a drop in demand. At that final date, the productivity shock is realized and large firms set prices to maximize profits given the threat from the competitive fringe. A firm, however, retains the option to leave the market following a negative productivity shock if it expects demand to be insufficient  \n\nto cover its fixed costs.  \n\nFinally, we assume that tasks in large firms are subject to moral hazard. This is consistent with the idea that in larger and more complex organizations, information frictions create room for opportunistic behavior. Similar to Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989), it is the combination of demand externalities and this labor friction that ultimately creates scope for coordination failures. Specifically, the presence of moral hazard requires large frms to pay a premium over the wage in the competitive fringe, and these firms fail to internalize the demand spillovers that higher wages have on the rest of the economy. As a result, in the final date, the economy can be trapped in an equilibrium in which large firms exit and output is inefficiently low.  \n\nThe main contribution of the paper is to show that coordination failures at the production stage contaminate ex ante risk-taking decisions and generate excessive labor leverage in aggregate. We derive this result in two steps. First, we study production decisions at the final date and show that when labor productivity falls below a threshold, coordination motives generate a sharp transition from a Pareto-optimal production outcome in which large firms reap the benefits of increasing returns to scale, to a Pareto-inferior outcome in which large firms cease to operate. Importantly, we also show that this endogenous operating threshold is higher when firms? aggregate labor leverage increases, that is, an increase in labor leverage increases the likelihood of a coordination failure.  \n\nWe then turn to ex ante labor leverage decisions. When setting their labor leverages, firms take into account their option to cease operations when demand is low. Because of this option, frms optimize leverage over the states in which they anticipate being active. Coordination problems make it less likely for large firms to survive a bad productivity shock, which tilts each firm's optimization program towards higher-productivity states. In these states, the return to labor leverage is higher, so that aggregate labor leverage rises when the production-stage coordination problem worsens. We show that the equilibrium labor leverage is constrained inefficient: a social planner that takes the production-stage equilibrium as given could increase welfare by forcing all frms to lower their labor leverage. The welfare loss caused by excess labor leverage occurs through a shift of the output distribution towards high-productivity states that comes at the cost of higher downside risk and lower expected output. Intuitively, each firm chooses its labor leverage taking the aggregate labor leverage as given. Hence, firms do not internalize that their collective decision to increase labor leverage raises the coordination threshold, making it more likely that the economy coordinates on a Pareto-inferior regime with depressed output.  \n\nThe excessive labor leverage is inherently related to the existence of a coordination failure. To formally make this point, we also study a case without coordination failures, that is, a case in which we allow firms to coordinate on the Pareto-superior equilibrium at the production stage. As mentioned earlier, atomistic frms do not internalize that a collective decrease in leverage would widen the range of states in which production takes place. However, when firms coordinate on the Pareto-superior equilibrium, production decisions are optimal ex post and hence, the social value of producing in the marginal state (at the production threshold) is exactly zero. Therefore, a marginal decrease in aggregate labor leverage would extend production to a state where it brings no social value. In that case, the equilibrium leverage is constrained effcient. By contrast, when there is a coordination failure at the production stage, there exists a region just below the production threshold where the net value of all frms switching from inaction to production is strictly positive.  \n\nOur paper builds on a stream of literature in economics that grounds low aggregate output realizations into coordination failures. (See Diamond, 1982; Hart, 1982; and Weitzman, 1982, for early contributions.) Cooper and John (1988) provide a general framework to analyze economies in which agents’ actions are strategic complements. In our paper, demand complementarities originate from a combination of imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale technologies as in Shleifer and Vishny (1988), Kiyotaki (1988) and Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989). Lamont (1995) shows that coordination failures arise with imperfect competition but constant returns to scale economy when firms can suffer from debt overhang. The common feature in these papers is the existence of multiple self-fulfilling equilibria that can be Pareto-ranked. While this illustrates how economies can be trapped into inferior low-output equilibria, equilibrium indeterminacy precludes a meaningful analysis of firms’ ex ante risk-exposure decisions, the objective of our paper.  \n\nTo overcome this problem, we take advantage of global games techniques. As shown in Carlsson and Van Damme (1993), introducing dispersed information in games of strategic complementarities can lead to a unique equilibrium prediction pinned down by the realization of an underlying economic fundamental. Chamley (1999) and Bebchuk and Goldstein (2011) use this insight to study economies in which agents’ investment decisions exhibit a generic form of complementarity. Schaal and Taschereau-Dumouchel (2018) introduce global games in a dynamic model with demand complementarities and show how transitory shocks can trigger long-lasting periods of depressed investment and recession. Guimaraes and Morris (2008) show that risk-averse agents’ exposures to an underlying source of risk affect the outcome of the coordination game they play. Our contribution to this body of literature is to endogenize risk-taking; that is, agents’ exposures to the underlying common risk factor.  \n\nOur paper is also related to the literature on operating leverage and firms’ risk initiated by Lev (1974). More specifically, a stream of papers in fnance focuses on labor leverage, building on the premise that labor is the main fixed component of firms′ cost structures. Danthine and Donaldson (2002) note that labor generates obligations for firms that are of an order of magnitude greater than their financial obligations, and that the labor share is countercyclical. These empirical observations motivate a general equilibrium model in which labor leverage creates nondiversifiable risk for equity holders. Subsequent papers have shown labor leverage to be positively related to CAPM beta, stock volatility, credit risk, and procyclicality of profits in a cross-section of firms. (See, for instance, Donangelo, Gourio, Kehrig, and Palacios, 2019 and Faviloukis, Lin, and Zhao, 2020.) Merz and Yashiv (2007) show that the shape and magnitude of labor adjustment costs effectively makes hiring conceptually similar to an investment. These empirical findings lend support to the mechanism at play in the model where operating leverage is driven by labor costs and constitutes a structural long-term choice that affects a frm's exposure to aggregate risk.  \n\nFinally, there is a large body of literature that studies the relation between financial frictions and economic crises. (See, for instance, Bernanke and Gertler, 1989; Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997; Lorenzoni, 2008; Gorton and Ordonez, 2014; and He and Kondor, 2016.) This literature highlights the role of fnancial frictions (e.g., credit constraints arising from contract incompleteness） in generating and amplifying crises. While the role of financial leverage in economic crises has been extensively studied, the role of operating leverage has received less attention. This is despite the fact that financial distress is typically preceded by economic distress, and despite the importance of frms non-financial obligations in comparison to their financial obligations. For instance, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, employee compensation for US non-financial corporations in 2018, \\$5,946 billions, amounted to 17 times their net interest payments, \\$33 billions. The nature of operating leverage and fnancial leverage are also markedly distinct: frms may change their capital structure by going to the capital market or through renegotiation, whereas operating leverage is a structural choice that cannot be adjusted in the short run. Moreover, frms can use financial markets to hedge against the costs associated to financial risk. In contrast, financial markets are of limited use in managing operating risk as hedging does not change the cost structure and therefore, whether firms create or destroy value. Our paper suggests that these fundamental technological and organizational choices at the frm level can have outsized aggregate effects in economies subject to coordination failures.  \n\n## 2. Model  \n\nWe consider a unit interval of identical consumers with a utility function $\\begin{array}{r}{\\exp\\left[{\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln x(q)d q}\\right]}\\end{array}$ defined over a unit interval of goods indexed by $q$ . Each consumer is endowed with $L$ units of labor that he supplies inelastically, so $L$ is also the total amount of labor in the economy. $L$ is drawn from a uniform distribution over $[0,\\overline{{L}}]$ , and the realization of $L$ is interpreted as an economy-wide labor productivity shock, the only source of risk in this economy. To ensure the existence of equilibria in which agents’ optimization problems have interior solutions, we take the upper bound, $\\overline{{L}}$ , to be large enough, in a sense we make precise in the Appendix (for most results, $\\overline{{L}}>2$  \n\nEach good $q$ is produced by a sector, and each sector consists of two types of frms. A competitive fringe of firms with a constant returns to scale technology in which one unit of output requires one unit of labor, and a unique firm, a monopolist, with access to an increasing returns to scale technology. To produce, monopolist $q$ incurs a fixed cost of $\\begin{array}{r}{F(s_{q})=\\frac{s_{q}}{\\alpha-s_{q}}}\\end{array}$ units of labor and a constant marginal cost of $\\alpha-s_{q}$ units of labor per unit of output. We assume $\\alpha<1$ , and take $s_{q}\\in[0,\\alpha]$ to be a choice variable that captures operating leverage: by increasing $s_{q}$ , monopolist $q$ reduces its marginal labor cost $\\alpha-s_{q}$ at the expense of inflating its fixed labor cost $F(s_{q})$ 1  The model is closed by assuming that consumers own all the profits and that each frm maximizes expected profits where the workers’ wage per unit of labor is taken as the numeraire.2  \n\nConsistent with the literature on labor leverage surveyed in the introduction, we interpret levera.ge $s_{q}$ as a structural, long-term choice that regulates monopolist $q$ 's cost structure in future production periods. As originally illustrated by Adam Smith's famous pin factory example, a key decision in the organization of production is the division of labor, which he argued to be limited by the market size. Chaney and Ossa (2013) provide a formalization of Adam Smith's argument. In their model, frms choose their division of labor trading off fixed and marginal costs. Specifically, a greater number of teams, which would allow for a greater division of labor, is associated with higher fixed costs but lower marginal costs. (Each team bears a fixed cost but having more teams allows each team to perform a narrower range of tasks around a core competency.) As the expected size of the market increases, firms choose a greater division of labor, that is, a production technology with higher operating leverage.  \n\nTo capture the enduring quality of these long-term technological and organizational choices and therefore, that frms cannot respond to a productivity shock by swiftly changing their production technologies, we assume that each monopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ at $t=0$ , before the realization of the productivity shock and the production decisions at $t=1$ .At $t=1$ ， the final period, $L$ , is realized, and all firms decide how much to produce and at which price to sell. Note that monopolist $q$ may decide not to produce upon learning $L$ . In that case, it saves the fixed cost $F(s_{q})$ , but abandons production in sector $q$ to the competitive fringe. Hence, labor cost $F(s_{q})$ is fixed rather than sunk as, for instance, in Maskin and Tirole (1988): “Ficed costs (measured as a flow) persist only as long as production continues, but are, strictly speaking, independent of scale. Pure sunk costs . . . are incurred with or without production.\"” Therefore, the irreversibility in the model is in the labor leverage choice, $s_{q}$ that is, in the frm's choice of its technology.  \n\nFinally, we assume that production by monopolists requires monitoring that needs to be incentivized. Specifically, a subset of the workers hired by each monopolist performs supervisory functions, where each supervisor is responsible for a share of the firm's production. If a supervisor exerts monitoring effort, each unit produced under his supervision is functional, but he incurs a personal cost $\\beta$ per unit.3 If a supervisor does not exert effort, units are defective and worthless to consumers. Quality is contractible, and we assume that $\\alpha+\\beta<1$ , So that the overall marginal cost is still lower when a monopolist produces than when the competitive fringe does. This specification is consistent with monopolists being larger, more sophisticated organizations in which division of labor and information frictions require supervisory tasks of a different nature than the tasks required in small fringe firms. For instance, Garicano and Van Zandt (2012) reviews a body of literature in which hierarchies and division of labor jointly emerge as a response to costly information processing. This monitoring friction is also isomorphic to the assumption in Murphy,  \n\nShleifer, and Vishny (1989) who posit that workers experience a disutility when working for monopolist firms rather than for firms in the competitive fringe, as we discuss in Section 5.1. The disutility in Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989) is in the spirit of Rosenstein-Rodan (1943), capturing the idea that to bring farm laborers to work in a factory, a frm must pay them a wage premium. While their specification is tailored to developing economies where a \"big push” can jump-start development, our specification has a more natural interpretation in developed economies where business cycles are amplified by coordination failures. As in Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989), the role of this assumption is to generate equilibrium multiplicity and the possibility of a coordination failure at the production stage. This allows us to study the relation between coordination failures in production at $t=1$ and risk-taking decisions at $t=0$ , the objective of this paper. As will become clear below (Proposition 4), our results are not related to the monitoring friction per se, but to the possibility of a coordination failure.  \n\nFig. 1 below illustrates the timing of events. Notice that production only takes place at $t=1$ , after the realization of the productivity shock $L$ . A setup in which firms produce both at $t=0$ and at $t=1$ would produce qualitatively similar results, provided that monopolists cannot change their chosen technologies between the two periods. (See the Online Appendix for such case.) In other words, what is important for our results is that monopolists cannot respond to the productivity shock by quickly changing their production technologies at $t=1$ ; that is, that firms’ technological and organizational choices are long lasting. As we will show, this causes monopolists’ choices of operating leverage ex ante ( $t=0$ ) to affect the probability of a coordination failure ex post ( $t=1$  \n\n![](images/7b738b8ba323e32c90dd80baa842ed334e7337762ecbf69e3c7f985d4974693f.jpg)  \nFig. 1. Timing of events  \n\n## 3. Coordination failures and excess operating leverage  \n\n3.1. Demand ecternalities and equilibrium multiplicity  \n\nThe analysis of the final period ( $t=1$ )is analogous to the one in Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989). A reader familiar with their analysis could jump to Lemma 1 below, which summarizes a result equivalent to the one in their paper, and which we take as a building block.  \n\nEach consumer buys the consumption basket $\\{\\boldsymbol{x}(\\boldsymbol{q})\\}_{\\boldsymbol{q}\\in[0,1]}$ that maximizes his utility given prices $\\{p(q)\\}_{q\\in[0,1]}$ and his available income $y$  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{\\{x(q)\\}_{q\\in[0,1]}}\\exp\\left[\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln x(q)d q\\right]\\mathrm{s.t.}\\int_{0}^{1}p(q)x(q)=y.\n$$  \n\nAt optimum, consumers spend equally on each good,that is they buy quantity r(q) = of good $q$  \n\nMonopolist $q$ sets price $p(q)$ to maximize profit given demand  \n\n$$\nx(q)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{y}{p(q)}}}&{\\mathrm{if}p(q)\\leq1,}\\ {\\quad}\\ {0}&{\\mathrm{if}p(q)>1.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nNote that the monopolist is priced out if it sets $p(q)>1$ : since the competitive fringe can produce one unit of good $q$ with one unit of labor whose wage is the numeraire, the price in the competitive fringe is equal to one. Given the demand function in Eq. (2), if monopolist $q$ is active, it sets the highest price that generates a positive demand, $p(q)=1$ ， and produces $x(q)=y$ units of output. Because monitoring requires effort, supervisors have to be paid a premium over the wage in the competitive fringe. Since quality is contractible, and since the probability of producing a functional unit without monitoring effort is zero, promising a bonus $\\beta$ conditional on delivering a functioning unit is sufficient to incentivize monitoring, and only compensates the supervisor for his monitoring cost. The profit of an active monopolist, given that $p(q)=1$ and $x(q)=y$ , is then  \n\n$$\n\\pi_{q}=(1-\\beta-\\alpha+s_{q})y-F(s_{q}).\n$$  \n\nMonopolist $q$ is active when $\\pi_{q}\\geq0$ . Consumption and production decisions endogenously determine aggregate income at $t=1$ . Specifically, aggregate income, or equivalently, aggre  \n\ngate output, is the sum of corporate profits and labor income,  \n\n$$\ny=\\int_{q\\in{\\mathcal{A}}}\\left[\\left(1-\\beta-\\alpha+s_{q}\\right)y-F(s_{q})\\right]d q+L+\\int_{q\\in{\\mathcal{A}}}\\beta y d q,\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\mathcal{A}}\\subset[0,1]$ is the set of sectors in which a monopolist is active at $t=1$ ：From Eq. (4), monitoring does not affect aggregate income $y$ for a given set of active monopolists $\\mathcal{A}$ : monitoring reduces the profit of each active monopolist by $\\beta y$ but increases labor income by the same amount. Rearranging Eq. (4) we obtain  \n\n$$\ny=\\frac{L-\\int_{q\\in A}F(s_{q})~d q}{1-\\int_{q\\in A}[1-\\alpha+s_{q}]~d q}.\n$$  \n\nFrom Eq. (5), we can derive the marginal impact on output $y$ of monopolist $i$ joining the set of active monopolists $\\mathcal{A}$ 4..  \n\n$$\nd y=\\frac{\\pi_{i}(y)+\\beta y}{1-\\int_{q\\in\\cal{A}}[1-\\alpha+s_{q}]d q}d i.\n$$  \n\nThis expression captures an important intuition for production decisions at $t=1$ :the contribution of the marginal active monopolist $i$ to output is that monopolist's profit $\\pi_{i}(y)$ plus the paid wage premium $\\beta y$ amplified by a multiplier $\\textstyle(1-\\int_{q\\in{\\cal A}}1-\\alpha+s_{q}d q)^{-1}$ , which is strictly greater than one as long as the set of active monopolists $\\mathcal{A}$ has a positive mass. This multiplier captures a demand ecternality: when $\\pi_{i}(y)+\\beta y$ is positive, the profit and the wage premium stimulates demand for other goods, which allows other active monopolists to take advantage of their increasing returns to scale technologies and increase their own profits.  \n\nNote that monopolist $i$ , by becoming active, generates $\\beta y$ as compensation for the supervisors′ monitoring cost, in addition to profit $\\pi_{i}(y)$ . Factoring in this monitoring cost $\\beta y$ in Eq. (6), the net impact of monopolist $\\imath$ 's decision to become active on consumers′ utility is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi_{i}(y)+\\beta y}{1-\\int_{q\\in\\cal A}[1-\\alpha+s_{q}]d q}-\\beta y.\n$$  \n\nThis expression shows how the demand multiplier $\\textstyle(1-\\int_{q\\in{\\cal A}}1-\\alpha+s_{q}d q)^{-1}$ and the monitoring cost $\\beta y$ combine to create a wedge between private and social incentives. The sign of a monopolist's profit $\\pi_{i}(y)$ and the sign of its impact on welfare (i.e., the sign of Eq. (7)) coincide if there is no multiplier (i.e., ${\\mathcal{A}}=\\{\\emptyset\\}$ $\\begin{array}{r}{(1-\\int_{q\\in\\mathcal{A}}1-\\alpha+s_{q}d q)^{-1}=1}\\end{array}$ ) in which case Eq. (7) reduces to $\\pi_{i}(y)$ . The misalignment of private and social incentives arises when $\\beta>0$ and a strictly positive mass of monopolists is active. In that case, monopolist $i$ internalizes the monitoring cost $\\beta y$ through the wage premium it pays, but not the multiplier effect of that additional compensation on the demand to other active monopolists $\\mathcal{A}$ . Specifically, if $\\begin{array}{r}{\\pi_{i}(y)<0<(\\pi_{i}(y)+\\beta y)(1-\\int_{q\\in A}1-\\alpha+s_{q}d q)^{-1}-\\beta y}\\end{array}$ , it is individually optimal for monopolist $i$ to leave the market, yet its net effect on consumers’ utility if it were to produce would be positive (i.e., Eq. (7) would be greater than zero).  \n\nThis misalignment creates scope for coordination failures. Consider the case in which all monopolists choose the same operating leverage $s$ at $t=0$ . Then, combining Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), a monopolist does not operate if no other monopolist operates (if ${\\mathcal{A}}=\\lbrace\\emptyset\\rbrace$ )when  \n\n$$\nL<{\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}.\n$$  \n\nConversely, a monopolist operates if all other monopolists operate (if $\\mathcal{A}=[0,1]$ )when  \n\n$$\nL>\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}.\n$$  \n\nTherefore, if  \n\n$$\nL\\in\\left({\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}},{\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\right),\n$$  \n\na high-output equilibrium in which all monopolists are active coexists with a low-output equilibrium in which the fringe takes over production. That second equilibrium is Paretodominated and embodies a coordination failure: each monopolist does not internalize that its individual decision to produce and pay a wage premium increases demand and hence, the other monopolists’ profits from producing. We summarize this discussion in the next lemma.  \n\nLemma 1. If all monopolists choose the same operating leverage at $t=0$ , then at $t=1$ : (i) $\\begin{array}{r}{L>\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ all monopolists operate;(i）if $\\begin{array}{r}{L<\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ , no monopolist operates; and (i）i $\\begin{array}{r}{L\\in\\left(\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s},\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}\\right)}\\end{array}$ , there is one equlibrium in which all monopolists operate  \n\n### 3.2. Global games and the production threshold  \n\nWhile the presence of multiple equilibria captures the idea of a coordination failure, the indeterminacy at the production stage at $t=1$ precludes the analysis of the operating leverage decision at $t=0$ .To resolve this indeterminacy, we now depart from Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989) and apply a global games treatment. This is done by introducing dispersed information: at $t=1$ , each monopolist $q$ observes a noisy signal of $L$ ， $\\boldsymbol{l}_{q}=\\boldsymbol{L}+\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{q}$ ， where $\\xi_{q}$ is independent across monopolists and uniformly distributed on $[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon]$ . One can show there is no loss of generality in restricting attention to threshold strategies in which monopolist $q$ operates at $t=1$ if $l_{q}$ is above a threshold $l^{*}$ . Then, for a given $L$ , the mass of active monopolists is  \n\n$$\nn(L)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{1}}&{{\\mathrm{if}L>l^{*}+\\varepsilon}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\frac{L+\\varepsilon-l^{*}}{2\\varepsilon}}}&{{\\mathrm{if}L\\in[l^{*}-\\varepsilon,l^{*}+\\varepsilon]}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{0}}&{{\\mathrm{if}L<l^{*}-\\varepsilon}}\\end{array}\\right..\n$$  \n\nWhen observing ${\\mathit{l}}_{q}={\\mathit{l}}^{*}$ , monopolist $q$ must be indifferent between producing or not,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}\\int_{l^{*}-\\varepsilon}^{l^{*}+\\varepsilon}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L-n(L)F(s)}{1-n(L)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F(s)d L=0,\n$$  \n\nwhich uniquely pins down $l^{*}$ . Finally, a well-known property of global games is that equilibrium uniqueness carries over to the asymptotic case in which the noise in the signals vanishes, $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ , and the information structure becomes arbitrarily close to common knowledge. In that case, solving for $l^{*}$ in Eq. (12) delivers the threshold on the underlying state $L$ above which production takes place,  \n\n$$\nL^{T}(s)\\equiv\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s}+\\frac{\\beta F(s)}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s}\\right)}.\n$$  \n\nProposition 1. If all monopolists choose operating leverage s at $t=0$ and $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ , then all monopolists operate at $t=1$ f $L\\geq L^{T}(s)$ and no monopolist operates at $t=1$ if $L<L^{T}(s)$  \n\nThe production equilibrium in Proposition 1 has two important features. First, the equilibrium bears an economically intuitive relation to fundamentals: monopolists are more likely to operate for higher realizations of the productivity shock $L$ . Notice that the production threshold belongs to the region in which multiple equilibria previously coexisted: $\\begin{array}{r}{L^{T}(s)\\in\\left(\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s},\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}\\right)}\\end{array}$ inferior equilibrium for (@-F, LT(s), that is, for the lower realizations of the productivity shock, thereby maintaining scope for coordination failures. Second, the production threshold $L^{T}(s)$ is increasing in aggregate operating leverage $s$ :a more levered economy needs a higher productivity shock to coordinate on the production equilibrium at $t=1$ ; that is, operating leverage aggravates the coordination problem. Note also that, if monopolists were to choose zero operating leverage, there would no coordination failures at $t=1$ as monopolists would always produce (i.e., $L^{T}(0)=0$ ). Therefore, coordination failures will endogenously arise in the model because of monopolists? incentives to take on operating leverage. Next, we build on Proposition $^{1}$ to analyze these incentives and to derive the equilibrium operating leverage at $t=0$  \n\n### 3.3. Equilibrium operating leverage  \n\nThe distinct feature in our model is to allow each monopolist $q$ to calibrate its exposure to the aggregate shock $L$ through the choice of operating leverage $s_{q}$ ; that is, we endogenize risk-taking. To build intuition on the relation between operating leverage and risk, we start with two simple observations.  \n\nFirst, monopolist $q$ only produces at $t=1$ if $\\pi_{q}\\geq0$ , which, from Eq. (3), requires demand to be high enough: y ≥ 1-a-β+sa F-8)s. This income threshold, 1-a-B+sa' , increases with $s_{q}$ :a monopolist with higher operating leverage needs higher demand to cover its fixed cost $F(s_{q})$ ， and hence is more likely to exit the market at $t=1$ . The adverse effect of operating leverage on profits can extend to states in which demand is high enough to allow the monopolist to operate (i.e., $\\pi_{q}\\geq0$ ) yet too low for the lower marginal costs to outweigh the higher fixed costs: $\\frac{\\partial\\pi_{q}}{\\partial s_{q}}<0$ $\\begin{array}{r}{y<\\frac{\\alpha}{(\\alpha-s_{q})^{2}}}\\end{array}$ However, as dmad irea futh, highe lvera oms beneficial: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\pi_{q}}{\\partial s_{q}}>0}\\end{array}$ >Oify> $\\begin{array}{r}{y>\\frac{\\alpha}{(\\alpha-s_{q})^{2}}}\\end{array}$ . Intuitively, operating leverage magnifies the impact of demand shocks on profts, ,  = Sq, and therefore is more aluable when demand is high. Second, shocks to demand $y$ are driven by shocks to labor productivity $L$ , as is apparent in Eq. (5). Operating leverage affects the relation between monopolists’ profits and this  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial\\pi_{q}}{\\partial L}=\\frac{\\partial\\pi_{q}}{\\partial y}.\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial L}}\\end{array}$ g = sq, is the direct exposure of profits $\\pi_{q}$ to demand $y$ , as discussed in the previous paragraph. The second one, $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial L}=(1-\\int_{i\\in A}1-\\alpha+s_{i}d i)^{-1}}\\end{array}$ , captures that shocks to $L$ are amplified by the demand multiplier, which itself depends on all active monopolists? leverages, $\\{s_{i}\\}_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}$ . Hence, through demand externalities, a monopolist's leverage affects the transmission of productivity shock $L$ to aggregate demand $y$ , and therefore, the sensitivity of all other monopolists’ profits to this productivity shock. Via this demand externality channel, firms’ leverage decisions become interdependent and jointly determine aggregate risk.  \n\nWe analyze operating leverage decisions, focusing on symmetric equilibria. Specifically, suppose all monopolists choose non-cooperatively the same operating leverage $s$ at $t=0$ From Proposition 1, aggregate income is then given by  \n\n$$\ny(s,L)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\frac{L-F(s)}{\\alpha-s}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L\\geq L^{T}(s)}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{.}}&{{}}\\ {{L}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L<L^{T}(s)}}\\end{array}\\right..\n$$  \n\nIf monopolist $q$ were to choose operating leverage $s_{q}$ while all other monopolists choose $s$ monopolist $q$ would make a profit, and hence, produce when  \n\n$$\n\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s,L)-F(s_{q})\\geq0,\n$$  \n\nor equivalently, when  \n\n$$\nL\\geq\\hat{L}(s_{q},s)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\operatorname*{max}\\bigg\\{(\\alpha-s)\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}+F(s),L^{T}(s)\\bigg\\}}&{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\geq s,}\\ {~}\\ {L\\geq\\hat{L}(s_{q},s)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\mathrm{id}_{\\alpha}\\geq0}&{\\mathrm{id}_{\\beta}\\leq s_{q}}\\ {~}\\ {\\mathrm{id}_{\\alpha}\\geq\\beta+s_{q}}&{\\mathrm{id}^{T}(s)\\leq s.}\\end{array}\\right.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThen $s^{*}$ is an equilibrium if and only if  \n\n$$\ns^{*}\\in\\underset{s_{q}}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*}),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L)-F(s_{q})d L.\n$$  \n\nThe next proposition follows from this condition.  \n\nProposition 2. There exists a unique symmetric equilibrium $s^{*}$ definedby  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[y|L\\ge L^{T}(s^{*})\\right]-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)=0.\n$$  \n\nTo understand the condition in Eq. (18), note that, from Eq. (17), operating leverage $s_{q}$ affects monopolist $q$ 's profit through two margins. The frst one is an extensive margin: changing $s_{q}$ affects monopolist $q$ 's production threshold $\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})$ at $t=1$ , namely, the lower bound of the integral in Eq. (17). The extensive margin, $\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})$ , does not enter the monopolist's frst order condition in Eq. (18). Intuitively, at $\\hat{L}(s^{*},s^{*})=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , monopolist $q$ 's profit is strictly positive only because other monopolists also produce. As $L$ falls below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ and other monopolists stop producing, monopolist $q$ 's profit from producing turns strictly negative, and the monopolist is better off stopping production as well. This holds when $s_{q}=s^{*}$ , but also, by continuity, for a range of values of $s_{q}$ below $s^{*}$ . Conversely, monopolist $q$ is better off producing at $L^{T}(s^{*})$ for a range of values of $s_{q}$ above $s^{*}$ . The rigidity of $\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})$ with respect to $s_{q}$ around $s^{*}$ reflects the strength of strategic complementarities around the production threshold, which underlines the coordination failure. Consequently, the only relevant margin is an intensive one: changing $s_{q}$ affects monopolist $q$ 's profit taking the states in which it produces (i.e., the bounds of the integral in Eq. (17) as fixed. The condition in Eq. (18) states that there are no marginal gains in terms of profits along that intensive margin when monopolist $q$ chooses $s^{*}$ and produces for $L$ above $L^{T}(s^{*})=\\hat{L}(s^{*},s^{*})$ Note that this marginal reasoning only provides a necessary condition for optimality. Specifically, gains along the extensive margin become non-negligible as $s_{q}$ moves further away from $s^{*}$ . The proof of Proposition 2 in the Appendix shows that these large deviations can also be ruled out.  \n\nA key aspect in the above analysis is that the coordination failure at $t=1$ is unaffected by a unilateral change in leverage; that is, the leverage and production decisions of a single monopolist have a negligible effect on the aggregate income and therefore, on the production decisions of all the other monopolists at $t=1$ . We now ask whether welfare could improve if a social planner were to choose all monopolists' leverage. Specifically, we define the optimal leverage $s^{o p t}$ as the one maximizing consumers′ expected utility at $t=0$ given that monopolists behave at $t=1$ as per Proposition 1. Our social optimum is therefore constrained efficient: the social planner chooses leverage at $t=0$ but cannot avoid coordination failures at $t=1$ . Note finally that the extra labor income $\\beta y$ earned by supervisors in states in which monopolists are active merely compensates them for their effort cost and, therefore, labor income net of monitoring disutility always sums up to $L$ . Consequently, maximizing consumers′ expected utility amounts to maximizing their expected income from corporate profits:  \n\n$$\ns^{o p t}\\in\\underset{s}{\\arg\\operatorname*{max}}\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L^{T}(s),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s\\right)y(s,L)-F(s)d L.\n$$  \n\nProposition 3. In the symmetric equilibrium, there is eccessive operating leverage: $s^{*}>$ sopt.  \n\nTo understand why equilibrium leverage is excessive, consider the first order derivative of the social planner objective function in Eq. (19) with respect to $s$ 5  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\int_{L^{T}(s)}^{\\overline{{L}}}y(s,L)-F^{\\prime}(s)d L+\\displaystyle\\int_{L^{T}(s)}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s\\right)\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial s}(s,L)d L}\\ {-\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial L^{T}(s)}{\\partial s}[(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)y(s,L^{T}(s))-F(s)].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis derivative has three terms. The first one corresponds to the impact of leverage on each monopolist's profit, given that a monopolist produces for $L\\geq L^{T}(s)$ . From Eq. (18), this term is zero at $s=s^{*}$ : each monopolist optimizes along the intensive margin in equilibrium. The second term captures the demand externality that each monopolist exerts by stimulating demand $y$ for other active monopolists when $L\\geq L^{T}(s)$ .From Eq. (7), the equilibrium impact of monopolist $q$ on $y$ is $\\pi_{q}+\\beta y$ times a demand multiplier $(\\alpha-s^{*})^{-1}$ .(The equilibrium demand multiplier is $(\\alpha-s^{*})^{-1}$ for $L\\geq L^{T}(s)$ and $^{1}$ for $L<L^{T}(s)$ ) The monopolist does not internalize that the demand multiplier, $(\\alpha-s^{*})^{-1}$ , amplifies the contribution of its profit to output. However, because the equilibrium demand multiplier is constant for $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ , monopolist $q$ , when choosing $s_{q}$ to maximize its expected profit $\\pi_{q}$ along the intensive margin, also maximizes the expected externality it exerts on other monopolists across all states $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ . As a result, the second term in Eq. (20) also cancels out when evaluated at the equilibrium leverage: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial s}(s^{*},L)d L=0}\\end{array}$ ， The equilibrium ineffciency goes through the impact of leverage on the lower bound of the monopolists’ production region $L^{T}(s)$ , which is captured by the third term in Eq. (20). As discussed earlier, if a monopolist were to unilaterally lower its leverage marginally, it would not produce in the neighborhood below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ at $t=1$ , as it anticipates all other monopolists will remain inactive. However, if a social planner constrains all monopolists to lower their operating leverage, coordination in production at $t=1$ changes: $\\frac{\\partial L^{\\prime}(s)}{\\partial s}>0$ . Specifically,. at the equilibrium leverage $s^{*}$ , a marginal decrease in the leverage of all monopolists lead them to switch from inactivity to production just below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ . Because $L^{T}(s^{*})$ belongs to the region in which monopolists being inactive is Pareto-dominated, inducing all of them to produce in that marginal state improves welfare by the corresponding aggregate profit $(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*})y(s,L^{T}(s^{*}))-F(s^{*})>0$ . In other words, if monopolists could collectively commit to lowering their leverage at $t=0$ , they would increase their expected profits and raise welfare by expanding the range of states in which they coordinate on the Paretosuperior production decision at $t=1$ . They, however, have no unilateral incentive to do SO.  \n\nIt follows from the above discussion, that the excessive leverage result in Proposition 3 is inherently related to the monopolists? failure to coordinate production below $L^{T}(s)$ at $t=1$ In fact, our model establishes a direct relationship between the possibility of coordination failures at $t=1$ and the efficiency of the risk-taking decision at $t=0$ . To see this, consider the equilibrium in Lemma 1 and instead of applying a global games treatment, suppose monopolists always coordinate on the Pareto-superior production equilibrium; that is, assuming that for any common lverage s, frms produce at t =lif and only if L≥  \n\nProposition 4. If frms coordinate on the Pareto-superior production equilibrium at $t=1$ and a symmetric operating leverage equilibrium exists, it is unique and socially optimal.  \n\nProposition 4 highlights that constrained inefficiency in Proposition 3 is not related to the monitoring friction per se: equilibrium leverage is socially optimal with $\\beta>0$ as long as monopolists coordinate on the Pareto-superior equilibrium at $t=1$ . Hence, the possibility of coordination failures at $t=1$ , rather than their origin in itself, is what really matters for the excessive leverage result. In other words, the role in the model of the monitoring cost $\\beta$ is to create scope for these inefficient production outcomes at $t=1$ , but other sources of coordination failures can lead to the same result. Intuitively, absent coordination failures, the net social value of monopolists producing in the marginal state, that is at $\\begin{array}{r}{L=\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ is equal to zero. By contrast, the net social value of monopolists producing at $L^{T}(s^{*})$ is strictly positive, which refects the coordination failure. This strictly positive value at  \n\n$L^{T}(s^{*})$ creates the social benefit of lowering aggregate leverage to extend production below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ , which monopolists fail to internalize.  \n\nThe inefficiency in Proposition 3 is a statement on the first moment of the output distribution: excessive operating leverage causes expected output to be lower in equilibrium than in the constrained optimum. Our model also shows that this loss in expected output compounds differential effects across states: output is actually higher than in the social optimum for high realizations of the productivity shock, but lower for low realizations. In addition, the transition from a Pareto-superior equilibrium with high production to the Pareto-inferior one with low production occurs through a larger drop in output in equilibrium than in the constrained optimum. This result is the combination of two forces: first, the economy is more levered in equilibrium than in the social optimum, $s^{*}>s^{o p t}$ ; and second, the drop into a low-production regime occurs for a higher realization of the productivity shock, $L^{T}(s^{*})>L^{T}(s^{o p t})$ . Summing up, the welfare loss caused by excess leverage occurs through a shift of the output distribution towards high-productivity states that comes at the cost of higher downside risk and lower expected output.  \n\n### 3.4. Evidence and empirical implications  \n\nIn the model, strategic complementarities are associated with demand spillovers, which is in line with the Keynesian narrative that attributes the bulk of business cycles to shifts in aggregate demand. Blanchard and Quah (1989) use structural VARs to provide evidence in support of the idea that business cycles are driven by shifts in aggregate demand. The same idea is corroborated by recent work that exploits the regional variation in business cycles, such as Mian and Suf (2014) and Beraja, Hurst, and Ospina (2019). Low aggregate demand is also considered to be an important force behind the Great Recession and the slow recovery from it. (See, for instance, Hall, 2011; Eggertsson and Krugman, 2012; and Mian, Rao, and Sufi, 2013.)  \n\nThe particular way in which frms gain exposure to aggregate shocks in the model, namely through increasing labor leverage, has the empirical advantage of being more directly observable when in general, risk-taking by firms is notoriously difficult to identify and may only be indirectly inferred from the variability of profit measures. Moreover, as we discuss below, the literature has identified labor leverage as a first-order determinant of firm risk. The starting points are two simple observations (see the discussion in Danthine and Donaldson, 2002): (i) labor costs are typically the main component of frms’ cost structures; and (i) labor costs are in large part fixed costs and consequently tend to vary less than income. For example, Donangelo, Gourio, Kehrig, and Palacios (2019) show that on average, a 1% reduction in sales leads to a 0.99% reduction in non-labor costs, but only to a 0.69% reduction in labor costs. Our model captures these two features by focusing on labor as a production factor and by assuming that firms’ organizational and technological choices generate costs that cannot be readily adjusted to demand shocks. At the same time, it is important for our results that labor leverage be a decision variable that can be calibrated in the long run. Holzhacker, Krishnan, and Mahlendorf (2015) and Aboody, Levi, and Weiss (2018) provide empirical evidence consistent with managers having the ability to rebalance operating leverage in response to changes in the regulatory environment. Merz and Yashiv (2007) present a structural model in which frms’ decisions to adjust their labor force are subject to a convex adjustment cost. Consistent with our setup, in their model, labor cost structures are both rigid in the short term and structural decision variables in the long term. Merz and Yashiv (2007) show that this framework helps to explain the volatility of firm values.  \n\nThe link between labor leverage and firm risk is an empirically well-documented relation that provides support for the transmission channel of the aggregate shock in our model. Beyond the previously discussed papers Danthine and Donaldson (2002) and Merz and Yashiv (2007), a growing literature in asset pricing and macro-finance seeks to explain asset prices through the magnifying impact of labor leverage. Donangelo, Gourio, Kehrig, and Palacios (2019) show that firms with higher labor leverage are more sensitive to aggregate shocks, and therefore have stocks with higher expected return. In fact, they argue that half of the value premium can be explained through labor leverage. While we do not model capital structure, the risk induced by labor leverage should be embedded into any claim that is junior to labor obligations, which includes not only equity, but also debt. Consistent with this idea, Faviloukis, Lin, and Zhao (2020) show that labor leverage forecasts credit spreads as well as credit risk in the cross-section of firms. The literature has also used structural breaks to assess the causal relation between labor leverage and firm risk. For instance, Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin (2015) find that frms tend to reduce financial leverage when employment protection rises; and Serfing (2016) finds that labor protection laws that make workers more costly to dismiss cause frms operating profts to be more volatile. Overall, there is consistent and widespread evidence of the importance of labor leverage for firm risk. This evidence lends support to the mechanism at play in our model and suggests that distortions to labor leverage are likely to have a material impact on output and, ultimately, welfare.  \n\nIn the paper, the distortion of operating leverage from a constrained optimum is tied to the possibility of coordination failures across firms. On the positive side, this leads to novel predictions. First, operating leverage is higher when demand spillovers are more important. In the model, the monitoring cost $\\beta$ and the compensation associated with it calibrates the magnitude of demand spillovers when monopolies start producing, and operating leverage is increasing in $\\beta$ . Identifying these spillovers is then a key empirical challenge. One possibility is to exploit firms’ geographical locations. For instance, Dougal, Parsons, and Titman (2014) show that firms′ investments are sensitive to investment by frms located in the same area even if those firms are in different industries. They argue this is suggestive of spillovers that could be rooted in consumption externalities between residents, like those at play in our model. Therefore, variations in geographical location could be used to proxy for the intensity of these spillover effects, with the caveat that location is in part endogenous. (See also Tuzel and Zhang, 2017.) Second, the effect of operating leverage is particularly pervasive when coordination failures are more likely to arise. Testing this prediction requires measures of firms’ ability to coordinate production and investment. For instance, common ownership can serve as a coordination device by inducing shareholders to internalize the demand externality. Weinstein and Yafeh (1995) show that Japanese firms that belong to a Keiretsu behave differently from those that do not. Their results suggest that the pattern of cross-ownership that characterizes these large multiindustry corporate groups induce them to produce at a higher level than those maximizing individual frms profits, consistent with coordination motives. Recent studies on common ownership (e.g., Azar, Schmalz, and Tecu, 2018) argue that large institutional investors play a coordinating role within and across industries. Interestingly, this literature also identifies plausibly exogenous shocks to common ownership -mergers between asset managers- that could help with identification. Finally, government intervention and a strong public sector can also have a role in preventing economic crises by reducing the likelihood of a coordination failure. For instance, a countercyclical public policy of stimulating the economy in the low productivity states can have a stabilizing effect by means of coordinating production. The role of public policy is explored in detail in Section 4 below. On the normative side, our model predicts that in the presence of demand externalities, operating leverage is inefficiently high in that expected output is too low. The model also predicts that this depressed output is related to an excessive exposure of the economy to recession risk. Taking this prediction to the data would likely require a structural approach, where one could run counterfactuals and obtain an estimate of the output loss. One step in that direction are quantitative models of business cycles that embed coordination problems such as Schaal and Taschereau-Dumouchel (2018, 2019). These models can quantitatively account for the slow recovery that follows large aggregate shocks as agents coordinate on inefficient low-output equilibria. Incorporating a labor leverage decision would be the next step. Nonetheless, there is evidence supporting the idea that volatility is harmful in terms of economic growth, particularly in developing economies. For instance, Hnatkovska and Loayza (2005) show that the volatility due to crises has outsized effects on the growth of developing countries relative to the volatility due to normal fuctuations. More generally, the relation between recession risk and growth is consistent with a stream of papers initiated by the finding in Ramey and Ramey (1995) that output volatility and output growth are negatively correlated.  \n\n## 4. Public policy  \n\nThis section analyzes the role of public policy: how government intervention at the production stage feeds back into firms’ production and operating leverage decisions. Specifically, we assume the government can intervene at $t=1$ to coordinate production among an $m$ mass of monopolists where $m\\in[0,1)$ . The rest of the monopolists, of mass $(1-m)$ ,are as in the baseline model. The $m$ -mass of monopolists differ from the other $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists in the economy in two ways. First, the $m$ -mass of monopolists can share their private signals $\\boldsymbol{l}_{q}=\\boldsymbol{L}+\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{q}$ with the government which, therefore, learns $L$ perfectly. Second, the government can commit to having the $m$ -mass of monopolists produce in a given set of states -realizations of $L-$ even if producing in some of these states yields negative profits. In that case, the government could finance these losses through a lump-sum tax.  \n\nNatural interpretations of the $m$ -mass of monopolists are the size of the public sector, the number of government-controlled firms, or the number of sectors in which the government has the capacity to infuence production decisions, possibly through subsidies or investment tax credits. Note that this extension nests the baseline model, which corresponds to the case with $m=0$ . As in the baseline model, we use global games techniques to pin down the production strategy of the $m$ -mass of monopolists not controlled by the government, and we focus on the case in which the noise in the private signals about $L$ vanishes: $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ The following proposition characterizes the resulting equilibrium of the production game at $t=1$  \n\nProposition 5. Suppose all monopolists choose operating leverage $s$ at $t=0$ . There ecists a government strategy such that when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ , all monopolists produce if  \n\n$$\nL\\geq\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s}+\\frac{\\beta(1-m)F(s)}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-m(1-\\alpha+s)}{\\alpha-s}\\right)}\\equiv L^{T}(s,m),\n$$  \n\nand no monopolist produces if $L<L^{T}(s,m)$ . The threshold $L^{T}(s,m)$ is strictly decreasing in m from $L^{T}(s,0)=L^{T}(s)$ , the production threshold in the baseline model in Eq. (13), to LT(s, 1) = (-β)F(, , the Pareto-optimal production threshold.  \n\nThe main insight of Proposition 5 is that government control over the production of a fraction $m$ of monopolists alleviates the coordination problem at $t=1$ for all monopolists. Indeed, the government's commitment to have an $m$ -mass of monopolists produce for $L\\geq L^{T}(s,m)$ creates a positive demand externality on the other $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists, which induces them to produce as well. Specifically, for $L\\in[L^{T}(s,m),L^{T}(s,0))$ , the government's commitment shifts the economy from an equilibrium in which no monopolist produces to a Pareto-improving equilibrium in which all monopolists produce and are making strictly positive profits.  \n\nProposition 5 also shows that if $m<1$ , the government's strategy alleviates the coordination problem but does not eliminate it completely: for (F,LT(s, m)) monopolists are still not producing, which is Pareto-dominated by all monopolists producing. However, the equilibrium in Proposition 5 is the best government can do at $t=1$ to coordinate production. Corollary 1. Suppose all monopolists choose operating leverage s at $t=0$ .When $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ ， monopolists producing if and only if $L\\geq L^{T}(s,m)$ is constrained effcient at $t=1$  \n\nIntuitively, while the government can coordinate production among an $m$ -mass of monopolists, the other $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists still face a coordination problem. Because of this coordination problem, the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists do not produce below $L^{T}(s,m)$ , even if they expect the $m$ -mass of government-controlled monopolists to produce. Then, given that the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists never produce below $L^{T}(s,m)$ , it is Pareto-optimal for the government to have the $m$ -mass of monopolists also abstain from producing below $L^{T}(s,m)$ : their producing in that region would generate losses that decrease welfare with no effect on the behavior of the other $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists. Note finally that in this constrained optimum, no monopolist ever makes losses when it operates, including the $m$ -mass controlled by the government, and hence no taxation is required in equilibrium. In that sense, while the government's commitment to production by the $m$ -mass of monopolists is useful in shifting the behavior of the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists, it does not generate costs for the former monopolists or the government.  \n\nWe now turn to the choice of operating leverage at $t=0$ . Monopolists choose their operating leverage to maximize expected profits. Since all monopolists produce if and only if $L\\ge$ $L^{T}(s,m)$ at $t=1$ , they all face the same optimization problem at $t=0$ , which is equivalent to the one in Eq. (17) except for the fact that now $\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})$ depends on threshold $L^{T}(s,m)$ The following proposition characterizes the equilibrium operating leverage at $t=0$  \n\nProposition 6. There is a unique equilibrium operating leverage $s^{*}(m)$ which is the solution to  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[y|L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*}(m),m)\\right]-F^{\\prime}(s^{*}(m))=0.\n$$  \n\nThis equilibrium $s^{*}(m)$ is strictly decreasing in $m$  \n\nProposition 6 is equivalent to Proposition 2 in the main model and has the same interpretation. More specifically, similar to condition in Eq. (18), condition in Eq. (22) states that there are no marginal gains in terms of profits along that intensive margin when monopolist $q$ chooses $s^{*}(m)$ and produces for $L$ above $L^{T}(s^{*}(m),m)$ . Proposition 6, however, has the additional implication that $s^{*}(m)$ is decreasing in $m$ . Therefore, the government's commitment to inducing production above $L^{T}(s,m)$ at $t=1$ has two effects: (i) improving coordination at $t=1$ for a given operating leverage $s$ (i.e., from Proposition 5, $L^{T}(s,m)<L^{T}(s,0)$ for $m>0$ ); and (i) reducing operating leverage at $t=0$ (i.e., Proposition 6, $s^{*}(m)<s^{*}(0)$ for $m>0$ ). As we show next, these two effects increase welfare.  \n\nSince maximizing welfare is akin to maximizing corporate profits (see Eq. (19), let $W(s,m)$ be the welfare function for an economy with operating leverage $s$ andan $m$ -massof  \n\ngovernment-controlled monopolists:  \n\n$$\nW(s,m)\\equiv\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L^{T}(s,m),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L-F(s)}{\\alpha-s}-F(s)d L.\n$$  \n\nProposition 7 below shows that welfare increases in $m$  \n\nProposition 7. $W(s^{*}(m),m)$ is strictly increasing in m. When $m\\to1$ , operating leverage and production decisions tend to the first-best optimal.  \n\nThe intuition for Proposition 7 is directly related to the two above-mentioned effects. First, the government's intervention prevents coordination failures in production at $t~=~1$ for a given $s$ (i.e., oW(sm) > 0).  Second, the government's intervention that mitigates the coordination problem at $t=1$ has the additional benefit of curbing excessive operating leverage at $t=0$ (i.e, $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\partial W(s,m)}{\\partial s}\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial m}>0.}\\end{array}$ ). Therefore, a government that can credibly commit to stimulating the economy in low productivity states has a stabilizing effect by both avoiding abrupt transitions between high- and low-production regimes ex post and inducing lower leverage ex ante. Importantly, government intervention at $t=1$ can only be fully effective if it is anticipated at $t=0$ and, therefore, if it has the effect of reducing the equilibrium operating leverage at $t=0$ . In other words, a lack of credibility to intervene in the future generates excess operating leverage ex ante, which in turn, magnifies the need for government intervention ex post. Note also that Proposition 7 is a statement on expected profits, but the increase in welfare compounds differential effects across states: there is a decrease in downside risk at the cost of a worse economic performance in high productivity states.  \n\nOverall, our results indicate that public policy can be an efficient instrument to curb risktaking and prevent crises. Rodrik (1998） provides evidence consistent with the idea that government spending plays a risk-reducing role in economies exposed to a significant amount of external risk.  \n\nFinally, note that we have allowed for the government to intervene at $t=1$ to coordinate production but not at $t=0$ to lower operating leverage. (The lower operating leverage at $t=0$ when goverment can coordinate production among an $m$ -mass of monopolists at $t=1$ , i.e., $s^{*}(m)<s^{*}(0)$ , is the byproduct of monopolists anticipating a lower production threshold at $t=1$ ) In doing so, this section highlights the stabilizing effect that a policy of stimulating the economy in low-productivity states has by means of coordinating production. Naturally, however, the excessive leverage result we focus on in the baseline model generalizes to this extension: lowering all monopolists’ operating leverage from the equilibrium level in Proposition 7 can also raise welfare. This suggests that another lever for government intervention would be to directly induce the $m$ -mass of monopolists to lower their operating leverage to below the equilibrium level in Proposition 7.  \n\n## 5. Discussion  \n\n### 5.1. Sources of coordination failure  \n\nAs previously discussed, the role of the monitoring friction is to generate equilibrium multiplicity and the possibility of a coordination failure at the production stage. Our assumption is isomorphic to one in Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989) but it also lends itself to a natural extension in which workers perceive a rent.6 Suppose that when supervisors do not exert effort, there is now a small but strictly positive probability $p$ that the product is functional. In that case, if supervisors are protected by limited liability, incentivizing monitoring requires leaving each supervisor with a pay equal to $\\beta/(1-p)>\\beta$ per unit, which is strictly higher than the supervisor's monitoring cost. The severity of the moral hazard friction (i.e., the magnitude of this rent) aggravates equilibrium inefficiencies through two channels. First, a higher rent makes monopolists more likely to coordinate on the non-productive equilibrium at $t=1$ . This is because monopolists internalize the rent as a real cost, while it merely is a redistribution of surplus from shareholders to workers. The higher incidence of coordination failures at $t=1$ lowers consumers’ expected utility, keeping operating leverage constant. Second, the incremental production inefficiency at $t=1$ induces monopolists to increase their operating leverage at $t=0$ . Intuitively, more frequent coordination failures make all monopolists less likely to survive a bad shock, which increases the weight of high-productivity states in each monopolist's leverage optimization problem. As a result equilibrium operating leverage moves further away from the social optimum, amplifying the ex post production inefficiency and depressing welfare. The following proposition formalizes this discussion.  \n\nProposition 8. In any symmetric equilibrium, there is excessive operating leverage, and an increase in p increases operating leverage and decreases welfare.  \n\nProposition 8 establishes that rents increase operating leverage and decrease welfare by creating a misalignment between firms’ objective functions and consumers’ welfare. Note that this misalignment aggravates the inefficiency in risk-taking but is not necessary to generate it. As Proposition 3 shows, even when rents are absent ( $p=0$ )and maximizing aggregate corporate profits coincide with maximizing consumers′ welfare (see Eq. (19)), the coordination problem between firms persists, which makes production and operating leverage decisions suboptimal.  \n\nFinally, Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989) provide other mechanisms beyond moral hazard that lead to equilibrium multiplicity in the presence of demand externalities, for instance, when firms invest to generate future labor savings. Therefore, while our modelling choice is both technically convenient as well economically relevant -information frictions are pervasive in large organizations-, it is not the only way to generate a coordination failure in the context of the modelled economy. Moreover, as emphasized by Proposition 4, the excessive operating leverage at $t=0$ is caused by the coordination failure at $t=1$ in itself, rather than by the specific origin of the coordination failure.  \n\n### 5.2. State-dependent multiplier  \n\nIn our model, the inefficiency operates through the impact that monopolists leverage decisions have on the probability of a coordination failure, that is, it operates through the extensive margin. However, monopolists’ leverage decisions also affect each other's profitability in every state $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ in which they produce, that is, it affects the intensive margin. So far, the incentives of monopolists and the social planner have been aligned along the intensive margin because the demand multiplier has been constant across all states in which monopolists produce. (See Eq. (20) and the discussion that follws.) Shleifer and Vishny (1988) show that a misalignment of public and private incentives to produce can arise along the intensive margin if the demand multiplier is not constant across states. By shutting down this channel, our model is designed to isolate the effect of ex post coordination failures on ex ante risk-taking (Proposition 3). We explore next how a misalignment along the intensive margin would affect operating leverage decisions.  \n\nAs will become clear below, one way to endogenously make the demand multiplier statecontingent is to introduce heterogeneity among monopolists.7 Specifically, we assume that all monopolists have the same fixed cost, $\\textstyle F(s_{q})={\\frac{s_{q}}{\\alpha-s_{q}}}$ , but a proportion $n_{i}$ of monopolists have marginal cost $\\alpha+\\Delta_{i}-s_{q}$ , where $i=1,2$ ， $n_{i}+n_{j}=1$ ， $\\alpha+\\Delta_{i}<1$ , and $\\Delta_{1}\\neq\\Delta_{2}$ . To isolate the effect of heterogeneity on operating leverage decisions, we rule out coordination failures at the production stage by assuming that $\\beta=0$ . The next proposition characterizes the efficiency of the equilibrium operating leverage at $t=0$  \n\nProposition 9. Any symmetric equilibrium in which type- $i$ monopolistschoose $s_{i}^{*}$ isconstrained inefficient: the equilibrium features insufcient operating leverage in that increasing  \n\nTo understand the intuition behind Proposition 9, note first that, since there are no coordination failures at $t=1$ （ $\\beta=0$ ), production is ex post efficient. As a result, monopolists' and social planer's incentives to take on operating leverage are aligned along the extensive margin. However, private and public incentives no longer align along the intensive margin. While in the main model all monopolists have the same operating threshold, here, the production threshold depends on the monopolist's type. Assume without loss of generality that type $i$ monopolists have a lower production threshold $L_{i}^{T}$ than type $j$ monopolists $L_{j}^{T}$ , that is, for $L\\in[L_{i}^{T},L_{j}^{T})$ only type $i$ monopolists operate while for $L\\in[L_{j}^{T},\\overline{{L}}]$ both types operate. This implies that the demand multiplier is no longer constant across states in which a monopolist is active: it is equal to $(1-n_{i}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{i}+s_{i}^{*}))^{-1}$ for $L\\in[L_{i}^{T},L_{j}^{T})$ and $(1-n_{i}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{i}+s_{i}^{*})-n_{j}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{j}+s_{j}^{*}))^{-1}$ for $L\\in[L_{j}^{\\prime},L]$ . Since $(1-n_{i}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{i}+s_{i}^{*})-n_{j}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{j}+s_{j}^{*}))^{-1}>(1-n_{i}(1-\\alpha-\\Delta_{i}+s_{i}^{*}))^{-1},$ a marginal unit of profit has a higher welfare impact when $L\\in[L_{j}^{T},\\overline{{L}}]$ than when $L\\in[L_{i}^{T},L_{j}^{T})$ . As a result, maximizing expected profit is no longer equivalent to maximizing expected welfare. Relative to a monopolist, a social planner has a higher willingness to shift profits from $[L_{i}^{T},L_{j}^{T})$ to $[L_{j}^{T},\\overline{{L}}]$ because the welfare impact per unit of profit is higher in $[L_{j}^{I},L]$ than in $[L_{i}^{T},L_{j}^{T})$ Thic ic ovactly what highor onoratino lovoravo achiovee 8  \n\nOverall, contrasting the insuffcient leverage result in Proposition 9 with our main result of excessive leverage in Proposition 3 stresses that coordination failures have a distinct directional effect on ex ante risk-taking decisions. While the analysis in the current section suggests that risk-taking decisions can be distorted in more than one way, the importance of the excessive leverage result of Proposition 3 is commensurate to the role that coordination failures play in explaining crises and recessions, as discussed at the end of Section 3. In that sense, the inefficiencies in Proposition 3 and Proposition 9 speak to different concerns about the distribution of output across states of the economy. In Proposition 9, insuffcient leverage prevents the economy from fully exploiting demand spillovers after a positive productivity shock, while in Proposition 3, excessive leverage makes the economy too exposed to a negative productivity shock. To the extent that recessions and crises infict material and long-lasting damages, that second channel ought to be of particular significance.  \n\n### 5.3. Operating leverage specification  \n\nIn the paper, frms decide their cost structure by trading off higher fixed labor costs for lower variable costs. Specifically, monopolist $q$ incurs a fixed cost of $\\begin{array}{r}{F(s_{q})=\\frac{s_{q}}{\\alpha-s_{q}}}\\end{array}$ units of labor and a constant marginal cost of $\\alpha-s_{q}$ units of labor per unit of output, where $s_{q}\\in[0,\\alpha]$ is choice variable that captures operating leverage. The function $F(s_{q})$ is increasing, convex, and tends to infinity as $s_{q}\\to\\alpha$ , which guarantees that the equilibrium operating leverage $s^{*}$ is smaller than $\\alpha$ (and hence, that variable costs are positive).  \n\nBecause the monopolist's optimization problem with respect to $s_{q}$ in Eq. (17) is not convex, local optimality conditions are not sufficient for global optimality, and large deviations also need to be ruled out. The function we chose for $F(s_{q})$ ， $\\frac{s_{q}}{\\alpha-s_{q}}$ provides the necessary analytical tractability for studying large deviations to determine existence. (See the proof of Proposition 2 in the Appendix.) However, the local necessary condition that characterizes the equilibrium in Proposition 2 holds for a generic increasing and convex function. Moreover, around this local equilibrium condition, there is excessive operating leverage, as in Proposition 3. The logic is also identical to the one previously discussed for Proposition 3: at the equilibrium leverage $s^{*}$ , a marginal decrease in the leverage of all monopolists lead them to switch from iactivity to production just below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ (ie, LT(s > 0), which improves welfare. This highlights once again that the excessive leverage result is driven by the monopolists’ failure to coordinate production below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ at $t=1$ , and not by the chosen functional form for the fixed cost. The following proposition formalizes this discussion.  \n\nProposition 1o. Consider a generic increasing and convex function $F(.)$ ,any symmetric interior equilibrium $s^{*}$ at $t~=~1$ satisfies condition in Eq. (18) in Proposition $\\mathcal{L}$ ,and a collective marginal decrease in operating leverage around $s^{*}$ increases welfare.  \n\n## 6. Conclusion  \n\nCoordination failures are often invoked to explain periods of recession and crises in which economies appear to be trapped in down-cycles of low output, trading, and investment. In essence, the literature views economies as interdependent systems in which agents need to coordinate their investment and consumption decisions. We show that these economies leature excessive operatig ieverage ds lrnis uo not iternaize tie enect tnat tnelr lisK choices have on the probability of the economy suffering a coordination failure. The excessive operating leverage increases downside risk and causes expected output to be lower than in the social optimum. The loss in expected output compounds differential effects across states: There is a shift in output towards high-productivity states that comes at the cost of more frequent and severe economic crises. The analysis has implications for public policy: a countercyclical policy that stimulates the economy in low productivity states has a stabilizing effect by both, avoiding coordination failures ex post and curving excessive risk ex ante. While our model emphasizes the role of demand externalities because of its economic importance, strategic complementarities across economic agents have been shown to arise through a broad variety of channels (e.g., thick market externalities, technological complementarities, and imperfect information). These other sources of strategic complementarities can also generate multiple equilibria and create scope for coordination failures. In general, we expect the same economic forces to apply in setups with these alternative sources. Indeed, as long as risk increases the probability of a coordination failure and agents do not internalize this effect, agents will tend to engage in excessive risk-taking. Strategic complementarities are notably important in the financial system as ilustrated by recurrent financial crises. Specifically, the liquidity transformation role of financial institutions combined with the fact that these institutions form a highly interconnected network makes financial systems particularly vulnerable to coordination failures. Our analysis suggests that a concentrated financial system is more stable in that financial institutions internalize, to a larger extent, the effect that their risk choices have on the probability of a systemic financial crisis. Alternatively, it also suggests that a more disperse financial system requires stricter regulation to curve excessive risk-taking. The analysis of these effects in the specific context of an economy with a financial system is an interesting avenue for future research.  \n\n# References  \n\nAboody, D., Levi, S., Weiss, G., 2018.

For most of our results, this assumption boils downto $\\overline{{L}}>2$  \n\n## Proof of Proposition 1  \n\nSuppose all firms choose $s$ , and firm $q$ observes a noisy signal of $L$ : a signal $\\boldsymbol{l}_{q}=\\boldsymbol{L}+\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{q}$ where $\\xi_{q}$ is uniform on $[-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon]$ . Suppose firm $q$ produces iff ${\\mathit{l}}_{q}>{\\mathit{l}}^{*}$ . Then, for a given realization of $L$ , the number of frms that produce is  \n\n$$\nn(L)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{1}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L>l^{*}+\\varepsilon}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\underbrace{L+\\varepsilon-l^{*}}_{2\\varepsilon}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L\\in[l^{*}-\\varepsilon,l^{*}+\\varepsilon]}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{0}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L<l^{*}-\\varepsilon}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe firm with signal $l^{*}$ must be indifferent:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}\\int_{l^{*}-\\varepsilon}^{l^{*}+\\varepsilon}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L-n(L)F}{1-n(L)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F d L=0.\n$$  \n\nConsider the follwing change of variable: $\\begin{array}{r}{z=\\frac{L+\\varepsilon-l^{*}}{2\\varepsilon}\\Leftrightarrow L=2\\varepsilon z+l^{*}-\\varepsilon}\\end{array}$ Eq. (A.2) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}\\int_{0}^{1}\\left\\{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{2\\varepsilon z+l^{\\ast}-\\varepsilon-n(2\\varepsilon z+l^{\\ast}-\\varepsilon)F}{1-n(2\\varepsilon z+l^{\\ast}-\\varepsilon)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F\\right\\}2\\varepsilon d z=0}\\ &{\\displaystyle\\Leftrightarrow\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{2\\varepsilon z+l^{\\ast}-\\varepsilon-z F}{1-z(1-\\alpha+s)}-F d z=0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTaking the limit when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ and defining $L^{T}(s)$ as the limit of $l^{*}$ when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ ,Eq. (A.4) writes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L^{T}(s)-z F}{1-z(1-\\alpha+s)}-F d z=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\frac{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}{1-\\alpha+s}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{(1-\\alpha+s)L^{T}(s)-z(1-\\alpha+s)F}{1-z(1-\\alpha+s)}d z-F=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\frac{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}{1-\\alpha+s}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{(1-\\alpha+s)L^{T}(s)-F}{1-z(1-\\alpha+s)}d z-\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\alpha+s}F=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow-\\frac{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}{(1-\\alpha+s)^{2}}\\left[(1-\\alpha+s)L^{T}(s)-F\\right]\\ln(\\alpha-s)-\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\alpha+s}I}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTherefore  \n\n$$\nL^{T}(s)={\\frac{F}{1-\\alpha+s}}+{\\frac{\\beta F}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\ln\\left({\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s}}\\right)}}.\n$$  \n\nIt is apparent that the RHS of Eq. (A.4) is increasing in $l^{*}$ , which guarantees the uniqueness of an equilibrium in threshold strategies for any $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ . Now, iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies ensure global uniqueness in a setting with global strategic complementarities (see, e.g., Morris and Shin, 2003). One potential concern here is that monopolists' actions are not complement if $L$ is small enough. Specifically, letting $n$ be the fraction of  \n\nmonopolists who produce,  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\partial\\pi}{\\partial n}}\\geq0\\Leftrightarrow L\\geq{\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s}}.\n$$  \n\nNote however, that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s}<\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s},\n$$  \n\ni.e., the region where the frms' actions are not strategic complement is strictly smaller than the upper bound of the lower-dominance region. Therefore if  \n\n$$\n2\\varepsilon<\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}-\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s},\n$$  \n\na private signal $l_{q}$ consistent with $\\begin{array}{r}{L\\ge\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ rules out L< 1-α+s Fs (ie., ensures that L is in the region where actions are complement). This, in turn, allows to apply the standard iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies. It follows that the threshold equilibrium derived in Eq. (A.4) is the unique equilibrium for $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ small enough, hence when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ $\\it Q.E.D$  \n\n## Proof of Proposition 2  \n\n### Part I. Proof of Proposition 2: Local Conditions.  \n\nSuppose monopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ and all other monopolists choose $s^{*}\\in(0,\\alpha)$  \n\n(a) If no other monopolist operate, monopolist $q$ operates if  \n\n$$\nL>L_{-}(s_{q})\\equiv\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}.\n$$  \n\nSince (i) $\\alpha+\\beta<1$ ， $L_{-}^{\\prime}(s_{q})>0$ ; (ii) $\\beta>0$ ， $L_{-}(s^{*})>L^{T}(s^{*})$ (from Eq. (A.9)); and (ii) $L_{-}(0)=0<L^{T}(s^{*})$ , there is a unique $s_{-}$ such that $L_{-}(s_{-})=L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{-}<s^{*}$ If $L<L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{q}<s_{-}$ ， $q$ operates iff $L>L_{-}(s_{q})$ .If $L<L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{q}>s_{-}$ ， $q$ never operates.  \n\n(b)  If all other monopolist operate, monopolist $q$ operates if  \n\n$$\nL>L_{+}(s_{q})\\equiv(\\alpha-s^{*})\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}+F(s^{*}),\n$$  \n\nSince (i) $L_{+}^{\\prime}(s_{q})>0$ ;(i) $\\beta>0$ ， $L_{+}(s^{*})<L^{T}(s^{*})$ (from Eq. (A.9)); and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to\\alpha}L_{+}(s)=}\\end{array}$ $+\\infty$ , there is a unique $s_{+}<\\alpha$ such that $L_{+}(s_{+})=L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{+}>s^{*}$ . If $L>L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{q}>s_{+}$ ， $q$ operates if $L>L_{+}(s_{q})$ . If $L>L^{T}(s^{*})$ and $s_{q}<s_{+}$ ， $q$ always operates.  \n\n(a) and (b) implies that  \n\n$$\nL\\geq\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{(\\alpha-s^{*})\\displaystyle\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}+F(s^{*})}&{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\geq s_{+},}\\ &{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\in(s^{*},s_{+}),}\\ {L^{T}(s^{*})}&{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\in(s^{*},s_{+}),}\\ {L^{T}(s^{*})}&{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\in(s_{-},s^{*}),}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}}&{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\leq s_{-}.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe monopolist optimization problem writes (see Eq. (17))  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{s_{q}}\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*}),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L)-F(s_{q})d L,\n$$  \n\nand therefore, since the optimal $s_{q}$ is such that $\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})<\\overline{{L}}$ , and since Eq. (A.15) implies that $\\begin{array}{r}{\\left|\\frac{\\partial\\hat{L}(s_{q},s^{*})}{\\partial s_{q}}\\right|_{s_{q}=s^{*}}=0}\\end{array}$ , the first-order condition for an interior solution to the monopolist optimization problem writes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{E\\left[y|L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\right]-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\left(\\frac{\\overline{{L}}+L^{T}(s^{*})}{2}-F(s^{*})\\right)\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F^{\\prime}(s^{*})=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\overline{{L}}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s^{*}}\\left[2(\\alpha+s^{*})-\\frac{s^{*}}{1-\\alpha+s^{*}}-\\frac{\\beta s^{*}}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*})\\ln{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s^{*}}\\right)}}\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIf $s^{*}=0$ , the RHS of Eq. (A.19)) is equal to 2. If $s^{*}\\to\\alpha$ , the RHS of Eq. (A.19) tends to $+\\infty$ . It follows that if $\\overline{{L}}>2$ , Eq. (A.19) has at least one solution. Rewrite, Eq. (A.19) as  \n\n$$\n\\alpha\\overline{{L}}=2\\alpha+s^{\\ast}\\underbrace{\\Bigg(2+\\overline{{L}}-\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha+s^{\\ast}}-\\frac{\\beta}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{\\ast})\\ln{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s^{\\ast}}\\right)}}\\Bigg)}_{\\equiv f(s^{\\ast})}\n$$  \n\nSince $f^{\\prime}(.)>0$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to\\alpha}f(s)=1+L>0}\\end{array}$ implies there exists $\\hat{s}$ (possibly equal to $0$ such that $f(s)>0$ if $s>\\hat{s}$ $L>2$ implies that at $s=0$ , the RHS is lower than $2\\alpha$ and therefore, $s\\in[0,\\hat{s})$ cannot be a solution to Eq. (A.20) since for $s\\in[0,\\hat{s})$ , the RHS is also lower than $2\\alpha$ . If $s>\\hat{s}$ , then $f(s)>0$ and $f^{\\prime}(s)>0$ imply that the RHS of Eq. (A.20) is strictly increasing. Therefore, Eq. (A.20) has a unique solution. Hence, if there exists a symmetric equilibrium, this equilibrium is unique, interior (i.e., $s^{*}\\in(0,\\alpha)$ ) and defined by the f.o.c. in Eq. (A.17).  \n\nThe frst-order condition in Eq. (A.17) gives a necessary condition for a symmetric equilibrium to exists as otherwise firm $q$ would have incentive to deviate locally from $s^{*}$ . Next we analyze the possibility of non-local deviations from $s^{*}$ by firm $q$  \n\n### Part II. Proof of Proposition 2: Large Deviations  \n\n\\*Consider frst a deviation to $s_{q}<s^{*}$  \n\nReminder: let $s_{-}\\in(0,s^{*}]$ be the unique solution to $L_{-}(s_{-})=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , where $L_{-}(.)$ is defined in Eq. (A.13). If $\\beta>0$ then $s_{-}<s^{*}$ , and  \n\n- if sq ≤s-, then q invests iff L≥ L-(s) = 1-a-8+sa\\* -if $s_{q}>s_{-}$ , then $q$ invests iff $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$  \n\nMonopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ to maximize profits  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\pi(s_{q})=\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})\\frac{L-F(s^{*})}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F(s_{q})~d L}\\ {\\displaystyle\\qquad+\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L_{-}(s_{q}),L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}^{L^{T}(s^{*})}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})L-F(s_{q})~d L.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe first derivative with respect to $s_{q}$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\pi(s_{q})}{\\partial s_{q}}=\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{L-F(s^{*})}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F^{\\prime}(s_{q})d L+\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L-(s_{q}),L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}^{L^{T}(s^{*})}L-F^{\\prime}(s_{q})d L.\n$$  \n\nTwo observations:  \n\n1. If $s_{q}\\in[s_{-},s^{*})$ ， $\\pi^{\\prime}(s_{q})$ simplifies to  \n\n$$\n\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{L-F(s^{*})}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F^{\\prime}(s_{q})d L>0\n$$  \n\nsince $F^{\\prime\\prime}>0$ . Therefore, monopolist $q$ does not deviate an $s_{q}\\in[s_{-},s^{*})$  \n\n2. $\\pi^{\\prime}(.)$ is continuous (though not differentiable at $s_{-}$ ), which implies that when $s_{q}\\to s_{-}$ from below, $\\pi^{\\prime}(s_{q})>0$  \n\nSuppose now $s_{q}<s_{-}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})=-\\displaystyle\\int_{L_{-}(s_{q})}^{\\overline{{L}}}F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})~d L-\\left[L_{-}(s_{q})-F^{\\prime}(s_{q})\\right]L_{-}^{\\prime}(s_{q})}}\\ {{=\\displaystyle-[\\overline{{L}}-L_{-}(s_{q})]F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})+\\displaystyle\\frac{[F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})]^{2}}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere we are using (and will use repeatedly) that  \n\n$$\nL_{-}^{\\prime}(s_{q})=\\frac{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-F(s_{q})}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})^{2}}=\\frac{F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}.\n$$  \n\nNext, we calculate the sign of the second derivative $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s)$ in Eq. (A.25). Since $F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})>0$ ， $\\operatorname{sign}(\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})){=}\\operatorname{sign}(\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})/F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q}))$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})}{F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})}=-\\overline{{L}}+\\underbrace{L_{-}(s_{q})+\\frac{[F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})]^{2}}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})}}_{\\equiv G(s_{q})}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{G^{\\prime}(s_{q})=\\frac{F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\frac{2[F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})][F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}^{\\prime}(s_{q})](1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})}{[F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})]^{2}}}\\ &{\\qquad-\\frac{[F^{\\prime}(s_{q})-L_{-}(s_{q})]^{2}[F^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})+F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})]}{[F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{q})(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})]^{2}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince $F^{\\prime}(s_{q})>L_{-}(s_{q})$ ， $G^{\\prime}(s_{q})$ has the sign of  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{|F^{\\prime}(s_{k})|^{1}:=-\\Delta^{\\prime}+s_{k}|}\\ &{+2|F^{\\prime}(s_{k})|^{2}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta\\right)(1-\\alpha-\\beta)+s_{k}|^{F^{\\prime}}(s_{k})}\\ &{-\\left(F^{\\prime}(s_{k})-L_{-}(s_{k})\\right)|(F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|(1-\\alpha+s_{k})+F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|}\\ &{-|F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|^{2}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta\\right)+s_{k}|^{F^{\\prime\\prime}}(s_{k})-L_{-}(s_{k})|F^{\\prime}(s_{k})|}\\ &{-3|F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|^{2}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)-2|F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})-L_{-}(s_{k})|^{F^{\\prime}}(s_{k})}\\ &{-\\left(F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})-L_{-}(s_{k})\\right)|(F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k})+F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|}\\ &{-3|F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|^{2}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)}\\ &{-\\left(F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})-L_{-}(s_{k})\\right)|F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)+3F^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{k})|}\\ &{-\\frac{12\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{3}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)-\\frac{6\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{2}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)}\\ &{+\\frac{6\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{3}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)-\\frac{6\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{3}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{k}\\right)}\\ &{+\\frac{6\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{4}}\\frac{1}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^{3}}-\\frac{6\\alpha^{2}}{(\\alpha-s_{k})^\n$$  \n\nwhich, in turn has the sign of  \n\n$$\ng(s_{q})\\equiv\\alpha(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})^{2}-(1-\\alpha-\\beta)(\\alpha-s_{q})^{2}\n$$  \n\nThere are two possible cases:  \n\n(I) $2\\alpha+\\beta-1\\le0$  \n\nThen $g(.)$ is concave, $g(\\alpha)>0$ and $g(0)\\geq0$ , therefore, $g(.)>0$ for $s_{q}\\in(0,s_{-})$ . It follows that $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}$ is increasing for $s_{q}=0$ and is strictly increasing for $s\\in(0,s_{-})$  \n\n(I1) $2\\alpha+\\beta-1>0$ Then $g(.)$ is convex, $g(\\alpha)>0$ and $g(0)<0$ . It follows that $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(.)$ is first decreasing, then increasing on $[0,\\alpha)$  \n\nN.B.: $\\pi^{\\prime}(0)>0$ and $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{-})<0$ is then sufficient to rule out the deviation. Indeed, in (I), $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{-})<0$ and $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}$ increasing imply $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(.)<0$ on $[0,s_{-})$ . Then since $\\pi^{\\prime}(s_{-})>$ 0, $\\pi^{\\prime}(.)>0$ on $[0,s_{-})$ In (II), $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(s_{-})<0$ implies either $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(.)<0$ on $[0,s_{-})$ (then back to previous case), or $\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}(.)$ is first positive and then negative.

In addition, if $\\overline{{L}}\\rightarrow+\\infty$ then $L^{T}(s^{*})\\to+\\infty$ which implies ${\\cal L}_{-}(s_{-})~\\to~+\\infty$ , which implies $s_{-}\\to\\alpha$ .Finally, by definition, $L_{-}(s_{-})=L^{T}(s^{*})$  \n\n$$\nL_{-}(s_{-})(\\alpha-s^{*})=\\frac{s_{-}}{(\\alpha-s_{-})(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{-})}(\\alpha-s^{*})=L^{T}(s^{*})(\\alpha-s^{*})\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Leftrightarrow{\\frac{s_{-}}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{-}}}{\\overline{{L}}}(\\alpha-s^{*})=L^{T}(s^{*})(\\alpha-s^{*}){\\overline{{L}}}(\\alpha-s_{-})\n$$  \n\nUsing, $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\overline{{L}}\\rightarrow+\\infty}L^{T}(s^{*})(\\alpha-s^{*})=\\alpha}\\end{array}$ ， $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\overline{{L}}\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\overline{{L}}(\\alpha-s^{*})=3\\alpha}\\end{array}$ and $\\scriptstyle{\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\overline{{L}}\\to+\\infty}s_{-}=\\alpha}$ yields  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\overline{{{L}}}\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\overline{{{L}}}(\\alpha-s_{-})=\\frac{3\\alpha}{1-\\beta}\n$$  \n\nNext, from Eq.

D.  \n\nAssume that for any (common) leverage $s$ , monopolists coordinate on the Pareto-superior equilibrium in the production game, that is, from Eq. (9) monopolists produce at $t=1$ if and only if  \n\n$$\nL\\geq L^{+}(s)\\equiv(1-\\beta)\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}.\n$$  \n\nConsider a deviation by monopolist $q$ : monopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ when all other monopolists choose leverage $s$ . Monopolist $q$ produces if and only if  \n\n$$\nL\\geq L^{+}(s_{q},s)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\displaystyle{\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}},L^{+}(s)\\right\\}}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}<s}}\\ {{\\displaystyle(\\alpha-s)\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}}+F(s)}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\geq s}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe f.o.c. of $s_{q}$ when all other monopolists choose $s^{*}$ writes:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s_{q}}\\int_{L^{+}(s_{q},s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{L-F\\left(s^{*}\\right)}{\\alpha-s^{*}}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q})-F\\left(s_{q}\\right)d L\\bigg|_{s_{q}=s^{*}}=0.\n$$  \n\nSince ${\\cal L}^{+}(s,s)={\\cal L}^{+}(s)$ , and for any $s$ ，  \n\n$$\n\\frac{L^{+}(s)-F\\left(s\\right)}{\\alpha-s}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)-F\\left(s\\right)=0,\n$$  \n\na marginal change in $s_{q}$ around $s^{*}$ only affects the integral in Eq. (A.61) through its inte  \n\ngrand. Therefore, Eq. (A.61) writes:  \n\n$$\n\\int_{L^{+}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{L-F\\left(s^{*}\\right)}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)d L=0.\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Leftrightarrow\\left(\\frac{\\overline{{{L}}}+L^{+}(s^{*})}{2}-F(s^{*})\\right)\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s^{*}}-F^{\\prime}(s^{*})=0\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Leftrightarrow\\overline{{{L}}}=2(\\alpha-s^{*})F^{\\prime}(s^{*})+\\left(2-\\frac{1-\\beta}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*}}\\right)F(s^{*})\n$$  \n\nIf $s^{*}=0$ , the RHS of Eq. (A.65) is equal to 2. If $s^{*}\\to\\alpha$ , the RHS of Eq. (A.65) tends to $+\\infty$ . It follows that if $\\overline{{L}}>2$ , Eq. (A.65) has at least one solution. Rewrite Eq. (A.65) as  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{L}}\\alpha=2\\alpha+s^{\\ast}\\underbrace{\\left(\\overline{{L}}+2-\\frac{1-\\beta}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{\\ast}}\\right)}_{\\equiv h(s^{\\ast})}\n$$  \n\nSince $h^{\\prime}(.)>0$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow\\alpha}h(s)=\\overline{{L}}+1>0}\\end{array}$ , there exists $\\hat{s}$ (possibly equal to $0$ ） such that $h(s)>0$ iff $s>\\hat{s}$ $\\overline{{L}}>2$ implies that at $s=0$ , the RHS is lower than $2\\alpha$ and therefore, $s\\in[0,\\hat{s})$ cannot be a solution to Eq. (A.66) since for $s\\in[0,\\hat{s})$ , the RHS is also lower than $2\\alpha$ . If $s>\\hat{s}$ ,then $h(s)>0$ and $h^{\\prime}(s)>0$ imply that the RHS of Eq. (A.66) is strictly increasing. Therefore, Eq. (A.66) has a unique solution. Hence, if there exists a symmetric equilibrium, this equilibrium is unique, interior (i.e., $s^{*}\\in(0,\\alpha)$ ) and defined by the f.o.c. in Eq. (A.63).  \n\nAs explained in the main text, maximizing consumers′ expected utility amounts to maximizing their expected income from corporate profits. Therefore, the social planner's problem  \n\nmaximizes  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{max}_{s}\\frac{1}{\\overline{{L}}}\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L^{+}(s),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}y(s,L)(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)-F\\left(s\\right)d L,\n$$  \n\nwhere, as earlier, $\\begin{array}{r}{y(s,L)=\\frac{L-F(s)}{\\alpha-s}}\\end{array}$ . Since at the social optimum $s^{**}$ $L^{+}(s^{**})<\\overline{{L}}$ , and using Eq. (A.62) again, the f.o.c of the problem in Eq. (A.67) writes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\quad\\frac{1}{\\overline{{L}}}\\int_{L^{+}(s^{**})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{\\partial y(s^{**},L)}{\\partial s}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{**})+y(s^{**},L)-F^{\\prime}(s^{**})d L=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\int_{L^{+}(s^{**})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{**}\\right)+y(s^{**},L)}{\\left(\\alpha-s^{**}\\right)}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{**})+y(s^{**},L)-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{**}\\right)d L=0}\\ &{\\Leftrightarrow\\int_{L^{+}(s^{**})}^{\\overline{{L}}}y(s^{**},L)-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{**}\\right)d L=0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, Eq. (A.70) holds at $s^{**}=s^{*}$ (i.e., the equilibrium leverage satisfies the frst-order condition of the social planner). Notice also that (i) as $s\\rightarrow\\alpha$ then $L^{+}(s)\\to+\\infty$ and the objective function in Eq. $(\\mathrm{A.67}){\\rightarrow}0$ ; and (ii) if $\\overline{{L}}>2$ , the first derivative (see Eq. (A.70)) evaluated at $s^{**}=0$ is positive:  \n\n$$\ns i g n\\left\\{\\int_{L^{+}(0)}^{\\overline{{L}}}y(0,L)-F^{\\prime}\\left(0\\right)d L\\right\\}=s i g n\\left\\{\\int_{0}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\frac{L}{\\alpha}-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}d L\\right\\}=s i g n\\left\\{\\frac{\\overline{{L}}}{2}-1\\right\\}>0,\n$$  \n\nthen there is at interior optimum $s^{**}\\in(0,\\alpha)$ , which needs to satisfy f.o.c. in Eq. (A.70). Since Eq. (A.63) and Eq. (A.70) coincide, and since we showed above that there is a unique interior solution, $s^{*}$ , to Eq. (A.63), it follows that $s^{**}=s^{*}$ . In words, if there is a symmetric equilibrium, it is unique and maximizes welfare. $\\it Q.E.D$  \n\n## Proof of Proposition 5  \n\nConsider first the case where the government commits to have the $m$ -mass of monopolists produce for $\\begin{array}{r}{L\\ge\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ @Fs , that is, whenever it is Pareto-optimal for all monopolists to produce. (It would never be optimal to commit to produce below $\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}$ as in such case, the $m$ -mass of monopolists would exert a negative demand externality on the rest of the economy: when $\\begin{array}{r}{L<\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ monopolists would be making a loss with probability one.) Turn to the other $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolist. As in Proposition 1, assume that monopolist $q$ produces if and only if ${\\mathit{l}}_{q}>{\\mathit{l}}^{*}$ . Then for a given $L$ and for $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ small enough, the mass of active monopolists is  \n\n$$\nn(L)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{1}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L>l^{*}+\\varepsilon}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{m+(1-m)\\frac{L+\\varepsilon-l^{*}}{2\\varepsilon}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L\\in[l^{*}-\\varepsilon,l^{*}+\\varepsilon]}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{0}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}L<l^{*}-\\varepsilon}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nA monopolist with signal $l^{*}$ must be indifferent between producing and not producing:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon}\\int_{l^{*}-\\varepsilon}^{l^{*}+\\varepsilon}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L-n(L)F}{1-n(L)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F d L=0.\n$$  \n\nEq. (A.73) implicitly defines a unique $l^{*}(\\varepsilon)$ , which is strictly greater than (1-β)F( for m E $[0,1)$ .(For $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ small enough, $l^{*}(\\varepsilon)-\\varepsilon$ is also strictly greater than (-β)F( ) Note that under the government's proposed strategy (i.e., to coordinate production among the $m$ -mass of $\\begin{array}{r}{L\\ge\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s})}\\end{array}$ $L$ close enough to $\\textstyle{\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}$ from above:in the aseaneof positivedemand exteralitis from the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists, production by the $m$ -mass of monopolists for $L$ close to $\\textstyle{\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}$ carries a loss. To mitigate this problem, suppose that instead of producing for $\\begin{array}{r}{L\\ge\\frac{(1-\\beta)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta+s}}\\end{array}$ government commits to produce for $L\\geq l^{\\ast}(\\varepsilon)-\\varepsilon$ where $l^{*}(\\varepsilon)$ is still defined by Eq. (A.73). Note that investing if and only if ${\\mathit{l}}_{q}>{\\mathit{l}}^{*}(\\varepsilon)$ still is the unique equilibrium of the production game among the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists. Next we characterized $l^{*}(\\varepsilon)$ as $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ . Start from Eq. (A.73) and consider the following change of variable: :L+e-\\*  L = 2ez+l\\*-. Eq.

Q.E.D.  \n\n## Proof of Corollary 1  \n\nRecall that the production threshold $L^{T}(s,m)$ of the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists is derived in the proof of Proposition 5 from the limit when $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ of the indifference condition in Eq. (A.73). That indifference condition states that the marginal independent monopolist should be indifferent between producing and not producing given the strategy of the other independent monopolists (mass $1-m$ ) and assuming that all government-controlled monopolist (mass $m$ ) produce. It follows that $L^{T}(s,m)$ is the smallest realization of $L$ above which the $(1-m)$ -mass of monopolists produce for any strategy followed by the $m$ -mass of monopolists.  \n\nConsider next the condition that implicitly defines $L^{T}(s,m)$ in Eq. (A.79):  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s)\\frac{L^{T}(s,m)-(m+(1-m)z)F}{1-(m+(1-m)z)(1-\\alpha+s)}-F~d z=0\n$$  \n\nThe function 1-s(1-α+s) is strictly increasing in c for L > 1-a+s and $\\begin{array}{r}{L^{T}(s,m)>\\frac{F}{1-\\alpha+s}}\\end{array}$ Therefore, Eq. (A.84) implies  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s){\\frac{L^{T}(s,m)-m F}{1-m(1-\\alpha+s)}}-F d z=(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s){\\frac{L^{T}(s,m)-m F}{1-m(1-\\alpha+s)}}-F<0\n$$  \n\nThat is, at $L^{T}(s,m)$ and a fortiori for $L<L^{T}(s,m)$ ,the $m$ -mass of monopolists make strictly negative profits if they produce and the $(1-m)$ -mass of independent monopolists do not. Therefore, the optimal government strategy for $L<L^{T}(s,m)$ is for the $m$ -mass of monopolists not to produce. It follows that all monopolists producing if and only if $L\\geq L^{T}(s,m)$ is the highest output the government can induce for any production strategy of the $m$ -mass of monopolists it controls. Q.E.D.  \n\n## Proof of Proposition 6  \n\nThe proof of Proposition 6 follows the same line as the proof of Proposition 2 of the baseline model. We just show here the comparative statics with respect to $m$ . Eq.

(A.89) is positive. From Proposition 5, a higher $m$ induces monopolists to coordinate more often on the Pareto-superior production action (i.e., $L^{T}(s,m)$ is increasing in $m\\in\\lfloor0,1)$ ), which implies that $\\textstyle{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial m}}W(s^{*},m)>0$ (i.e., that the second term in Eq. (A.89) is strictly positive) and therefore, that $\\frac{d W(s^{*}(m),m)}{d m}>0$ From Proposition 5, production is optimal for a given $s$ when $m\\to1$ , from Proposition 6 there is a unique symmetric operating leverage equilibrium at $t=0$ , and from Proposition 4, if frms coordinate on the Pareto-optimal production plan at $t=1$ , the symmetric operating leverage equilibrium at $t=0$ is socially optimal.

(A.91), monitoring does not affect agregate income $y$ for a given set of active monopolists $\\mathcal{A}$ : monitoring reduces the profit of each active monopolist by $\\beta^{\\prime}y$ but increases labor income by the same amount. Hence, the expression for $y$ obtained from Eq. (A.91) is as in Eq. (4),  \n\n$$\ny=\\frac{L-\\int_{q\\in A}F(s_{q})~d q}{1-\\int_{q\\in A}1-\\alpha+s_{q}~d q}.\n$$  \n\nConsider the case in which all monopolists choose the same operating leverage $s$ at $t=0$  \n\nThen combining Eq. (A.90) and Eq. (A.91), a monopolist does not operate if no other  \n\nmonopolist operates (if ${\\mathcal{A}}=\\{\\emptyset\\}$ )when  \n\n$$\nL<\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s}.\n$$  \n\nConversely, a monopolist operates if all other monopolists operate (if $\\mathcal{A}=[0,1]$ )when  \n\n$$\nL>\\frac{\\left(1-\\beta^{\\prime}\\right)F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s}.\n$$  \n\nTherefore, if  \n\n$$\nL\\in\\left(\\frac{(1-\\beta^{\\prime})F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s},\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s}\\right),\n$$  \n\nNotice that Eq. (3), Eq. (8), Eq. (9), and Eq. (10) are identical to Eq. (A.90), Eq. (A.93), Eq. (A.94), and Eq. (A.95) except that the first four equations depend on parameter $\\beta$ and the last four depend on parameter $\\beta^{\\prime}$ . Therefore, an equivalent to Proposition 1 still holds, that is, if monopolists choose $s$ , they operate at $t=1$ if $L\\ge L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)$ where  \n\n$$\nL_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)\\equiv\\frac{F(s)}{1-\\alpha+s}+\\frac{\\beta^{\\prime}F(s)}{(1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha-s}\\right)}.\n$$  \n\nTherefore, aggregate income is then given by  \n\n$$\ny_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s,L)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\frac{L-F(s)}{\\alpha-s}}&{\\mathrm{if~}L\\geq L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)}\\ {L}&{\\mathrm{if~}L<L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)}\\end{array}\\right..\n$$  \n\nSuppose monopolist $q$ chooses operating leverage $s_{q}$ while all other monopolists choose $s$ Monopolist $q$ produces when it makes a profit, that is, when  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s_{q}\\right)y_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s,L)-F(s_{q})\\geq0,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nor equivalently, when  \n\n$$\nL\\ge\\hat{L}_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s_{q},s)\\equiv\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\displaystyle{\\operatorname*{max}\\left\\{(\\alpha-s)\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s_{q}}+F(s),L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)\\right\\}}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}\\ge s,\\displaystyle{\\medskip}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\operatorname*{min}\\left\\{\\frac{F(s_{q})}{1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s_{q}},L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s)\\right\\}}}}&{{\\mathrm{if~}s_{q}<s.}}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThen $s_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*}$ is an equilibrium if and only if  \n\n$$\ns_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*}\\in\\underset{s_{q}}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{\\hat{L}_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s_{q},s_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*}),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*},L)-F(s_{q})d L.\n$$  \n\nNotice that Eq. (17) and Eq. (A.100) identical except that the frst equation depends on parameter $\\beta$ and the second equation depends on parameter $\\beta^{\\prime}$ . Therefore, one can show that an equivalent to Proposition 2 holds: there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium $s_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*}$ defined by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[y|L\\ge L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*})\\right]-F^{\\prime}\\left(s_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{*}\\right)=0.\n$$  \n\nThe social planer chooses leverage at $t=0$ but cannot avoid coordination failures at $t=1$ Hence, the constrained social optimum is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{s_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{o p t}\\in\\underset{s}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\displaystyle\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta^{\\prime}+s\\right)y_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s,L)-F(s)d L+}\\ &{\\qquad+\\displaystyle\\int_{\\operatorname*{min}\\{L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}^{T}(s),\\overline{{L}}\\}}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(\\beta^{\\prime}-\\beta\\right)y_{\\beta^{\\prime}}(s,L)d L.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNotice that the social planer's optimization problem in Eq. (A.102) is different from the problem in Eq. (19). In Eq. (19), the extra labor income $\\beta y$ earned by supervisors in states in which monopolists are active merely compensates them for their effort cost and therefore, labor income net of monitoring disutility always sums up to $L$ . Consequently, in Eq. (19) maximizing consumers’ expected utility amounts to maximizing their expected income from corporate profits. However, in Eq. (A.102) the extra labor income $\\beta^{\\prime}y$ earned by supervisors in states in which monopolists are active more than compensates them for their efort cost $\\beta y$ .Consequently, in Eq. (A.102) maximizing consumers′ expected utility amounts to maximizing the sum of the expected income from corporate profits plus the expected supervisors’ rent.

If $s_{q}=s^{*}$ then, at $L=L^{T}(s^{*})$ monopolist $q$ makes a strictly positive profit if all other monopolist operate and makes a strictly negative profit if no other monopolist operates. This implies that we can define an interval $[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ for some $\\tau>0$ such that if $s_{q}\\in[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ monopolist $q$ produces if and only if $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ .

Q.E.D.  \n\n## Online appendix: Production at t=0 and at t=1  \n\nIn the main model, monopolists choose their operating leverage at $t=0$ , before uncertainty about $L$ is realized at $t=1$ . This captures the idea that firms’ technological and organizational choices are long lasting and therefore, that frms cannot respond to a productivity shock by swiftly changing their production technologies. In this section, we extend the model to show that our results remain unchanged when monopolists also produce at $t=0$ and can condition their choice of operating leverage to the current ( $t=0$ ) productivity level, provided that they cannot rapidly adjust their operating leverage to accommodate realizations of future ( $t=1$ ) productivity shocks. Formally, this requires the following changes to the main model. We assume that production also takes place $t=0$ . That is, a productivity shock $L_{0}$ is realized at $t=0$ .Then, knowing $L_{0}$ , each monopolists makes an operating leverage decision, a production decision and the game moves on to $t=1$ .At $t=1$ , a new shock $L_{1}$ is realized and monopolists make a second production decision. Importantly, a monopolist cannot adjust its operating leverage between the two production decisions at $t=0$ and $t=1$ . The productivity shocks $\\left\\{L_{0},L_{1}\\right\\}$ are uniformly distributed over $[0,\\overline{{L}}]$ and independent. Similar to the main model, the consumer's utility is given by  \n\n$$\nU=\\exp\\left[\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln x_{1}(q)d q\\right]+\\theta\\exp\\left[\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln x_{2}(q)d q\\right],\n$$  \n\nwhere $x_{t}(q)$ is the consumption at $t$ defined over a unit interval of goods indexed by $q$ and $\\theta\\in(0,1]$ is a time discount factor. Everything else remains the same as in the main model:  \n\n(i) Each good $q$ is produced by a sector, and each sector consists of two types of firms. A competitive fringe of firms with a constant returns to scale technology in which one unit of output requires one unit of labour, and a monopolist with access to an increasing returns to scale technology; (ii) In each period $t$ , monopolist $q$ incurs a marginal cost of $\\alpha-s_{q}$ and a fixed cost of $F(s_{q})$ to produce, where $F(s_{q})$ is increasing, convex, and tends to infinity as $s_{q}\\to\\alpha$ ; and (i) Production by monopolists requires a monitoring effort $\\beta$ per unit of output.  \n\nThis extension poses a minor technical challenge. In the baseline model, the equilibrium of the production game is pinned down as the limit of a dispersed information game in which monopolists imperfectly observe $L$ after their choices of operating leverage but before their production decisions. (See Section 3.2.) However, the point of the current extension is to let monopolists observe $L_{0}$ before deciding their operating leverages at $t=0$ , which precludes having dispersed information about $L_{0}$ when monopolists make their production decisions at $t=0$ . To circumvent this problem while keeping the global games treatment of the production game identical to the baseline model, we assume that all monopolists perfectly observe $L_{t}$ at the beginning of each period $t$ . However, in each period, the realization of the shock is altered to be $L_{t}+\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ , where $\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ is normally distributed with mean O and variance $\\sigma^{2}$ . Furthermore, in each period, monopolist $q$ also observes a private noisy signal of $\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ ， ${{l}_{q,t}}={{\\mathcal{L}}_{t}}+{{\\xi}_{q,t}}$ , where $\\xi_{q,t}$ is normally distributed with mean O and variance $\\sigma_{\\xi}^{:2}$ . Importantly, at $t~=~0$ ，monopolist $q$ observes $l_{q,0}$ after its operating leverage decision but before its production decision. This design has the appealing property that we can take the limit to  \n\n0 of both $\\sigma_{\\xi}^{:2}$ and $\\sigma^{2}$ in a way that (i) maintains equilibrium uniqueness; (ii) leaves $L_{t}$ as the only shock at time $t$ (since $\\sigma^{2}\\rightarrow0$ ， $\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ is $0$ almost surely); and (ii) has monopolists producing at $t$ if and only $L_{t}\\geq L^{T}(s)$ , where $L^{T}(s)$ is the same threshold as in the baseline model. Fig. OA1 illustrates the timing of events.  \n\n![](images/caec140705bbe1166c179c9401fd8173b1c8c3529f35561955a9a202c80de17b.jpg)  \nFig. OA1. Timing of events.  \n\nProposition OA.1 below formally states the result that the global games treatment that we consider in this section delivers the same prediction for the production game as the prediction of the baseline model. (For the proofs of Propositions OA.1 and OA.2 below, see at the end of this appendix.)  \n\nProposition OA.1. Suppose all monopolists choose operating leverage s at $t=0$ ，thenif $\\sigma\\to0$ and ${\\frac{\\sigma_{\\xi}}{\\sigma^{2}}}\\to0$ , monopolists operate in period t if and only if $L_{t}\\geq L^{T}(s)$ ,where $L^{T}(s)$ is defined as in Eq. (13).  \n\nNext, we build on Proposition OA.1 to analyze the equilibrium operating leverage at $t=0$ Suppose monopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ while all other monopolists choose $s^{*}\\in(0,\\alpha)$ . If $s_{q}=s^{*}$ and $L=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , a monopolist $q$ makes a strictly positive profit at $t=1$ if all other monopolist operate and makes a strictly negative profit if no other monopolist operates. This implies that we can define an interval $[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ for some $\\tau>0$ such that if $s_{q}\\in[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ monopolist $q$ produces if and only if $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ . Then, $s^{*}$ being an equilibrium requires OA.3  \n\nthat  \n\n$$\ns^{*}\\in\\underset{s_{q}\\in[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]}{\\arg\\operatorname*{max}}\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathbf{1}_{\\{L_{0}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}\\left[\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L_{0})-F(s_{q})\\right]+}\\ {+\\theta\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L_{1})-F(s_{q})d L_{1}}\\end{array}\\right\\},\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\bf1}_{\\{L_{0}\\ge L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}$ is an indicator function that takes a value of one when $L_{0}\\geq L^{T}\\big(s^{*}\\big)$ From Eq. (OA.2), the local necessary first order condition for an interior solution writes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathsf{l}_{\\{L_{0}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}\\left[y\\left(s^{*},L_{0}\\right)-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)\\right]+\\theta\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(L_{1}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\right)\\left[E\\left[y\\big|L_{1}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\right]-F^{\\prime}\\left(s^{*}\\right)\\right]=0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe next proposition shows that around this local equilibrium condition, there is excessive operating leverage. The logic is identical to the one previously discussed for Proposition 3 and Proposition 10: at the equilibrium leverage $s^{*}$ , a marginal decrease in the leverage of all monopolists lead them to switch from inactivity to production just below $L^{T}(s^{*})$ (i.e., oLr(s) > 0) which improves welfare.  \n\nProposition OA.2. Consider a generic increasing and convec function $F(.)$ any symmetric interior equilibrium $s^{*}$ at $t=1$ satisfies condition in Eq. (0A.3), and a collective marginal decrease in operating leverage below $s^{*}$ increases welfare.  \n\n### Proof of Proposition OA.1  \n\nSuppose all monopolists choose $s$ at $t=0$ and monopolist $q$ with signal $l_{q,t}$ produces if and only if ${\\mathit{l}}_{\\mathit{q},t}>{\\mathit{l}}^{*}$ at time $t$ , for $t=1,2$ . Consider a monopolist who observes the signal $l^{*}$ . Its  \n\nOA.4  \n\nposterior of $\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ is normally distributed with mean $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}+\\sigma_{\\xi}^{2}}l^{*}}\\end{array}$ and variance $\\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\sigma_{\\xi}^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}+\\sigma_{\\xi}^{2}}$ Finally, for a given realization of $\\mathcal{L}_{t}$ , the mass of monopolists that produce at time $t$ is  \n\n$$\nn(\\mathcal{L}_{t})\\equiv1-\\Phi\\left(\\frac{l^{*}-\\mathcal{L}_{t}}{\\sigma_{\\xi}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Phi(.)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.

Suppose monopolist $q$ chooses $s_{q}$ while all other monopolists choose $s^{*}\\in(0,\\alpha)$ . If $s_{q}=s^{*}$ and $L=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , monopolist $q$ makes a strictly positive profit at $t=1$ if all other monopolist operate and makes a strictly negative profit if no other monopolist operates. This implies that we can define an interval $[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ for some $\\tau>0$ such that if $s_{q}\\in[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]$ , monopolist $q$ produces if and only if $L\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ . Then, $s^{*}$ being an equilibrium requires that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{s^{*}\\in\\underset{s_{q}\\in[s^{*}-\\tau,s^{*}+\\tau]}{\\mathrm{argmax}}\\mathbf{1}_{\\{L_{0}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}\\left(\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L_{0})-F(s_{q})\\right)+}\\ &{}&\\ &{}&{\\qquad+\\theta\\int_{L^{T}(s^{*})}^{\\overline{{L}}}\\left(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s_{q}\\right)y(s^{*},L_{1})-F(s_{q})d L_{1},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\bf1}_{\\{L_{0}\\ge L^{T}(s^{*})\\}}$ is an indicator function that takes the value of one when $L_{0}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ If $L_{0}\\geq L^{T}(s^{*})$ , the local necessary condition for an interior solution to the monopolist optimization problem in Eq.

(0A.34), is strictly negative.  \n\nFinally, total differentiation of the indifference condition in Eq. (OA.32) with respect to $s^{*}$ yields  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\int_{0}^{1}\\hat{y}(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},z)-F^{\\prime}(s^{*})~d z}\\ &{+\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*})\\frac{\\partial\\hat{y}(L,s,z)}{\\partial s}(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},.)~d z}\\ &{+\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{1}(1-\\alpha-\\beta+s^{*})\\frac{\\partial\\hat{y}(L,s,z)}{\\partial L}(L^{T}(s^{*}),s^{*},.)\\frac{\\partial L^{T}(s^{*})}{\\partial s^{*}}~d z=0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEq.

Consider now the case in which ${\\cal L}_{0}\\rightarrow{\\cal L}^{T}(s)^{-}$ (that is, in which $s\\to s^{*+}$ ).Since $L^{T}(s^{*})$ is increasing in $s^{*}$ (Lemma OA.1) and since monopolists make strictly positive profits at the threshold, $L=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , it follows there is a discrete increase in the welfare function at $s^{*}$ when $s$ approaches $s^{*}$ from above and monopolists start producing at $t=0$ , that is,  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow s^{*+}}W(s,L^{T}(s))<W(s^{*},L^{T}(s^{*})).\n$$  \n\nTherefore, an increase in operating leverage beyond $s^{*}$ decreases  welfare in an interval $(s^{*},s^{*}+\\delta)$ for some $\\delta>0$ . In summary, at $L_{0}=L^{T}(s^{*})$ , a decrease in $s^{*}$ increases welfare and an increase in $s^{*}$ decreases welfare. Q.E.D.  "

However, our understanding of the industry remains very limited. It is known that institutions present in East Asia shape the behavior of organizations that are present in the region. This article examines how institutions, particularly those related to the regulatory environment and culture of East Asia, shape the venture capital industry and create differences from the venture capital industry in the West. These differences are true despite the fact that many venture capitalists have been trained in Western venture capital firms and share similar beliefs about how venture investments are to be made. The article concludes with a research agenda for building a fuller understanding of how venture capital works in East Asia and what outside investors and firms need to familiarize themselves with.  \n\n$\\copyright$ 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction  \n\nVenture capital has been widely recognized as having an important function in regional economic development (Sapienza, Manigart, &Vermeir, 1996; Saxenian, 1994). The vital role it plays has helped to encourage interest in venture capital throughout the world (Gupta, 2000). To date most research on the industry has occurred in the West in spite of the industry's growth in other regions. In Asia, $\\$7.4$ billion of new funds were raised in 1998 alone (Guide to  \n\nVenture Capital in Asia, 2000). Though the funds invested by the venture capital industry play an increasingly important role in the economic vitality of the region (Ang, Lee, Lim, Singh, & Tan, 2000; Timmons, 1999; Wang & Sim, 2001), little is known about Asian venture capital in general, and East Asian venture capital in particular (Bruton, Dattani, Fung, Chow, & Ahlstrom, 1999; Wang & Sim, 2001).  \n\nA central argument in much of the research on global business is that firms are embedded in country-specific institutional arrangements (Busenitz, Gomez, & Spencer, 2000; Child, 2000). These institutions impact the behavior of both individuals and firms in subtle but pervasive ways (Ang et al., 2000; Peng, 2003; Scott, 1995, 2002). The institutional differences in countries extend beyond basic differences in culture to fundamental elements of a nation's laws, business norms, and commercial traditions (Kostova, 1997;  \n\nOrru, Biggart, & Hamilton, 1997; Peng, 2002). Institutions are typically situation specific, thus the institutional characteristics of a country are best examined with regard to a specific phenomenon such as the venture capital industry rather than in terms of general arrangements (Busenitz et al., 2000; Lowe, 1998; Orru et al., 1997).  \n\nThis article examines the practice of venture capital in East Asia. Of particular interest is how indigenous institutions (Lau,Tse, & Zhou, 2002; Tsui & Lau, 2002) affect the venture capital industry and create differences from that of the West.3 Attention is focused on venture capital in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. These regions represent three key centers of the venture capital industry in East Asia plus the three primary venture capital centers in East Asia dominated by Overseas Chinese. This ethnic group is well known for a number of idiosyncratic business practices that have created a distinctive commercial system (Chen, 2001; Weidenbaum, 1996). These practices and other local institutions shape behavior in that region and could be expected to impact the function of the venture capital industry. The venture capital industry in East Asia is also influenced by normative practices from the West. Thus, this article not only examines current institutional influences on the venture capital industry in East Asia, but also considers the future of the industry in the face of increasing globalization. Finally, a research agenda and implications for managers of this vital domain will be discussed based on these findings.  \n\n## 2. What is meant by venture capital?  \n\nVenture capital in the West is commonly associated with investments in early stage ventures where investment is made in return for an equity stake in a new business. Firms which make venture investments in later stage or mezzanine ventures or firms that invest in mature companies seeking to turn those enterprises around are not called venture capital firms in the West, rather they are associated with private equity financing. However, in East Asia the industry's dividing lines are not as distinct as in the West. Firms commonly do not focus on single types of investments as occurs in the West. Rather they focus on funding firms in narrower geographic regions as the ability to monitor funded firms is much more constrained due to travel and communication limitations (Ahlstrom, Bruton,& Chan, 2000; Bruton, Ahlstrom,& Singh, 2002). Thus, the term venture capital predominates in Asia but some of that activity would likely be called private equity in the West.  \n\n### 2.1. An overview of venture capital in East Asia  \n\nThe size of the overall East Asian venture capital industry can be measured a variety of ways. Three of the most common measures are number of venture capital companies, number of professionals in those companies, and capital under management. Table 1 provides summary statistics for the Asian venture capital industry.  \n\nThe industry in the United States (U.S.) has approximately twice as many firms as in Asia. However, the amount of money in the U.S. industry is much larger. To illustrate, in 1998 the private equity and venture capital industry together raised an estimated $\\$90$ billion in new capital while the comparable amount in Asia was around $\\$7$ billion. Overall, the industry in the West, particularly the U.s., is much larger and better established than in Asia. The size of the firms and the funds they raise are larger. The result is that venture capital professionals in the West must manage larger funds and typically make larger investments than do their counterparts in East Asia. Additionally, many of the mechanisms that support venture capitalists, such as services needed in conducting due diligence, are better established in the West.  \n\nTable 1 Overview of Asian venture capital   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Country</td><td>Number of companies</td><td>Number of professionals</td><td>Capital (U.S.millions)</td></tr><tr><td>Hong Kong/PRC</td><td>29</td><td>494</td><td>15,442</td></tr><tr><td>Indonesia</td><td>46</td><td>189</td><td>328</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>231</td><td>1,786</td><td>12,513</td></tr><tr><td>Korea</td><td>123</td><td>409</td><td>2,995</td></tr><tr><td>Malaysia</td><td>20</td><td>59</td><td>460</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore</td><td>64</td><td>331</td><td>5,258</td></tr><tr><td>Taiwan</td><td>124</td><td>356</td><td>3,598</td></tr><tr><td>Thailand</td><td>8</td><td>49</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Vietnam</td><td>7</td><td>28</td><td>258</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>752</td><td>3,701</td><td>40,867</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nSource of data:The2000 Guide toVentureCapital in Asia, published by TheAsianVenture CapitalJournal.  \n\nAs Table 1 shows, three of the principal centers of venture capital activity in East Asia are Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Ethnic Chinese dominate most elements of the economic life of these three geographic areas and have been shown to have strong cultural institutions that impact other business phenomenon (Chen, 2001). Focusing our examination on this particular ethnic group in these three particular locations in a single industry allows for greater control of extraneous variables.  \n\n## 3. Regional institutions and venture capital  \n\nIt has been argued that venture capitalists will follow a similar worldwide model of investing, particularly for later stage ventures (Jeng & Wells, 2000). This argument is based primarily on research that did not include firms from countries in Asia. However, it is widely recognized that East Asia has an environment and institutions that differ from those of the U.S. and Europe, which in turn can create extensive differences in commercial practice and activity (Boisot & Child, 1988, 1996; Chen, 2001; Orru et al., 1997; Peng, 2000). Some have summarized those differences under the heading of Confucian dynamism (Hofstede & Bond, 1988). Whereas in the West, efficiency, profit motive, and responsiveness to investors are thought to rank supreme, in East Asia, building legitimacy, maintaining harmony and securing connections are of key concern to businesspeople (Ahlstrom & Bruton, 2001; Chen, 2001). In trying to understand the venture capital industry in East Asia a key question is, do venture capitalists follow a Western model of venture capital or do they conform more to the East Asian environment with its numerous customs and differences, and what are the implications for the venture capital industry and the funding of entrepreneurial firms in East Asia?  \n\nInstitutional theory provides a useful lens through which to examine these questions. Central to institutional theory is the assertion that institutions in the environment have an impact on a range of commercial activity including the actions people take and those that they even consider possible. The institutional aspects that shape organizational activity include regulatory, normative, and cognitive components (Scott, 1995, 2002) and are examined in turn below.  \n\nRegulatory elements of institutions represent laws and sanctions that regulate the behavior of firms and individuals (North, 1990). Regulatory processes involve the setting of rules and their enforcement. For example, insider-trading laws persuade individuals and firms to neither take nor tolerate such actions. Thus, regulatory institutions include sanctions, laws, and regulatory fiat that regulate individual and organizational action (Scott, 1995). Financial and commercial rules in East Asia are generally less developed than those of the West, and even when rules are present they are often not as strictly enforced (Backman, 1999; Khanna & Palepu, 1999). This fact has strong bearing on contracts and corporate governance, key concerns to the venture capitalist (Phan, 2000). The weakness in regulatory institutions can make the selection process of firms to fund more difficult and thus more challenging for East Asian venture capitalists.  \n\nNormative elements of institutions define the roles or actions that derive from professional standards and are propagated through teaching and training (DiMaggio, 2001). To illustrate, the medical and accounting professions have developed strong norms of behavior through the education and training process for their respective professions (Freidson, 1986; Mezias, 1990). Similarly, an increasing amount of business activity occurs under the auspices of benchmarking or setting of behavior expectations of a firm by the behavior of leading firms in the industry; such benchmarking efforts help to establish normative institutions in the industry (DiMaggio, 2001). Much of the argument that venture capital in East Asia is converging withtheWesternmodelrestsonthefactthat the venture capital training is the same in East Asia and the West. Many East Asian venture capitalists have either worked for a Western firm where they received their training in the industry or currently are associated with Western venture capital firms in some manner. Those Western firms provide natural benchmarks for the behavior of venture capitalists in East Asia. Thus, the normative practice of venture capital in East Asia is strongly influenced by practices from the West with respect to what venture capitalists should be doing and how they should be doing it (Bruton, Manigart, Fried, & Sapienza,2001).  \n\nCognitive elements of institutions are most closely associated with culture in that they typically are created and carried by the culture of a given region (Berger & Lickman, 1967; Jepperson, 1991; Scott, 2002). These institutions typically include informal constraints embodied in traditions including subconsciously accepted rules and customs, and taken-forgranted commercial conventions. These cultural/cognitive institutions develop over time through social interactions among the various participants and shape their views on what actions are appropriate and conceivable (Scott, 2002). Consequently, certain actions embedded in a culture are often taken for granted and occur subconsciously.  \n\nWhen examining a widespread ethnic group across different industries and countries, particularly in locales whose regulatory regimes are not extensively developed, the cognitive aspects of an institutional system, transmitted primarily through the local culture, may hold the key to understanding the system's structure (Jepperson, 1991; Low, 2002). As noted before, the culture of the Overseas Chinese is known for its strong influence on managerial behavior and resulting differences from that of the West (Chen, 2001). Some recognition has been given to the importance of relationships, or guanxi, for commercial transactions in East Asia (Tsang & Walls, 1998). The cognitive institutions, such as guanxi could be expected to similarly impact venture capitalists in East Asia, particularly those activities that involve intense interpersonal interactions, such as selecting firms for funding and monitoring those firms.  \n\n## 4. Methodology  \n\n### 4.1. Research design  \n\nTo study the impact of institutions on venture capital and how venture capital in East Asia functions differently from that of the West, the researchers conducted a field study from 1998 to 2000 in the East Asian venture capital centers of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Focusing on these three regions meant reasonably consistent cognitive institutions could be expected since business is dominated by  \n\nOverseas Chinese in those economies, who share a common culture and set of commercial practices (Chen, 2001; Weidenbaum, 1996).  \n\nThe data were gathered using semi-structured interviews, then assembled and coded in a manner broadly consistent with a grounded theory research design (Eisenhardt, 1989; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin, 1990). In grounded research the researchers seek to examine a topic through an iterative process of comparing data to a baseline framework or to a new theory as it emerges from the data (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Thus, interviews were used in this research for four reasons. First, the venture capitalists often preferred face-to-face interviews over questionnaires. Second, it is often necessary when examining East Asian related business activity to establish a relationship with respondents in order to receive a response, which also diminishes the usefulness of questionnaires. This connection may come through a referral. Prior to contacting the venture capitalists such connections often needed to be arranged. Third, interviews are less structured than are questionnaires as they allow the spontaneous discussion of problems and solutions and for follow-up questions on a topic with the development of recommendations (Frey & Oishi, 1995; Lee, 1999). While we were specifically concerned with potential institutional effects on venture capital, we were also generally interested in understanding how venture capital works in East Asia. This method permits iteration and follow up as required in grounded theory. Finally, as this is a new area of study, the benefit of conducting in-depth interviews to develop a theoretical understanding of such a domain is well-established (Daft & Lewin, 1990; Eisenhardt, 1989; Lee, 1999).  \n\nThe inquiry framework was guided by an understanding of numerous agreed upon aspects of Western venture capital drawn from a variety of established sources in the domain (e.g., Fried & Hisrich, 1994; Gorman & Sahlman, 1989; MacMillian, Kulow, & Khoylian, 1988; Sapienza, 1992; Zider, 1998). Various sources have come to agree on several aspects of the U.S. venture capital industry. There is also evidence that these findings are also largely applicable in Europe (e.g., Sapienza et al., 1996). The findings on the Western venture capital industry can be organized into four broad topical areas that will direct the domains examined in this research: the selection process for firms to be funded, the monitoring of funded firms, value added activities provided to funded firms, and exit of the investment.  \n\n### 4.2. Sample  \n\nThe authors conducted a total of 60 semi-structured interviews with leading venture capital fund managers and other experts on venture capital in East Asia; there were an equal number of interviews in each region with the total sample representing approximately $25\\%$ of the venture capital firms active in the three regions at the time of the interviews. We followed a purposive sampling approach to the sample selection and subsequent follow up (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Purposive sampling calls for selecting participants with specific characteristics, such as extreme cases, typical cases, significant variation, or politically important cases (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). The venture capitalists were initially identified from the Guide to Venture Capital in Asia (1998). They were selected to ensure both a range of firms both in terms of size (large and small venture capital firms) and origin (locally founded as well as internationally-based). In the final sample, the median amount of funds under management was $\\mathrm{U}.\\mathrm{S}.\\mathrm{\\Phi}$ 110 million. At the high end, one firm had $\\$700$ million under management while the smallest firm stood at $\\$30$ million. In terms of specialty areas, in Taiwan, most firms specialized in electronics investments, although two were in life sciences. In Hong Kong, the firms invested in a wide range of sectors, although emphasis was on later stage investments such as property and infrastructure. There was some technology investing by Hong Kong venture capitalists, although mostly in Chinese language translation of popular U.S. Internet sites. Singapore was split evenly between private equity investments in established firms (hotels, property, infrastructure, consumer goods) and electronics; and thus Singapore lies between Taiwan and Hong Kong in venture capital emphasis.  \n\nIn addition,we alsointerviewed thefounders of four funded firms, two in Taiwan and one each in Hong Kong and Singapore, for additional insights on the venture capital process and to corroborate the information provided by the venture capitalists. These interviews helped to validate the results and provide some additional insights. Finally, we interviewed a government official in each location directly involved with promoting venture capital and technopreneurship for additional validation of the findings.  \n\n### 4.3. Interview protocol  \n\nAs noted earlier the researchers wished to gain a broad understanding of venture capital practice in East Asia. Therefore, data were gathered through semistructured interviews employing a replication logic approach to the interviews (Eisenhardt, 1989). That is, after collecting descriptive information about the firm and the venture capitalist background, we asked the respondent a number of open-ended questions. These questions examined the four topical areas identified from the Western literature. In addition, all interview subjects were asked to consider the major findings from the West on venture capital and to what extent these applied in East Asia. Appendix A provides an outline of topics covered and the questions asked.  \n\nIn the discussion that followed each succeeding interview the authors continued to employ replication logic to compliment the iterative, grounded research design (Eisenhardt, 1989). Thus, following the interviewee's overview of the venture capital industry in East Asia in the four topical areas and how the activities were different from the model presented from the West, the interviewers presented their summary of the emerging East Asian venture capital model based on previous interviews. The interviewee would then discuss how they agreed with or would clarify the emerging venture capital model to more accurately reflect what occurs in East Asia. After the interview, follow-up questions were often asked via the telephone or email. Thus, over the course of the interviews a consistent picture of venture capital in East Asia began to develop. We continued adding interviews in each country until incremental learning derived from the subjects became negligible (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).4 This process is the same as the one used by Fried and Hisrich (1994) when they examined venture capital decision-making in the U.S.  \n\nIn the subsequent interviews with funded firms, the interviewers asked senior managers in those firms the same questions. In addition, we asked them to respond to the tentative conclusions drawn from the first round of interviews and our review of the relevant literature.5 Similarly, the government officials were also asked their views of venture capital and their assessment of the East Asian model of venture capital as supplied by the venture capitalists.  \n\n### 4.4. Data analysis and validation  \n\nApproximately half of the interview subjects were ethnic Chinese subjects, and their command of English was such that all but two of the interviews were conducted in English. The interviews conducted in Chinese were translated at the time of the interview by a native Chinese speaker present. In addition, to ensure reliability, the native Chinese speaker also took notes at the interviews and these notes were later examined to ensure the information obtained was accurate. If any discrepancy occurred, the interview subject would be contacted for clarification. For all interviews, the results were summarized and venture capitalists were subsequently contacted for corroboration.  \n\nAll of the venture capitalists interviewed were responsible for funding decisions by their firms. In addition, all interview subjects of the venture capital firms were either a principal or a senior manager. For those in the funded firms, all those interviewed were firm founders. The government officials in the sample were also senior (at the departmental level) officials responsible for a variety of government venture capital initiatives in each of their respective three regions.  \n\nInterviews were coded for categories and subcategories by one investigator and one other researcher who was not part of the study. The initial categories were open coded (Strauss & Corbin, 1990) consistent with the key concepts well understood in venture capital such as venture investment selection, due diligence and exit.?  \n\nSubsequent institutional constructs were then coded and how they likely impact the main venture capital concepts were then identified and are summarized in Table 2. Reliability proved to be about ninety percent between the two coders, and there was also much agreement among the interview subjects. The results from each country were compared and a high degree of consistency was found as well. The summary findings were also shared with other leading venture capitalists in East Asia that were not part of the sample to get their observations and comments on the findings. To further validate the results, information was gathered from other sources such as industry authorities and government officials responsible for investment and industrial policy to further corroborate the data gathered. In general there was great consistency in the evidence gathered from all sources on all issues examined, though where disagreements occurred, these are also reported in the results. When there were additional observations and some differences, we have supplied those opinions and discuss explanations for these differences. These are all summarized in Table 2.  \n\nIn summary, apart from the replication logic used in building the model (Eisenhardt, 1989), there were three additional means by which the research findings were validated: (1) funded firms within each country were interviewed to ensure that the model developed accurately represented venture capital practice in that region; (2) government officials in all three regions were interviewed to provide validation and additional observations of the model; and (3) other prominent venture capitalists  and  industry participants  not involved with this research were contacted to assess the findings. These three sources all confirmed the accuracy of the results and interpretation while providing some amplification; these models of venture capital beliefs and behavior in turn were also generally consistent across countries. When some differences of opinion or emphasis emerged these have been reported in the results and summarized in Table 2.  \n\n## 5. Results  \n\nThe results are discussed below in terms of how each category of institutions impacted the various activities of venture capitalists in East Asia, highlighting key differences from that of the West. Results are first presented and additional insights on the impact of those types of institutions on the actions of venture capital are presented, and that is followed by a proposition to summarize the findings. Any disagreements or differing interpretations are also discussed.  \n\nTable2 Institutional forces in the U.S. and East Asia on venture capital   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>U.S.</td><td></td><td>EastAsia</td><td>Additional observations and dissenting views</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Regulatory Strong legal framework, generally transparent and well-regulated financial markets, and effective corporate governance system with strong protection for institutional investors and minority shareholders.</td><td>Legal system and corporate governance mechanisms are relatively weak, but are moving towardWesterncommonlaw standards.

Regulatory elements  \n\nThe regulatory elements reflect laws and sanctions that regulate the behavior of firms and individuals (North, 1990). Regulatory processes involve the setting of rules and their enforcement. Taiwan,  \n\nHong Kong and Singapore all possess some different laws concerning venture  capital.  The regulatory dimension in the three regions was consistently found to have an impact on how East Asian venture capitalistsfund newfirms.It wasalsofoundthat the regulatory dimension also significantly impacts exit from the funded firms. Each of these findings will be reviewed in turn.  \n\n#### 5.1.1.Investment selection  \n\nIn the West venture capitalists rely on financial and accounting information contained in the business plan to initially evaluate the proposal (McGrath, 1997; Wright, Thompson, & Robbie, 1992).7 Additionally, venture capitalists in the West use information present in the plan to assess the risk of the proposed ventures (Wright et al., 1992). While venture capital firms in East Asia prefer to fund firms that have established financials, the regulatory institutions (items set by law) impact the quality of the information presented. Timely, accurate, or useful information about the financial performance can be difficult to obtain. Thus, if a firm is not already established (three years of financials) the risks are typically considered too high for funding in East Asia, unless the firm's technology and business plan is exceptional.  \n\nThe selection process is also made more challenging by the difficulty of obtaining reliable data from which to conduct due diligence. One Singapore based venture capitalist commented ‘since investors have less protection here [in Singapore] than in the West, it helps to have other means to screen and select and investments.? The venture capitalists generally agreed that as legal protection against fraud is weaker and market and accounting information have numerous deficiencies in East Asia, it is helpful to know the principal of the funded firm and his or her family. Added  another  Singapore-based  venture  capitalist, \"this provides added protection as the firm principal is less likely to disappear or drop out of the investment because you know that individual as well as his or her family.\"’ Observed another Singapore-based venture capitalist:  \n\n... I apply [the importance of relationships] to venture capital and private equity deal making, both on the hiring side and investing side. For example, I love to do deals with people I have done deals with before. So you will find that although we might have done sixty or seventy transactions over the years, they have not been done with sixty or seventy different entrepreneurs, they have been done with twenty-five to thirty entrepreneurs. Many of them are repeat deals. The biggest risk in our business . . . is the people risk and when you do a repeat thing with the guy you have a good experience with, you have eliminated what I consider the biggest risk in the business—the people risk.  \n\nThus, while knowing firm principals, or knowing people that do, in the West is important in East Asia it was deemed so significant that it was a barrier that is difficult to surmount, if not impossible to overcome, in the selection process across East Asia. Overall, the selection process proved more difficult than in the West because the data that enables due diligence may not be readily available in East Asia. In addition, the absence of many legal protections and lack of case precedent in these countries generally make the enforcement of the contracts more difficult if problems arise.8 Thus we propose:  \n\nProposition 1:The less developed regulatory institutionsinEastAsiaoftenleadstoanabsenceofvalid andreliableinformationonafirmseekingfunding.As a result the selection process of firms to fund is more difficult and time consuming forventure capitalists in EastAsia.  \n\n#### 5.1.2. Exit  \n\nAnother area that the weakness of regulatory structures impact is exit from the venture. In the West venture capital firms are usually organized as limited partnerships with a fixed life (Sahlman, 1988). Thus, the goal of most venture capital firms is to exit their investments through initial public offering (IPO) in five to seven years. Most private equity investors in East Asia also expect to exit through IPOs or strategic sales of the funded firm, although a shorter time frame of two to three years is common since the ventures that are funded are typically more mature in East Asia. However, exiting can be problematic, even from successful, growing ventures.  \n\nIn Taiwan the TASDAQ is fairly well established but in Hong Kong and Singapore it is considered more difficult for young firms to obtain a listing on a stock market, and even when it does occur it usually takes much longer (Wang & Sim, 2001). Thus venture capitalists pointed out that a more frequently employed exit strategy in these locales is to have the firm locate a strategic buyer. However, finding such ideal strategic partners can be challenging, and when exiting via a sale to a strategic partner, the multiple paid on the firm's revenue stream results in a return significantly lower than that traditionally associated with an IPO.  \n\nOne result of these exit difficulties is that many venture capital firms have discovered that when they do exit, their returns have not been as high as expected. Private equity firms in East Asia regularly reported a targetof $20-30\\%$ return, but actual returns for many funds have been much lower (Asia Pacific Private Equity Bulletin, 1998). A number of different regions have announced the introduction of NASDAQ-type markets for smaller firms, such as Taiwan's TASDAQ and Hong Kong's Growth Enterprise Market (GEM). These new markets may help alleviate the exit problem for venture capitalists to some degree. Nevertheless, because of reduced liquidity in the market and stricter listing laws exit through an IPO is far from straightforward (Wang & Sim, 2001). Thus we propose:  \n\nProposition 2: The underdeveloped regulatory institutions in East Asia suppress the development of listing mechanisms for new startup firms. The resulting exit from fundedventures inEast Asia will bemore constrained and complex for the venture capitalist thanintheWest.  \n\n### 5.2. Normative elements  \n\nThe normative elements of an institutional system are those well-accepted values, beliefs and practices shared by professions, groups and opinion leaders in a field, often propagated through education, textbooks, training and consulting (DiMaggio, 2001; Scott, 1995). Venture capital requires extensive interaction between the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur they fund. Particularly, the monitoring of the funded firm requires extensive interaction since the published information may not provide an accurate indication of the firm's performance. Thus, the normative values of the venture capitalist and how these values interact with those of the funded entrepreneur in monitoring the firm will be reviewed in turn.  \n\n#### 5.2.1. Values  \n\nEast Asian venture capital norms generally proved similar to what is known about venture capitalists in the West from authors such as Fried and Hisrich (1995). The venture capital industry in East Asia developed principally as individuals and firms from the U.S. and Europe moved into East Asia. The result is that most venture capitalists in East Asia have worked for or been trained in the U.S. or Europe. Additionally, venture capital associations hold training programs throughout East Asia that encourage professional standards that are very similar to U.S. venture capitalist. These two factors help to produce a set of normative values among the venture capitalists very consistent with those from venture capitalists in the West.? Thus we propose:  \n\n# Proposition 3: Normative values of venture capitalists in East Asia will generally bevery similar to those found in theWest.  \n\n#### 5.2.2. Monitoring  \n\nThe venture capitalist must interact with entrepreneurs of funded firms extensively in monitoring investments. Thus, the normative values of indigenous entrepreneurs must also be considered in examining the venture capitalist actions in this domain (Lau et al., 2002). The result is that one key difference in normative practice from that of the West that emerged in East Asia is that monitoring is done much more through personal interactions with the entrepreneur who founds the firm.  \n\nIn the West venture capitalists monitor their investment mostly through direct interaction with the entrepreneur. However, venture capitalists and the entrepreneur know that they will also monitor the investment through firm financials and via the venture capitalist's membership on the board of directors (Fried, Bruton, & Hisrich,1998;Fried & Hisrich, 1992, 1995; Rosenstein,1988; Sapienza, 1992). Accounting rules and reporting standards around East Asia can deviate significantly from international norms (Broadman, 1999; Low, 2000; Peng, 2000). Even in those cases that there are financials produced by one of the established international accounting firms, there can be considerable concerns about the validity of the information presented. As one venture capitalist interviewed recalled, “just because there are audited statements from an international accounting firm does not mean there are not multiple sets of books in the firm.\" Another venture capitalist added that you should be prepared to go into a firm and count things yourself. Thus, the normative values of entrepreneurs help to shape the utility of the company information that the venture capitalist will receive.  \n\nIn terms of monitoring via the board, it cannot be assumed that the venture capitalist will receive a board seat in East Asia (Low, 2002). But even if a board seat is obtained it may not mean what it does in the West. As noted, corporate governance is weak in the three regions examined with only limited influence of outside directors (Peng, 2000). Additionally, the information received may be less than accurate. For example, one venture capitalist reported that it is not uncommon for the minutes of board meetings to be written before the meeting has actually started, complete with readymade quotes from that venture capitalist.  \n\nTherefore, some of the traditional means to monitor the funded firm in mature economies such as obtaining regular accounting and financial information and board membership may provide fewer insights in East Asia. If the venture capitalists are to properly monitor their investment they must develop trust with the entrepreneur so that they obtain the desired information and ensure its accuracy. Such trust between the funded firm and the venture capitalist is consistent with the nature of communication between parties in Chinese culture. In this cultural setting there are typically clear insiders and outsiders (Goa, Ting-Tooney, & Gundykunst, 1996), and the fow of information to outsiders is severely restricted. Several venture capitalists reported that they had to work very hard to build trust with their funded firms to secure even a modicum of information.Some of the same monitoring approaches used in the West are relevant, while other different circumstances and practices in East Asia compel venture capitalists to monitor investments differently, specifically focusing on building a relationship with the entrepreneur for which the project is funded. Thus we propose:  \n\nProposition 4: The normative values of funded entrepreneursresultinmonitoringactivitiesinEastAsia that require venture capitalists to place emphasis on having or building relationships with funded entrepreneurs. The result is that the monitoring time, effort and costs will be higher than those for venture capitalists in theWest.  \n\n### 5.3. Cognitive elements  \n\nThe cognitive elements of institutions are commonly transmitted through culture, of which in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, is predominantly the culture of the Overseas Chinese (Chen, 2001; Jepperson, 1991; Scott, 2002). Overseas Chinese culture particularly impacts actions of managers by imparting greater importance to relationships among business people, thus impacting how venture capitalists can add value to funded firms (Chen, 2001).  \n\nThe interviews revealed that the venture capitalists see the cultural/cognitive institutional elements (Scott, 2002) as having a great impact on their day to day activities. For example, these elements have a significant impact on the nature of the value added venture capitalists can provide to funded firms. The interviewees stressed the U.S. venture capital industry infuences their training. The terms they used, their goals, and the values they expressed as to what the appropriate actions were for venture capitalists were generally consistent with those expressed by venture capitalists in the U.s. However, it was clear in these discussions that the venture capitalists in East Asia also are influenced by the environment in which they compete. The weaker regulatory system in East Asia in particular means that the culture of the region may become even more important in assuring that the actions desired are actually pursued (Chen, 2001). The ability of venture capitalists to compel a funded firm to perform certain activities is constrained by the weaker legal and enforcement regime in East Asia. Thus, culture as a means of influencing behavior becomes even more salient. Reflected one Singapore venture capitalist:  \n\nIn the [United] States, you have laws that people respect and are enforced. In Asia, that is often not the case. At our company, we try to do deals with people we know, or others know. And it helps if [the entrepreneur's] family is here also. Then we can get to know them. This way, it makes it harder for people to slack off, or even skip town with our money. We can always go to his family and ask what is happening with their son. They usually will not want to be embarrassed. . . This [influence of the family]is helpful with our due diligence and monitoring.  \n\nWhen examining a widespread ethnic group across different industries and countries, particularly in locales whose regulatory regimes are not extensively developed, the cognitive-based institutions, transmitted primarily through the local culture are a focus of concern (Chen, 2001; Jepperson, 1991; Peng & Heath, 1996). As noted before, the culture of East Asia has already been known for its strong influence on managerial behavior resulting in actions that differ from what would occur in similar situations in the West (Chen, 2001). Two particularly important aspects of cognitive institutions will be examined in turn.  \n\n#### 5.3.1. Guanxi  \n\nOne particular cultural issue stood out in the interviews. It was noted previously that the commercial regulatory regime in East Asia is still weak in many areas. One means that has developed to assure performance across a wide range of businesses is that there should be a relationship of some type between the parties. The relationship may not be sufficient to assure that the business activity between the two parties occurs but it is a necessary condition before the business activity is even considered. This relationship can be such that the parties went to the same school, their families are friends, they are related, or share significant business interests with others.  \n\nThe effect of such relationships is that cultural control is established. As a result, in East Asia some relationships between the venture capitalist and the funded firm's top management may have to be present for funding to be considered. Relationships between venture capitalists and their relevant networks of investors, entrepreneurs, and other venture capitalists are also important in the U.S. (Bartlett, 1995), but in East Asia guanxi or connections between various parties are particularly crucial. Guanxi is very helpful to the venture capitalist in conducting due diligence, successfully interacting with the firm, and ensuring the firm achieves the desired results.  \n\nThus we propose:  \n\nProposition 5: Cognitive institutional elements in East Asia will result in the actions of venture capitalists being particularly impacted by the consequences of guanxi.  \n\n#### 5.3.2. Value added to funded firm  \n\nOne of strengths of venture capital in the West is the value added to the firm by the venture capitalist (Bygrave, 1987; Zider, 1998). Providing value added to the firm through advice and services provided is also increasingly the case in East Asia's venture capital industry (Ahlstrom et al., 2000). However, this is a recent change. Initial private equity investors tended to be passive financial investors. But, increasingly, the interest is to provide added value to the firm in a manner consistent with venture capitalists in the West.  \n\nIn the U.s., for example, the advice provided to the CEO of the funded firm is often very direct and may occur in regular interaction between the venture capitalist and the CEO (Fried & Hisrich, 1995). However, in East Asia the manner in which the venture capitalist typically provides the advice to the CEO is different. As noted, the CEO of the firm culturally plays a paternal role that impacts the flow of information and organization. Thus, the venture capitalist in East Asia must deal appropriately with the key cultural factor of minzi—face or respect. In other words, the appearance of appropriate difference to an individual's status in the society and the firm. It is arguable that even in the West the issue of face is important. However, its relative greater importance in a Chinese-based culture is widely recognized (Bond, 1988). Additionally, in Chinese culture there is a bias to avoid conflict. Therefore, several venture capitalists indicated that one needs to advise a manager in a manner that allows the maintaining of face and avoiding of conflict. For example, rather than giving an ultimatum, an idea might be put forth as a suggestion. One Hong Kong venture capitalist commented:  \n\nThe setting where suggestions are provided is important. A venture capitalist should never make bold suggestions in front of a manager's subordinates. The venture capitalist should take the manager aside and make the recommendation in private. This way, the manager can remain “in charge’ and take credit for the changes. It is important to give face to the entrepreneurs you fund—some are very sensitive to this.  \n\nThus we propose:  \n\nProposition 6: Cognitive institutional elements in East Asia exert strong infuence on the manner in which value is added to the firm by venture capitalists.  \n\n## 6. Discussion  \n\nThe evidence here suggests that a range of institutional elements present in East Asia influence the actions of venture capitalists located in the region, in spite of similar training and norms as venture capitalists in the West. These institutions create several differences from venture capital practice in the West that venture capitalists and investors need to be aware. The institutional elements (regulatory, normative, cognitive) can all exert influence; however, the less formal cognitive institutional elements may play the strongest role. In particular, the cognitive institutions as exemplified by the  Overseas Chinese commercial culture  strongly shape the behavior of the venture capitalist in East Asia.  \n\nThe Western and East Asian models of venture capital developed within very distinct institutional frameworks (Scott, 1995, 2002). In East Asia the distinguishing characteristic includes the fact that most East Asian economies have a deeply entrenched concentrated ownership structure, with significant family control of firms, and interlocking shareholdings among firms, characteristic of Overseas Chinese business practice (Allen, 2000; Chen, 2001; Zhuang, 1999). These normative and cognitive institutions combine with the weak regulatory system and poor corporate governance (regulatory institutions) to create different and unusual challenges for venture capitalists working in East Asia.  \n\nThese distinctive institutions have led to many differences in the implementation of the various activities by the venture capital industry in East Asia. For example, the nature of the regulatory institutions means venture capitalists must conduct due diligence as part of their firm selection quite carefully. One Singapore-based venture capitalist related a story that during a due diligence investigation it was found that a funded firm failed to have much of the inventory that was stated on its books. The inventory was actually being held by a sister firm in a different part of SouthEast Asia. When asked about it, the funded company founder retorted that the inventory was still under its control, albeit some 1,500 kilometers from where it was reported to have been, and that there was nothing to worry about. The lack of regulatory institutions and  sometimes  different commercial  norms makes close monitoring of funded firms quite important in East Asia, albeit challenging.  \n\nVenture capitalists in the three regions examined often fund businesses that have some activities in Mainland China as well. The difficulties in implementing venture capital activities there are even more severe because of the paucity of laws and their enforcement in many industrial sectors (Ahlstrom, Young, & Nair, 2002; Bruton & Ahlstrom, 2002; Lubman, 1999). To illustrate, the need for due diligence in China is even more critical since assets can gradually or even suddenly disappear if not watched carefully, with the complicity of the local law enforcement (Ahlstrom et al., 2002). For example, one Hong Kong-based private equity firm helped to fund an existing business that was long established. However, due to the inability to properly do (personal) due diligence and monitor the China-based firm, the private equity firm found that one day that firm had closed without any warning to anyone and the entrepreneur had taken everything of potential value from the funded firm. He even carted off all the porcelain toilets bathroom fixtures from every foor of the building.  \n\nThe nature of the normative institutional elements present in the East Asian region also can impact the implementation of some common venture capital activities. For example, the difficulty in gathering needed information to monitor funded firms has led many venture capitalists to focus their efforts primarily on given geographic areas where they know people and can travel to regularly, rather than on specific industries as would be more common among venture capitalists in the West (Bruton et al., 2001). Additionally, the strong role of the owner/manager leads the individual to often view the funds provided by the venture capitalist to be their personal funds. One venture capitalist related how this view resulted in expenditures for houses and cars. Thus, venture capitalists must closely monitor the funds expenditures to ensure they are spent as intended.  \n\nSimilarly, owner/managers in the region see venture capitalists only as passive financial investors. Historically this has often been the role the venture capital industry was reduced to playing. However, today venture capitalists are seeking to be more active investors and provide value to the funded firm on different levels (Gupta, 2000). Thus, the venture capitalists today must often educate entrepreneurs about the venture capital process and their expectations.  \n\nThe cognitive element of guanxi also relates to another key implementation issue. For example, venture capitalists need to ensure that they understand not only the prospective funded firm's business model and capabilities, but also any local-partner relationships, and government connections the firm top management team (particular its founder) has. As one venture capitalist put it:  \n\nIn a business situation, try to understand the context of the word ‘friend’ or pengyou to learn what level of influence or actual guanxi really exists and whether your friend has the interest to use his or her friendship for you or for others to your benefit.  \n\nWithout the benefit of such guanxi or connections, the ability to judge the credit worthiness of the entrepreneurs and their idea is limited. Additionally, without such connections the ability to accurately monitor the funded firm can also be insufficient. The role of such connections also means that new venture capital firms must be careful to include key individuals who have such an understanding, or the venture capital firm will be at a disadvantage until it can build the necessary connections. Institutions in East Asia and their influence as compared to those of the West are summarized in Table 2.  \n\nIt is important to note that while there were broad similarities in the venture capital industries in the three countries examined there were also subtle differences. Among the three regions the Taiwanese industry was most focused on high technology investing. Thus, it was in Taiwan where high risk, high return venture capital investing was most likely to occur. For example, there is an established (although not closely regulated) gray market for shares of technology-focused firms prior to their public listing in Taiwan. The result of this market is that there is some exit opportunities for venture capitalists not available in the rest of Asia.  \n\nSimilarly, the role of the government in the venture capital industry in Singapore differs from that of the other two governments. The Singapore government provides an important part of the venture capital available in Singapore. The government has a nonintervention attitude towards the management of these funds. However, the government does encourage the funds to seek out international opportunities in the U.S. and Europe for investment. The belief is that such investments will strengthen the normative values of the venture capital industry in that nation and align them more with those of the venture capital industry in the West. As a result the Singapore venture capital industry is more focused on ensuring values and behaviors consistent with those in the U.S. or Europe. Thus, there are subtle but pervasive differences in the venture capital industries even in the three regions examined. Future research should examine these differences among other topics in the future.  \n\n### 6.1. The future of venture capital in East Asia  \n\nThere are significant differences between the venture capital industries of the West and East Asia. At the end of the interviews the venture capitalists and government officials also discussed their view of the future of venture capital in East Asia. Specifically, they focused on whether the differences identified here will persist over time or whether the Western and East Asian industries will converge in the future.  \n\nAs noted before, the normative values of the venture capitalists in the West and in Asia are generally similar due to the nature of their training and propagation of professional standards. However, it came clear in the resulting discussion there are other changes occurring among the normative institutions of the entrepreneurs in East Asia that are driving the venture capital industry in the West and Asia closer. The firms coming forward to ask for funding are no longer focused in more mature and primary resource industries. Instead, a variety of technopreneurial startups are increasingly considered for funding by venture capitalists in the East Asia.  \n\nMoreover, the nature of the entrepreneurs coming forward to ask for funding is changing. Historically, most of the top graduates from universities in the region sought to go to work for large corporations. Today however, the best and the brightest from universities are increasingly seeking to start their own firms, particularly in high technology areas. These students’ models are great entrepreneurs from the West such as Bill Gates and Steven Jobs so they seek to act accordingly. Additionally, increasing numbers of prospective entrepreneurs are returning from universities in the West and are bringing new ideas and expectations for the venture capitalist with them. Finally, since many of the firms have a strong technology focus, the need for such businesses to more fully integrate and cooperate with other firms around the world encourages the firms to become more like those firms. Thus, firm selection can increasingly be expected to become more similar to the West.  \n\nAdditionally, entrepreneurs also increasingly understand that the venture capitalists can offer financial and strategic managerial advice that will help firms achieve their goals. Thus, they are more willing to share information with the venture capitalists and take their value added activities. There are changes in the institutions in East Asia that are providing means for these entrepreneurs to have their new startups publicly listed which, in turn, helps to increase the interest of high quality individuals. The opening in the region of exchanges such as Hong Kong's new Growth Enterprise Market stock market has created opportunities for entrepreneurs that did not exist before. The result is that the role of monitoring and exit will also become more similar to the West in the future. Thus, overall, it is likely that venture capitalists in East Asia will increasingly behave in manners very similar to their counterparts in the West. There are, however, institutional forces in East Asia that will continue to differ from those of the West. Although there are efforts in East Asia to change some of the laws and to improve enforcement and corporate governance, for instance, significant differences between the institutional profiles of the West and East Asia remain. These differences will mean that the practice of venture capital in East Asia will continue to vary from that of the West.  \n\n### 6.2.

Does this reliance on relationships reduce or increase the role of venture capitalists as a source of such connections?

Finally,howdoestheadditionofthenewexchangesinEast Asiachangethe natureofexit?  \n\nThe economies of East Asia are playing a bigger part in the world economy. The ability to understand business in this region, particularly entrepreneurial activity will provide key insights regarding this important part of the world economy (Peng, 2000). It is especially important for managers and investors from the West to understand how institutions in different regions such as East Asia impact business and investment in those regions (Tsui & Lau, 2002). It is known that venture capital is crucial for entrepreneurial and industrial development (Timmons, 1999). Thus, by continuing this exploration of East Asian venture capital, greater insight should be possible regarding this vital region of the world, its emerging firms and its salient institutions and ways of doing business.  \n\n# Acknowledgments  \n\nThe work in this article was substantially supported by a grant from the RGC Research Grant Direct Allocation Scheme (Project no. 2070212, 2000- 2001) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  \n\nAppreciation is expressed to John Staal of ABN Amro Hong Kong, Katherine $\\mathrm{Ng}$ of the Hong Kong Venture  Capital  Association  and Professor  Mike Wright of the Centre for Management Buy-out Research, Nottingham University Business School, University of Nottingham for their helpful comments and discussions.  \n\n# Appendix A.

Introduction  \n\nThe traditional energy structure dominated by oil, coal and natural gas has not only increased the country's dependence on foreign imports and stimulated conflicts between energy supply and demand, but also further led to global warming and ecological environment deterioration. Therefore, accelerating the development and efficient utility of renewable NE turns out to be an inevitable way for countries to promote the upgrading of energy structure and environmental protection. The Chinese government has always attached great importance to the positive role of NE in coping with climate deterioration, energy shortage, and promoting energy conservation, emission reduction, and low-carbon green transformation [1-4]. In 2010 , the State Council promulgated the \"Decision of the State Council on Accelerating the Cultivation and Development of Strategic Emerging Industries\", which clearly classified NE as a strategic emerging innovative industry in China and mainly develops NE industries such as solar photovoltaic energy, wind power energy, hydro energy, nuclear energy, biomass energy, Marine energy, hydrogen energy, small hydropower and natural gas hydrate. In practical, China's NE industry started late and developed slowly, mainly rely on government subsidies and clean energy promotion projects to expand the NE industrial scale at the early stage. For example, during the period from 2009 to 2013, only two national key support projects in the photovoltaic power generation industry-Golden Sun Demonstration Project and Photovoltaic Construction Project, the government has subsidized them as much as 38 billion yuan. In the past decade, driven by strong promotion of government policies, China's NE industry has achieved a great leap forward [5]. In 2019, China's photovoltaic and wind power generation capacity reached 224.26 and 405.7 billion kilowatt-hours, and the cumulative installed capacity reached 2.043 and 2.1 million kilowatts respectively, which make it rank first in the world. At the same time, the scale of industries such as biomass energy, Marine energy, hydrogen energy, small hydropower, and natural gas hydrate is also expanding rapidly. Though government subsidy policies and clean energy promotion policies, in the short run, contributed to the simultaneous surge of installed capacity and electricity generation of NE industry, the phenomenon of overcapacity and insufficient innovation motivation is getting worse.Excessivegovernmentsubsidiestend todistortthemarket price of NE industry, induce NE enterprises to expand production to pursue economies of scale, reduce the motivation of NE enterprises to carry out innovation activities[6]. Technology innovation is an important index to measure a country's national comprehensive strength and international competitiveness. Therefore, under the background of the gradual exit of government subsidies policies in NE industry, NE enterprises urgently need to make full use of the market to allocate resources and constantly push the boundaries of technology to achieve sustainable industrial development through market means.  \n\nNE industry is one of the most promising industries in the world, and has the characteristics of high investment, high risk and high potential profitability [7]. Venture capital is a new market-oriented means of financing, which can give NE enterprises greater flexibility and influence enterprise innovation by injecting capital and indirectly participating in management [8]. Under the background of the declining of government subsidies, it is of great significance tostudythe influence of themarket-orientedmeansofventure capital on the innovation of Chinese NE enterprises. Compared with the existing literature, this study makes contributions as follows: First of all, the NE industry is a strategic emerging industry in China. It is of great significance to investigate the impact of venture capital as a market-oriented financing method on the innovation of NE enterprises to realize the purpose of emission reduction and lowcarbon green development. Secondly, in view of the development status of venture capital industry, this study explores the different impacts of government participation and joint venture capital on the innovation of NE enterprises from the perspective of venture capital heterogeneity, filling the gap in previous studies. Finally, from the perspective of geographic proximity, this study further analyzes the innovative effects of local investment in each region by government participation venture capital and local investment by joint venture capital on the innovation of NE enterprises, which also provides a new perspective on the existing research of venture capital on enterprises innovation.  \n\n## 2. Theoretical mechanism and research hypothesis  \n\n### 2.1. Venture capital and NE enterprises innovation  \n\nCurrently, there is still controversy about the impact of venture capital on enterprise innovation. Some scholars argue that venture capital, constrained by experience, human resources and market rules, does not have the expected \"incubation\" effect on enterprise innovation. Chen (2011) [9] takes China's Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) high-tech enterprises as a research sample, and finds that venture capital failed to bring more innovation achievements and innovation benefits to invested enterprises. Using a study of 940 manufacturing andbusiness service sector enterprisesin the United States and the United Kingdom, Lahr and Mina (2016) [10] find that venture capital does not have a significant impact on enterprises innovation and even has a negative impact on future patent applications of the invested enterprise. However, most scholarshave certified the innovative effect of venture capital on enterprises. Wonglimpiyara (2007) [11] proves that in Thailand, Small and Medium-sized Development Bank can realize the diffusion and commercialization of national technological innovation by setting up venture capital to finance high-risk and high-potential technology start-ups. By using panel data from 17 EU countries, Faria (2014) [12] argues that venture capital can stimulate innovation in the later stage. In China, Wei et al. (2015) [13] believe that compared with bank loans, venture capital can more effectively enhance the green innovation capabilities of China's real industry. By taking GEM and Small Medium Enterprise (SME) board enterprises as the object, Zhang and Zhang (2016) [14], and Gu (2019) [15] find that enterprises with venture capital are more innovative and obtain more patents than those without venture capital, confirming that venture capital can effectively stimulate enterprises innovation.  \n\nNE generation has problems of high operating costs and low market competitiveness [16]. In addition, the technology innovation of NE industry has high risks and large capital demands, it is difficult to completely rely on the NE enterprise's own funds for innovation. Venture capital is a kind of equity capital specialized in high-risk and potentially high-return project investment [17-19], which can influence the innovation of NE enterprises in the followingways.  \n\nFirstly, venture capital can directly alleviate the constraints of innovative financing of enterprises by injecting capital into NE enterprises [20,21]. At the same time, it also sends positive\"signals\" of the quality of NE enterprises to external stakeholders [22-25], which can help broaden financing channels of enterprises. Using data from 133 Chinese enterprises , Zhang and Liao(2011) [20] examine the relationship between venture capital and enterprises Initial Public Offerings (IPO), and find that venture capital can provide enterprises with capital in addition to increasing their profitability in order to perform well in the stock market. By studying the treatment effect of venture capital on enterprise financial condition, Li et al. (2021) [23Jalso find that the involvement of venture capital can increase enterprise transparency and information disclosure, reduce information asymmetry between enterprise and external stakeholders, and thus increase the likelihood of commercial bank loans.  \n\nSecondly, through indirect participation in enterprises management [26-29], venture capital institutions can bring advanced management and operation systems to NE enterprises,broaden NE enterprises sales channels through their own social networks, and provide material foundation for NE enterprises’ innovation [30-32]. Using a sample of Chinese GEM-listed enterprises, Chu et al. (2021) [33] find that venture capitals tend to participate in the internal enterprises governance and use equity and options to incentivize enterprises innovation. Savaneviciene (2015) [28] also believes that venture capital excels at employing professional talents to improve enterprise specialization, production efficiency and innovationpotential.  \n\nThirdly, Innovation capability is an important indicator to reflect the long-term value of an enterprise. Venture capital pays more attention to the cultivation of enterprise innovation capabilities, and achieves long-term growth of NE enterprises through the continuous development of new technologies and new products,in order to obtain excess investment returns when exiting [10]. By applying a multiple linear regression model, Jin et al. (2016) [34] investigate the relationship between venture capital and firm value appreciation, and find that venture capital can achieve enterprise value growth by increasing Research and Development(R&D）investment and developing new products. Based on the above analysis, the following hypotheses are proposed:  \n\nH1. Venture capital has a positive and significant impact on the innovation of NE enterprises.  \n\n### 2.2.Government participation venture capital and NE enterprises innovation  \n\nIn recent years, China has established government guidance funds and implemented preferential policies for venture capital to support the development and growth of innovative enterprises [35,36]. Such government participation venture capital usually has policy guidance and can use its own political network to provide scarce resource support for enterprises, ease the constraints of innovation financing, and provide innovation support for NE enterprises. Huang et al. (2020) [37] find that government participation venture capital can significantly promote the innovation of GEM listed enterprises and technology-based start-ups. Xie et al.(2018) [38] also argue that government participation venture capital can effectively promote the innovation of state-owned enterprises [33]. However, sometimes government venture capital deviates from the original policy intentions in practice, making it difficult to play a leading role in industrial innovation. Luukkonen et al.(2013) [39] believe that the contribution of European venture capital with a government background to the business philosophy and value-added management of high-tech enterprises is significantlylower than that of venture capitalwith other backgrounds [35]. Bertoni and Tykvova (2015) [40] take European biotech enterprises as a sample and found that venture capital with a government background did not promote enterprises innovation [35]. New energy is the key strategic emerging industry in China, and it is necessarytoexamine theimpact ofgovernmentparticipation venture capital on theinnovation of NE enterprises.Based on the development status of the NE industry, the following hypotheses areproposed:  \n\nH2. Government participation venture capital is more conducive to the innovation of NE enterprises.  \n\n### 2.3. Joint venture capital and NE enterprises innovation  \n\nAccording to the number of venture capital institutions involved in NE enterprises, venture capital can be divided into independent venture capital and joint venture capital. Compared with independent venture capital, joint venture capital on one hand can provide more abundant funds and professional talents, on the other hand can improve the social network[41] and form resource complementary advantages for invested enterprises [42-44]. All these will provide good material foundation for the innovation of NE enterprises. Cheng and Tang (2019) [45] argue that in an uncertain industrial environment, independent venture capital institutions should work together to achieve excellent investment performance. Chen et al. (2017) [8] use data from China's A-share enterprises and find that the joint investment by multiple venture institutions can bring a variety of heterogeneous resources in terms of innovative technology and industry experience, which has a stronger effect on the innovation of invested enterprises. Taking the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ) listed enterprises as a sample, Liu et al. (2018) [46] find that the joint investment composed of 5-6 venture capital institutions has the most significant impact on enterprise innovation [40]. However, some hold the opposing view that joint venture capital may also increase the cost of communication between venture capital institutions, or even increase the risk of competitive disclosure due to the sharing of venture capital information, which is not conducive to enterprise innovation. Dong et al. (2019) [47] argue that joint investment forms an indirect connection of competition among the invested enterprises, which can easily lead to competitive disclosure and hinder enterprises innovation. Considering that joint venture capital has abundant social network resources, which can help overcome the uncertainties of markets and technologies of NE industry, this paper proposes the following hypotheses:  \n\nH3. Joint venture capital is more conducive to the innovation of NEenterprises.  \n\n### 2.4. Local investment by venture capital and NE enterprises innovation  \n\nSince China's regional economic development level is varied, the distribution of venture capital institutions is imbalanced, mainly gathered in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other developed cities. From the perspective of geographical proximity, the local investment ofventure capitalinstitutions can enjoy thefinancial resources and relatively perfect intellectual property protection system brought by the process of local city's marketization, which can improve the exit performance of venture capital institutions and the innovation motivation of invested NE enterprises [48,49]. Meanwhile, in the process of local investment, geographical cluster can effectively reduce the information asymmetry of financial market, help venture capital institutions to select suitable enterprises, reduce the cost of communication and management with invested enterprises, and better provide innovative value-added services for NE enterprises, so as to gain a high reputation for investment [50]. By investigating the impact of environmental uncertainty on local investment by venture capital from the perspective of micro enterprises and macro market, Huang et al. (2015)[51]find that when the invested enterprises are high-tech enterprises, venture capital institutions are faced with higher agency costs and investment risks and are more inclined to invest in local enterprises, when the level of regional financial development is high and the atmosphere of innovation is good,venture capital is more willing to choose local investment as well. The development of NE industry has a high externality of geographical aggregation and relies on the collaborative innovation development of upstream and downstream supply chains. Venture capital investment institutions choose localization, can further narrow the scope of the innovation supply chain of NE enterprises, increase the sharing of innovative heterogeneous resources, and have a positive impact on the innovation of NE enterprises. Therefore, this paper puts forward the following hypothesis:  \n\nH4. Local investment of venture capital is more conducive to the innovation of NE enterprise.  \n\n## 3. Research design  \n\n### 3.1. Data sources  \n\nThis paper selects China's listed NE enterprises from 2010 to 2017 as the research object. The amount of venture capital obtained by NE enterprises and the specificinformation ofventure capital institutionscomesfromtheCVSourcedatabase.Totalassets,net profit, asset-liability ratio, government subsidies and age of establishment of NE enterprises are obtained from CSMAR database. Part of the missing data of government subsidies is supplemented through the annual reports oflisted enterprises and www. cninfo.com. The number of patent applications of NE enterprises comes from the State Intellectual Property Office, and some missing patent data are supplemented by the enterprise's prospectus.  \n\n### 3.2. Model setting  \n\n#### 3.2.1. PSM method  \n\nConsidering that NE enterprises with higher innovation capability may be easier to attract venture capital, and venture capital institutions may also prefer to invest in NE enterprises with higher innovation capability. This may lead to selective bias in samples, and result in the deviation of the parameter estimation results. Since the principle of PSM method is to construct the propensity score according to multi-dimensional characteristic variables,and to find the samples that are closest to the experimental group from the control group for matching, this study adopt the PSM method to process the samples, and estimates the net effect of venture capital on NE enterprises innovation by comparing the innovation difference of NE enterprises with andwithout venture capital.NE enterprises with venture capital involvement are classified into experimental group, and those without venture capital involvement are classified into control group. The Logit model is used to estimate the propensity matching score of NE enterprises to introduce venture capital. The calculation model is as follows:  \n\n$$\nP(Z_{i})=P[V C_{i}=1|Z_{i}]=\\frac{\\exp(\\beta Z_{i})}{1+\\exp(\\beta Z_{i})}\n$$  \n\nAmong them, $P(Z i)$ represents the propensity matching score of NE enterprises introducing venture capital. $V C i=1$ represents that NE enterprises have introduced venture capital, and $V C i=0$ represents that NE enterprises have not introduced venture capital. Zi represents the matching variable.  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Measurement model  \n\nBesides venture capital, the innovation of China's NE enterprises is also affected by internal factors such as enterprise size, net profit, debt ratio, enterprise's nature, and government subsidies. In order to study the impact of venture capital on the innovation of NE enterprises, the following model is constructed:  \n\n$$\np a t e n t_{i t}=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}V C_{i t}+\\sum_{k=1}^{N}\\beta_{k}C o n t r o l_{i t}+\\delta_{i}+\\varphi_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\n$$  \n\nAmong them, i represents the enterprise and t represents the year.Patent is the explained variable,which is used to measure the innovation of NE enterprises. $V C$ is the key explanatory variable, represents the amount of venture capital. Control represents all Control variables, $\\delta,\\quad\\varphi$ represents the industry and year fixed effects respectively, $\\varepsilon_{i t}$ represents the random error term.  \n\n### 3.3. Variable set  \n\nThe explained variable is the number of patent applications (patent) of NE enterprises. Compared with the R&D investment of enterprises, the number of patents can accurately measure the innovation output of enterprises, and better reflect the innovation capability of NE enterprises. Considering the hysteresis of patent authorization and the uncertainty factors in the application process, this paper finally selects the number of patent applications of NE enterprises as the explained variable [52].  \n\nThe core explanatory variable is the current venture capital stock (VC) of NE enterprises. With reference to the research of Wu (2006) [53], and Qi et al.(2017) [54], the perpetual inventory method is used here to calculate the current venture capital stock of NEenterprises:  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{V C}_{\\mathrm{t}}=\\frac{V C_{-}N_{t}}{F_{t}}+(1-\\hat{\\delta}_{t})V C_{t-1}\n$$  \n\nAmong them, $V C\\_N_{\\mathrm{{t}}}$ represents the amount of venture capital obtained by NE enterprises in the current period, $\\mathrm{F_{t}}$ represents the fixed asset investment price index of the current period, and $V C_{\\mathrm{t-1}}$ represents the venture capital stock of NE enterprises in the previousperiod. $\\delta_{t}$ represents the current depreciationrate.The variable depreciation rate of each industry to which NE enterprises belongs can be calculated through the \"CHINA INDUSTRY ECONOMY STATISTIC YEARB0OK\" (2003-2017).  \n\nEnterprise innovation may be affected by its own characteristics. According to the research of Chen et al. (2017) [8], and Qi et al. (2015) [54], six control variables of enterprise size (size), Net profit rate of total assets (roa), Asset-liability ratio (lev), Government subsidies $(s u b)$ ,Shareholder holdings (top10) and age of establishment (age) are introduced in this paper. Among them, the enterprise size (size) is represented by the logarithm of the total assets of  \n\nNE enterprise.The netprofit rate of total assets(roa)is expressed as the ratio of the enterprise's net profit to the average total assets, which measures the profitability of NE enterprise. Asset-liability ratio(lev)is expressed as the total debt to the total assets,which measures thefinancialleverageof NEenterprise.Government subsidies $(s u b)$ is represented by the logarithm of the amount of government subsidies. Shareholder holdings (top10) is expressed by the shareholding ratio of the top ten shareholders. The age of establishment (age) is expressed by the time the company was established as of 2017. The knowledge accumulation and R&D foundation of NE enterprise are related to the age of establishment.  \n\nIn order to eliminate the impact of heteroscedasticity, the stock of venture capital, enterprise size and government subsidies are added by 1 to perform logarithmic processing respectively, and roa, lev and top 10 were multiplied by 100. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the whole sample, and Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the sub-sample of NE enterprises with and without the intervention of venture capital (the experimental group and control group). Table 3 is the correlation analysis. Overall, the correlation coefficients between most variables are lower than 0.5, which means and the problem of multi-collinearity is not serious.  \n\n## 4. Empirical analysis  \n\n### 4.1. PSM empirical analysis  \n\nIn this paper, NE enterprises with venture capital intervention were classified into experimental group, and NE enterprises without venture capital intervention were classified into the control group. Excluding enterprises with a lot of missing data, 69 enterprises were finally obtained as the experimental group and 81 enterprises as the control group. First, our paper uses the nearest collar matching method for one-to-one matching. Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b show that before matching, there is a huge difference between the experimental group and the control group. After the matching, the variable characteristics of the experimental group and the control group are closer. From the variable balance table in Table 4, there are significant differences in the variables of the experimental group and the control group before the matching (U). After the matching (M), the deviations of the variables of the experimental group and the control group are within $10\\%$ and the p value is greater than 10, which show that the matching effect is perfect.  \n\n### 4.2. Innovation incentive effects of venture capital on NE enterprises  \n\nConsidering that the number of patent applications is a nonnegative discrete variable and does not meet the normal distribution required by linear regression, the Poisson model is used here to investigate the impact of venture capital on the innovation of NE enterprise. In Table 5, the model (1） examines the relationship between venture capital on the number of patent applications of NE enterprises, and the control variables were added to the model (2). Model (3) further controls the year and industry effects, and only selects the experimental group samples with the intervention of venture capital.The results show that the coefficients of venture capital amount in model (1)-(3) are 0.057, 0.010 and 0.034 respectively, and all pass the $1\\%$ significance level test. Model (4) is the whole sample of the experimental group and the control group after applying PSM model, the coefficient of venture capital is 0.010 and passes the significance test at the $1\\%$ level. For every $1\\%$ increase in the amount of venture capital, the number of patent applications of NE enterprises increases by $1\\%$ ,indicating that the venture capital has a positive and significant impact on the innovation of NE enterprise, and hypothesis H1 is established. This is consistent with the conclusions of Qi et al. (2017) [54]. New energy is a key strategic emerging industry in China. Venture capital focuses on long-term returns and can guide enterprise innovation by injecting capital into NE enterprise and providing management value-added services. Model (4) also shows that the coefficients of size and government subsidies are significantly positive (0.494 and 0.070) at the $1\\%$ level, while the coefficients of roa and top10 are significantly negative $(-0.011$ and $-0.004)$ atthe $1\\%$ level.This means that NE enterprises with larger size, higher government subsidies, declining profitability and lower equity concentration are more conducive to orderly innovation activities. Larger enterprises tend to possess abundant financial resources and innovation resources, and have stronger ability to bear innovation risks. Government subsidies can alleviate the innovation financing constraints of NE enterprises, and transmit the signal effect of strong innovation capabilities to the outside capital market. Both of which will support NE enterprises innovation.However, the stronger the profitability of NE enterprises is, the easier it is to rely on existing technologies to expand production to pursue economies of scale. If the NE enterprise's equity is over-concentrated, self-interested executives may easily be driven by interests to avoid investment in long-term and risky innovation activities. Both of them are not conducive to NE enterprises innovation. To further test the collinearity problem, the variance expandable factor (VIF) in the model (1) - model (4) is calculated. All VIF values are less than 0.5, indicating that the conclusion is not affected by multi-collinearity.  \n\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics of the whole sample.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std.Dev</td><td>Min</td><td>Max</td><td>Definiation</td></tr><tr><td>patent</td><td>1200</td><td>27.835</td><td>55.271</td><td>0</td><td>539</td><td>patentapplicationsofNEenterprises</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>1200</td><td>4.834</td><td>6.769</td><td>0</td><td>26.437</td><td>ln(1+venturecapitalstock)</td></tr><tr><td>roa</td><td>1019</td><td>3.419</td><td>5.791</td><td>-64.48</td><td>47.702</td><td>netprofit/average totalassetsx100</td></tr><tr><td>size</td><td>1019</td><td>22.343</td><td>1.357</td><td>18.92</td><td>27.079</td><td>In(total assets)</td></tr><tr><td>sub</td><td>1200</td><td>14.368</td><td>5.528</td><td>0</td><td>21.60</td><td>ln(1+governmentsubsidies)</td></tr><tr><td>lev</td><td>1019</td><td>49.270</td><td>20.58</td><td>5.911</td><td>124.99</td><td>totaldebt/totalassets×100</td></tr><tr><td>top10</td><td>1016</td><td>58.543</td><td>16.459</td><td>13.48</td><td>100</td><td>toptenshareholdingratiox100</td></tr><tr><td>age</td><td>1200</td><td>13.567</td><td>5.812</td><td>0</td><td>34</td><td>2017-establishmentyearofNEenterprises</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable2 Descriptive statistics of experimental group and control group sample.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>variables</td><td colspan=\"5\">experimental group</td><td colspan=\"5\">controlgroup</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std.Dev</td><td>Min</td><td>Max</td><td>Obs</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std.Dev</td><td>Min</td><td>Max</td></tr><tr><td>patent</td><td>552</td><td>23.28</td><td>46.472</td><td>0</td><td>376</td><td>648</td><td>31.71</td><td>61.56</td><td>0</td><td>539</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>552</td><td>10.51</td><td>6.322</td><td>0</td><td>26.44</td><td>648</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>roa</td><td>410</td><td>3.892</td><td>4.291</td><td>-16.06</td><td>24.49</td><td>609</td><td>3.101</td><td>6.596</td><td>-64.49</td><td>47.70</td></tr><tr><td>size</td><td>410</td><td>22.11</td><td>1.206</td><td>18.92</td><td>26.65</td><td>609</td><td>22.49</td><td>1.433</td><td>19.06</td><td>27.08</td></tr><tr><td>sub</td><td>552</td><td>12.85</td><td>6.762</td><td>0</td><td>20.55</td><td>648</td><td>15.66</td><td>3.748</td><td>0</td><td>21.60</td></tr><tr><td>lev</td><td>410</td><td>45.49</td><td>19.54</td><td>5.911</td><td>93.69</td><td>609</td><td>51.81</td><td>20.889</td><td>7.952</td><td>125.0</td></tr><tr><td>top10</td><td>407</td><td>59.49</td><td>14.20</td><td>28.97</td><td>100</td><td>609</td><td>57.91</td><td>17.79</td><td>13.48</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>age</td><td>552</td><td>12.54</td><td>5.496</td><td>0</td><td>28</td><td>648</td><td>14.44</td><td>5.934</td><td>0</td><td>34</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable 3 Correlation analysis.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>patent</td><td>VC</td><td>roa</td><td>size</td><td>lev</td><td>sub</td><td>top10</td><td>age</td></tr><tr><td>patent</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>0.032</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>roa</td><td>0.047</td><td>0.020</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>size</td><td>-0.039</td><td>-0.039</td><td>-0.181***</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>lev</td><td>-0.062**</td><td>-0.149***</td><td>-0.480***</td><td>0.529***</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>sub</td><td>0.171***</td><td>0.035</td><td>-0.0682</td><td>0.513***</td><td>0.253***</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>top10</td><td>0.004</td><td>-0.021</td><td>0.270***</td><td>0.076**</td><td>-0.216***</td><td>0.0121</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>age</td><td>-0.087***</td><td>-0.016</td><td>-0.143***</td><td>0.311***</td><td>0.267***</td><td>0.132***</td><td>-0.205***</td><td>1</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n![](images/e3275548b634a5492f9a1548ac49b442f81daf6c342417148f6c2b14ed14874e.jpg)  \nFig. 1. a).

Innovation incentive effects of different types of venture capital sourcesonNEenterprises  \n\nAccording to whether the venture capital institution has a government background, the whole NE enterprises have been divided into a government participation group and a nongovernment participation group. In Table 6, models (1) and (2) show that the coefficient of venture capital in government participation sample group is 0.031 and passes the significance test at the $1\\%$ level, while the coefficient of the non-government participation sample group is 0.oo7 but insignificant. For every $1\\%$ increase in the amount of government venture capital, the corresponding NE enterprise patent applications increase by $3.1\\%$ indicatingthat compared with venture capital without government background, government participation venture capital has a more significant incentive effect on innovation of NE enterprises, and hypothesis H2 is established. This is in line with the conclusions of He (2019) [55]. Taking China's 569 GEM listed enterprises as samples, He (2019) also confirm that the innovation effect of government venture capital on enterprises is better than that of non-government venture capital [55]. A possible explanation is that government participation venture capital is more willing to attract private capital and provide abundant financial support for the innovation of NE enterprises. In addition, improving technological capability is the core strategic goal of the development of China's NE industry at the present stage, government participation venture capital is policy-guided and is easily affected by the innovation strategy of the NE industry, so it pays more efforts to promote the innovation capability oftheNEenterprises.  \n\nIn model (3) and model (4), the coefficient of venture capital in the joint venture capital group is 0.040 and passes the significance test at the $1\\%$ level. When the amount of joint venture capital increasesby $1\\%$ . the number of patent applications of NE enterprises increasesby $4\\%$ . The coefficient of the independent venture capital groupis $-0.006$ but insignificant, indicating that compared with the independent venture capital, the joint venture capital has a more significant promoting effect on the innovation of NE enterprises. It is assumed that H3 is valid and is similar to the findings of Wen and Feng (2018) [56]. From the perspective of \"value-added\" and \"exploitation\", Wen and Feng (2018) find that joint venture capital can significantly stimulate enterprise innovation through providing value-added management services, while single venture capital tends to impede innovation for its expropriation behavior [56]. New energy is the key industry supported by Chinese government with high uncertainties of technology and market. Joint venture capital can bring diversified resources to NE enterprises and reduce innovation constraints caused by financing difficulties and talent shortages. Meanwhile, joint venture capital can provide a more complete social cooperation network to form a good strategic partnership between the invested NE enterprises, and therefore produce synergistic innovation effects.  \n\nBy manually inquiring the headquarters and office addresses of each venture capital institution and NE enterprises, the division of whether venture capital institutions invest locally is conducted.If venture capital institution and invested NE enterprise is located in the same province (autonomous region, municipality), it is defined as a local investment (model (5). Otherwise, it is a non-local investment (model (6)). In model (5) and model (6), the coefficients of venture capital in local investment group and non-local investment group are 0.049 and 0.012,both of which passes the significance test at the $1\\%$ level. For every $1\\%$ increase in the amount of localventure capital investment, the number of patent applications for NE enterprises will increase by $4.9\\%$ and for every $1\\%$ increase in the amount of non-local investment, the corresponding patents will increase by $1.2\\%$ indicating that thelocal investment of venture capital institutions has a more significant effect on promoting the innovation of NE enterprises. It is assumed that H4 is established.  \n\nTable6 Innovation incentive effects of different types of venture capital sources on NE enterprises.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>governmentparticipation</td><td>Non-government participation</td><td>Jointventure capital</td><td>Independentventure capital</td><td>Localinvestment</td><td>Non-localinvestment</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">VC</td><td>0.031***</td><td>0.007</td><td>0.040***</td><td>-0.006</td><td>0.049***</td><td>0.012***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.006)</td><td>(0.003)</td><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.005)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.052***</td><td>0.045***</td><td>0.022***</td><td>-0.014</td><td>0.057***</td><td>-0.038***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">roa size</td><td>(0.007)</td><td>(0.007)</td><td>(0.005)</td><td>(0.015)</td><td>(0.007)</td><td>(0.007)</td></tr><tr><td>0.367***</td><td>-0.032</td><td>-0.180***</td><td>1.388***</td><td>-0.092*</td><td>0.855***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">lev</td><td>(0.081)</td><td>(0.059)</td><td>(0.047)</td><td>(0.158)</td><td>(0.048)</td><td>(0.102)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.010***</td><td>0.004**</td><td>0.007***</td><td>-0.001</td><td>0.008***</td><td>0.005*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">sub</td><td>(0.003)</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.002)</td></tr><tr><td>0.022</td><td>0.087***</td><td>0.077***</td><td>-0.007</td><td>0.031**</td><td>0.138***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">top10</td><td>(0.017)</td><td>(0.019)</td><td>(0.013)</td><td>(0.039)</td><td>(0.015)</td><td>(0.026)</td></tr><tr><td>0.008***</td><td>-0.028***</td><td>-0.021***</td><td>-0.007</td><td>-0.013***</td><td>-0.002</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">age</td><td>(0.003)</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.005)</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.004)</td></tr><tr><td>0.083</td><td>0.059</td><td>0.104***</td><td>-0.334***</td><td>0.114***</td><td>-0.035</td></tr><tr><td>(0.076)</td><td></td><td>(0.047)</td><td>(0.037)</td><td>(0.123)</td><td>(0.042)</td><td>(0.083)</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Industry YES</td><td></td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">cons</td><td>-5.572***</td><td>2.645**</td><td>6.165***</td><td>-25.310***</td><td>3.873***</td><td>-17.224***</td></tr><tr><td>(1.947)</td><td>(1.273)</td><td>(1.097)</td><td>(3.237)</td><td>(1.143)</td><td>(2.261)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Inalpha</td><td>0.423*</td><td>0.175</td><td>-0.220</td><td>0.218</td><td>-0.248</td><td>0.381</td></tr><tr><td>(0.245)</td><td>(0.221)</td><td>(0.202)</td><td>(0.295)</td><td>(0.226)</td><td>(0.243)</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>185</td><td>213</td><td>272</td><td>126</td><td>214</td><td>184</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: $***$ $^{**}$ and $^*$ denote significant at 1%, $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ level respectively, the numbers in brackets are robust standard deviations.  \n\nThis finding is similar to that of Zhang (2019) [57], where the intraprovincial investment by venture capital institutions is a greater facilitator of enterprise innovation than cross-provincial investment when enterprise innovation is measured by patents, while cross-provincial investment is a greater facilitator when enterprise innovation is measured by trademarks. A possible reason may be that localization investment of venture capital institutions may alleviate the information asymmetry between venture capital institutions and NE enterprises and bring heterogeneous innovation resources for NE enterprises, which is more conducive to innovation of NE enterprises.  \n\n### 4.4.Innovation incentive effects of local investment by government participationventure capital and local investment byjoint venture capital onNEenterprises  \n\nIn practice, compared with non-government participation venture capital, government participation venture capital is mostly set up by local governments and prefers to implement local investment. Meanwhile, compared with independent venture capital, joint venture capital institutions implement local investment can leverage social networks and integratelocal resourcesfor enterprises innovation. Therefore, this paper further analyzes the impact of local investment by government participation venture capital and local investment by joint venture capital on the innovation of NE enterprises. We firstly select all samples of local investment made by venture capital, and then group them separately by two different classification criteria: government and non-government participation, joint and independent. In Table 7, the coefficient of local investment by government participation venture capital in model (1) is 0.058 and the coefficient of local investment by nongovernment participation venture capital in model (2) is 0.040, both of which are all significant at the $1\\%$ level. The results show that local investment of government participation venture capital plays a more significant role in promoting the innovation of NE enterprises,for every $1\\%$ increase in the amount of local government venture capital investment, the number of patent applications for invested NE enterprises increases by $5.8\\%$ .Thisis consistent with previous studies. Dong et al.(2019)[47]believes that government-sponsored venture capital is more inclined to make localized investment and has a better innovation effect on local enterprises than private venture capital. Tian et al. (2020) [58] also argues that with the increase of geographical distance, the impact of venture capital on enterprise innovation becomes smaller, and the innovation effect of government venture capital in a short distance is more significant. Since government participation venture capital is mostly set up by local governments with the policy goal of supporting local enterprises to innovate and start businesses, and NE enterprises are the key industries strongly supported by regional governments, local investment of government participation venture capital may provide NE enterprises with moreinnovationfunds and better guidancewith thecharacteristics of policy convenience and communication effectiveness than the local investment by non-government participation venturecapital.  \n\nThe coefficient of local investment by joint venture capital in model (3) is 0.051 and passes the significance test at the $1\\%$ level, the coefficient of local investment by independent venture capital in model (4) is 0.029 and is significant at the $5\\%$ level, indicating that local investment by joint venture capital plays a stronger role in promoting the innovation of NE enterprises. For every $1\\%$ increase in the amount of local investment by joint venture capital, the number of patent applications for invested NE enterprises increasesby $5.1\\%$ Joint investmenthas becomea new trend for venture capital institutions to effectively avoid investment risks and promote investment success [59]. Li et al.(2021) [60] believe that in order to eliminate the agency costs and investment barriers, choosing to cooperate with local venture capital institutions can improve the listing and performance of the invested enterprises. The innovation of NE industry relies on the collaborative innovation development of upstream and downstream supply chains. Local investment by joint venture capital can realize the connection of the network relationship of different venture capital institutions, acceleratetheintegration oflocalinnovationresources,andfurther reduce the scope of the innovation supply chain of NE enterprises. At the same time, local investment by joint venture capital have rich industry experience, and may promote the process of sharing heterogeneous innovation resources among native invested enterprises and stimulate the innovation of NE enterprises.  \n\nTable7 Innovation incentive effects of local investment by government participation venture capital and local investment by joint venture capital   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>Localinvestmentbygovernment venture capital</td><td>Localinvestmentbynon-government venturecapital</td><td>capital</td><td>Local investment by joint venture Local investment by independent venture capital</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">VC</td><td>0.058***</td><td>0.040***</td><td>0.051***</td><td>0.029**</td></tr><tr><td>(0.005)</td><td>(0.010)</td><td>(0.005)</td><td>(0.013)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">roa</td><td>0.038***</td><td>0.074***</td><td>0.067***</td><td>-0.029</td></tr><tr><td>(0.012)</td><td>(0.011)</td><td>(0.008)</td><td>(0.021)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">size</td><td>-1.200***</td><td>-0.270***</td><td>-0.299***</td><td>0.915***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.117) 0.026***</td><td>(0.075) 0.010***</td><td>(0.057) 0.003</td><td>(0.230)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">lev</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.027***</td></tr><tr><td>(0.004) 0.044**</td><td>(0.003) 0.014</td><td>(0.002) 0.008</td><td>(0.008)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">sub</td><td>(0.021)</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.011</td></tr><tr><td>0.045***</td><td>(0.024) -0.036***</td><td>(0.015) -0.016***</td><td>(0.057) 0.028**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">top10</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.003)</td><td>(0.002)</td><td>(0.013)</td></tr><tr><td>0.138***</td><td>0.172**</td><td>0.138***</td><td>-0.102</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">age Year</td><td>(0.050)</td><td>(0.067)</td><td>(0.044)</td><td>(0.237)</td></tr><tr><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Industry YES</td><td></td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>21.898***</td><td>8.019***</td><td>8.824***</td><td>-18.515***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">cons lnalpha</td><td>(2.491)</td><td>(1.743)</td><td>(1.299)</td><td>(5.012)</td></tr><tr><td>-0.596*</td><td>-0.338</td><td>-0.386</td><td>0.223</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">N</td><td>(0.355)</td><td>(0.312)</td><td>(0.268)</td><td>(0.422)</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>103</td><td>164</td><td>50</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote:\\*\\*\\*, $^{**}$ and $^*$ denote significant at $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ level respectively, the numbers in brackets are robust standard deviations.  \n\n## 5. Robustness test  \n\nIn order to ensure the consistency of the research conclusions, this paper conducts robustness tests in the following ways: (1) Replace explanatory variables. Selecting the R&D investment of NE enterprises as a measure of innovation, (2) Treating the independent variable with a lag period, (3) Removing the samples all patent application number is 0, (4) The domestic venture capital industry has developed rapidly after 2012, so the samples before 2012 are excluded.

Conclusions and recommendations  \n\nThis paper selects listed NE enterprises from 2010 to 2017 as a research sample, examines the impact of venture capital on the innovation of NE enterprises, and draws the following main conclusions. First, venture capital, as a new type of market-oriented financing method, can significantly promote the innovation of NE enterprises, which is manifested in the significant increase in the number of patent applications for NE enterprises. And, NE enterprises with larger size, higher government subsidies, declining profitability and lower equity concentration may also conducive to enterprises innovation. Second, compared with non-government participation, independent venture capital and non-localized investment of venture capital, government participation venture capital, joint venture capital and venture capital localized investment are more conducive to the innovation of NE enterprises. Third, government participation venture capital for localized investment and joint venture capital for localized investment have a more significant role in promoting the innovation of NE enterprises. Based on the above conclusions, this paper proposes the following policyrecommendations:  \n\nFirst of all, under the background of gradual withdrawal of government subsidies, China needs to adopt credit incentives policies to vigorously promote the development of venture capital industry and form a market-based mechanism for venture capital to support the development of the NE industry. On this basis, give full play to the \"incubation\" role of venture capital to promote the innovation of NE industry. Secondly, new energy is a strategic emerging industry. It is necessary to make full use of the policy orientation and capital scale advantages of government participation venture capital to promote technological innovation of NE enterprises and thus improve the technological competitiveness of the NE industry. Third, as NE's technology and market are highly uncertain, the government should encourage venture capital institutions to choose joint investment to support the development of NE enterprises and avoid investment risks. Realize the innovation of NE enterprises by providing abundant talents, funds and more complete social network resources. Finally, the government should also encourage government participation and joint venture capital to accelerate the regional financial development of science and technology through local investment, and give full play to the innovation synergies produced by industrial agglomeration.  \n\nThis paper has the following deficiencies. (1) Since unlisted enterprises are not required to publish data,the samples used in this paper are all listed NE enterprises, and the data obtained from foreign venture capital investment in NE enterprises are very few. Therefore, we classify foreign venture capital and private venture capital as non-government venture capital, and cannot provide foreign venture capital and private venture capital separately. In future research, the impact of venture capital with different ownership characteristics on China's strategic NE industry should be enriched when sufficient data are available. (2) In terms of research methods, this paper applies Poisson regression to investigate the impact of venture capital on the innovation of NE enterprises.Since the use of quantile-to-quantile regression can investigate the effects of different combinations of independent variables on the dependent variable[61],to fully explore the complex effects of differentlevels ofventurecapital amounts on the different levels of innovation capability of NE enterprises, the quantile-to-quantile regression method should be adopted in the subsequent studies.  \n\n# Author contributions  \n\nJIANG Cailou: Conceptualization, Writing - review & editing, LIU DeHai: Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft.  \n\n# Declaration of competing interest  \n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.  \n\n# Acknowledgments  \n\nFinancial support from the National Social Science Foundation of China (20BGL046).  \n\n# References  \n\n[1]  Gaddy BE, Sivaram V, Jones TB, Wayman L.

In this paper, we attempt to answer this question using a unique dataset of the gender of venture capital partners’ children. First, we find strong evidence that parenting more daughters leads to an increased propensity to hire female partners by venture capital firms. Second, using an instrumental variable set-up, we also show that improved gender diversity, induced by parenting more daughters, improves deal and fund performances. These effects concentrate Overwhelmingly on the daughters of senior partners than junior partners. Taken together, our findings have profound implications on how the capital markets could function better with improved diversity.  \n\nJEL classification: [To be updated: G02, G24, G30, L14, L20.]  \n\n## Contents  \n\n1.

Introduction  \n\nHomophily-driven biases can be a powerful force that inhibits diversity in organizations. To overcome these barriers, policymakers have often attempted to actively promote diversity in the workplace. Whether politicians or senior executives, many of the measures that are adopted assume that greater diversity naturally leads to better performance. Others are skeptical that there is a measurable improvement in performance when diversity is mandated. Most of the research on whether or not greater diversity leads to improvements in the performance of organizations has been hampered by the inability to identify exogenous variation in diversity that is needed for causal inferences about the implications of diversity on performance. Still, other work has been done in artificial settings outside of a real business context in which true long-run profit motives would be present. Our paper makes two important contributions to the literature on diversity by using a novel experimental design. First, we show that subtle treatment effects (e.g, parenting daughters) can reduce hiring biases against women. Second, we show that exogenous shocks to gender diversity lead to economic and statistically significant increases in performance.  \n\nWe look at venture capital firms and leverage the exogenously induced increases in gender diversity. Through unique data, we are able to identify hiring events for senior investment professionals at venture capital firms. Gompers and Wang (2017) show that only about $10\\%$ ofnew hires in the venture capital industry are women. Prior work by Gompers, Muhkarlyamov, Weisburst, and Xuan (2017) has shown that approximately $75\\%$ of venture capital firms have never had a senior investment professional who is a woman. Our experimental design is to gather data on the gender of venture capitalists’ children. We show that when existing partners have more daughters, the probability of hiring a senior female investor is significantly increased. Because the gender of one's children is usually thought to be exogenous, the gender diversity induced by hiring a senior female investor can be used to estimate the causal effect of gender diversity on performance. We examine both deal level outcomes as well as fund level excess returns and find that greater gender diversity increases performance by a meaningful amount. The results are robust to various measures of the relative ratio of daughters to total children. Importantly, the results for hiring women and its effect on performance only exist for information on senior partners? children. This makes sense if the senior partners are those who make the hiring decisions in the firm.  \n\nOur results highlight two important effects. The first is that subtle treatment effects can Overcome the influence of homophily. The demographic patterns and trends surveyed in Gompers and Wang (2017) highlight the overall lack of gender diversity in venture capital. Women have entered into venture capital at rates much lower than their entry rates into other highly compensated professional fields such as medicine or law. The representation of women in science and technology advanced degrees and MBAs (as a precursor to entry into venture capital) are much higher than the representation of women in the innovation sector. Also, the relative percentage of venture capitalists who are female has not increased measurably over the past twenty-five years. Gompers and Wang point out that the most likely explanation for this persistently low representation of female investors is related to the notion of homophily, which is the tendency of individuals to associate with similar others.  \n\nAs surveyed in McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook (2001), the notion that “similarity breeds connection” has robust and profound effects in network structures of every type, including \"marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, co-membership, and other types of relationship.\" Positive assortative mating along observable inheritable traits (e.g., intelligence, race, and height) discussed by Becker (1973) in the context of a marriage market can be viewed as the micro foundation of homophily in which choosing a partner with similar characteristics increases the certainty about the quality of one's offspring.  Currarini et al. (2009) provide theoretical foundations for the pattern of homophily in social networks using a search-based model of friendship formation and conclude that biases towards same types in both individual preferences and the matching processes affect pairing outcomes.  \n\nA direct implication of this “birds of a feather’ phenomenon is that venture capitalists prefer to hire, invest in, or coinvest with those that are similar to themselves in characteristics such as gender and ethnicity. Indeed, Gompers, Mukharlyamov, and Xuan (2016) show that coinvestment patterns in venture capital are driven by social similarities, where venture capitalists who are more similar in terms of gender, ethnicity, school background, and work history are more likely to collaborate. Further, they also show that this homophily driven collaboration reduces performance.'  \n\nMoreover, the typical venture capital firm is small in size, with a median of three partners in our dataset. Hiring decisions are made infrequently. Most venture capital firms only make infrequent senior hires, e.g, perhaps once every three to five years. Thus, aggregate new hiring in this industry is driven by the (aggregated) decisions of small teams. From social psychology, small groups are both more likely to be homophilous, and more likely to have biases aggregated into expressed decision-making (Klocke (2007). Thus, a slight - even subconscious - preference over certain demographic characteristics, like gender, could aggregate into a sustained overall lack of gender diversity at an industy level. A very slight gender preference due to homophily may result in the hiring of a man over a woman. Even though the gender preference can be thought of as a continuous variable and any slight bias could be small the hiring outcome is binary. In this setting, even a very small bias towards hiring someone of the same gender could lead to persistent low representation from those groups not already in the venture capital industry. The aggregation of such binary outcomes across firms can result in the overall lack of diversity across an entire industry.  \n\nOne question is whether subtle treatment effects can dislodge the inherent homophilic preferences that venture capitalists have when hiring a new senior partner. Recent work has found that parenting can influence social preferences. For example, Warner (1991) showed in surveys that parents of daughter tended to show greater support for feminist causes. Similarly, Warner and Steel (1999) show that fathers of daughters show greater support for gender equity than do fathers of sons. Recent works have also shown that decision making of fathers can be influenced by the gender of their children. Washington (2008) has shown that US Congressmen vote more liberally, especially on issues affecting women, if they have more daughters. Crongquist (2015) shows that CEOs who have more daughters are more likely to adopt sociall responsible corporate policies. Glynn and Sen (2015) show that Federal Court judges with more daughters tend to decide cases on women's issues more liberally and that the effect is largely driven by Republican judges.  \n\nOur results show that these types of subtle treatment effects have real consequences for business decisions. We find that the proportion of female hires increases by $1.93\\%$ if you replace a son with a daughter for the existing partners in a firm. Given that about $8.03\\%$ of the new hires are female, this suggests a $24\\%$ increase in the probability of hiring a senior female investor when a son is replaced with a daughter for the existing partners.  \n\nOur second important result concerns the effect of diversity on firm performance. Despite growing evidence that people do indeed tend to partner with similar individuals, the success implications of this bias remain unclear. To put it another way, conclusive causal evidence that increases in gender diversity lead to better performance in a business setting is lacking. Sociologybased research has tended to look at ex post data and measure correlations with performance.  \n\nResults on gender diversity have, by and large, been equivocal. Furthermore, the setting does not allow for causal interpretations of results. Still, other papers have looked at experimental settings and assigned members based on gender to various “team-based\" projects. This work, however, tells us little about whether or not the kinds of complex problems in business are affected by diversity.  \n\nTheory also does not help when trying to understand whether firm diversity increases or decreases performance. One conjecture is that the more characteristics a pair of individuals has in common, the better the performance of the team is likely to demonstrate. This better performance may result from easier communication, the ability to better convey tacit information, or the ability to make joint decisions in a timely and productive manner (e.g., Ingram and Roberts, 2000; McPherson et al., 2001; Cohen et al., 2008; Gompers and Xuan, 2010).  \n\nOn the other hand, however, homophily may induce social conformity and groupthink that may lead to inefficient decision making (e.g., Asch, 1951; Janis, 1982; Ishi and Xuan, 2010). Individuals in homophilic relationships often have an enhanced desire for unanimity and ignore, or insufficiently consider, the disadvantages of the favored decision as well as the advice from experts outside the group. Consequently, under an alternative hypothesis, more diverse firms might perform better because decision-making under uncertainty is improved.  \n\nOur empirical setting allows us to estimate the causal implications of diversity on investment performance in venture capital. Because the gender of a venture capitalists? children is exogenous, we can utilize the relative fraction of daughters (to all children) as an instrument for changes in the gender diversity of the firm (caused by hiring a senior female investor.) This setting allows us to look at the exogenous component of gender diversity in venture capital and its effect on investment performance. Our results are robust to a number of ways to characterize the gender make-up of children as well as to measuring individual deal level performance (success) or fund level excess returns (relative to similar strategy venture capital funds raised in the same year.) The results are both statistically significant and economically meaningful.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses our data. Our methodological approach is outlined in section 3. Section 4 presents a discussion of our results, both the hiring level regressions as well as the performance results. Section 5 concludes.  \n\n### 2. Data Collection  \n\nThe core data used in this paper is comprised of several parts. The first element of our data involves collecting a comprehensive dataset all venture capital partners as well as their demographic and family information. The second element involves a panel dataset of venture capital firm hiring events. The final elemnt part is on collecting the deal and fund performances.  \n\nWe start with VentureSource, a database that contains detailed information on venture capital investments. Our data cover the period from 1990 through mid-2016. We start our analysis in 1990 because the data become reasonably comprehensive at that point in time. The unit of observation in the data is venture capital-backed companies. For each portfolio company, we have the identities of the individuals involved with the firm including founders, venture capital investors, angel investors, board members, and early hires. We focus on the venture capitalists on the board of directors. Venture capitalists who never serve on a board will not be identified in our data. We believe this is reasonable because most venture capitalists serve on the board of directors for companies for which they are the lead investor. Similarly, most venture capitalists highlight their active involvement in their portfolio companies via board representation. In addition to information about the people involved in the company, we also have information on the portfolio company's location and industry. A venture capitalist enters the data in the year they make their first investment for which they sit on the board of directors.  \n\nFor each individual venture capitalist in the dataset, we collect a broad range of biographical information such as gender, ethnicity, education, and prior job experience. We collect this information from a variety of sources, including a leading online resume website, web searches, SEC filings and news articles. In particular, venture capitalist genders are primarily determined based on first names. In the cases of unisex names, we determine gender by reading news articles and web pages mentioning or containing pictures of the individual. Our overall match rates for gender exceeds $99\\%$ .A full detailed summary of the data are presented in Gompers and Wang (2017).  \n\nOur empirical approach is to focus on the effects of children's gender on the hiring choices of venture capital firms and how exogenous changes in gender diversity associated with children's gender affects venture capital investment outcomes. We therefore set out to collect a novel dataset on the family information of venture capital partners, including the number of children as well as the gender and age of each child. Summarized in Table I Panel B, we obtain information from a total of 1,403 individuals from various sources including college and business school directories and reunion books $(61.7\\%)$ , direct email solicitation $(33.9\\%)$ , and Marquis Who's Who database $(3.5\\%)$ . For email solicitation, we sent out over 3000 emails and obtained 476 responses. If we do not obtain a child's gender explicitly but have the child's name, we assign a best-guess gender based on the first name. Overall, we are able to identify gender for over $98\\%$ of venture capital partners children in our data.  \n\nPanel A of Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for our data on children. Venture capital partners in our data set have on average 2.39 children and 1.15 daughters as of 2015. For $71.6\\%$ Of the children we obtain their exact ages as well, which is used to approximate the children measures for prior years. In the firm panel data, Table VI shows that the average number of daughters for existing partners is 1.033, while the average number of sons is 1.084 in the sample. Senior partners, defined as those who have a tenure of 5 years or more at the venture capital firm, have on average 1.086 daughters and 1.143 sons. In comparison, junior partners, defined as those whose tenure is less than 5 years, have fewer children than the senior partners as expected, averaging 0.809 daughters and 0.850 sons.2  \n\nAlso shown in Table I, $10.19\\%$ of our sample are women (slightly higher than the population average in Gompers and Wang (2017) and have made 5.29 investments on whose boards they have served.? To ensure that our analysis is based on people who are professional venture capitalists, our main analysis focuses on those who have made at least three investments on whose boards they have served.  \n\nIn constructing our sample, as long as we have children information on at least one partner from a given firm, we include that firm in our sample. We do not believe that this creates issues for our resuls because the partners that we obtained information are typically those who are more senior and have an important role in making hiring decisions. Simiarly, there should be no bias from using all firms for which we have children's gender for at least one partner. Table Il compares the characteristics of the firms in our sample with those for whom we have no data on children. In particular, our sample includes firms that have more partners (5.03 vs. 1.95), larger in the total amount raised $\\$3.66$ billion vs. $\\$0.88$ billion), and more likely to be US-based ( $85\\%$ Vs. $65\\%$ Although this sample is not representative by any means, they do hire similar proportions of women (0.08 vs. 0.09). Economically, we believe that this is a relevant sample because these firms make disproportionately more deals (76.5 vs. 8.9) and hire more people (12.8 vs. 3.3). The empirical results from this group of firms are of great economic importance given they represent a large fraction of all deals done. Additionally, this selection is unlikely affected by the gender break-down of the children, which is also what we need for a meaningful interpretation of the empirical results.  \n\nNext, we construct a panel of gender breakdowns for each firm's new hires, which allows us to test whether the gender of an existing partner's children can have an effect on the hiring of women. While we do not directly observe exactly when a particular VC partner is hired by a firm, we estimate the “hiring\"’ event by recording the year in which the person first sat on the board of a venture capital-backed company and represented the particular venture capital firm. Overall, we can see from Table VI that VC firms in our sample make 4.58 new hires on average in any 5-year window and only $8.03\\%$ of the new hires are women.  \n\nTable III shows that $72.1\\%$ of firms have never had a female investor. $19.2\\%$ have hired exactly one female investor. We also see that there is a general relationship between firm size and the number of female investors hired. In Table IV we examine the ratio of female hiring based upon firm size. We find that small firms with fewer than 5 partners have an average female hiring ratio of $5.29\\%$ , whereas large firms with greater than 11 partners have a much higher female hiring ratio of $10.18\\%$ . The general pattern of very low female hiring ratios is consistent with the results of Gompers and Wang (2017) who show that homophily may be particularly strong in influencing hiring decisions at small organizations.  \n\nTable V tabulates the ratio of new hires who are women by industry and over various time periods. Hiring by industry is defined by the industry of the first company on whose board the venture investor sits. We see that there is little relative variation across different industries. Healthcare has the highest percentage of female hires at $11.6\\%$ .Most of the other industries are between $7.7\\%$ and $9.0\\%$ . In the bottom of Table V we look at the ratio of female hires across fiveyear cohorts. The lowest percentage of female hires is for 1991-1995. A period of time during which only $3.54\\%$ of new hires were female investors. From 1996 through 2016, the fraction of new hires who are women has not shown any secular trend. It has varied between $7.6\\%$ and $9.4\\%$  \n\nLastly, we also compile a comprehensive dataset of venture firm performances, which allows us to estimate the impact of both parenting daughters and improved gender diversity on economic outcomes. At the deal level, in Table VI, we see that out of 11,832 deals, $14.17\\%$ of them resulted in an IPO. Alternatively, if we complement the definition of “success\"” with deals whose acquisition values are greater than the total amount of capital invested, the overall success rate is $28.7\\%$ We obtain acquisition values from Capital IQ when available. If we are unable to identify an acquisition value, we do not consider the investment a success.  \n\nBecause both “IPO\" and “success\"” are binary outcome measures that may fail to capture the economic magnitude of the outcome, we also compile fund-level internal rates of return (IRR) by matching each of the venture capital funds in our data to the Preqin database. Over the relevant time period of our analysis, our venture capital firms raised 1,270 venture capital funds with an average amount of capital raised of $\\$515.1$ million. We are able to identify fund level IRR information for 395 funds with Preqin data. The average net IRR of funds in our sample is $14.1\\%$ .We also compare our fund returns to benchmarks that are matched by investment stage and year. Excess returns above these benchmarks average $3.9\\%$ for funds in our sample. Similar to the summary results for firm size and age, our sample skews towards more successful firms.  \n\n### 3. Methodology  \n\nThe work of Gompers, Mukharlyamov, and Xuan (2016) and Gompers and Wang (2017) show that homophily is a strong force that affects collaboration and hiring decisions in the venture capital industry. Our empirical approach is to examine whether subtle treatment effects may “de-bias\" venture capital hiring decisions. From the work of Warner and Steel (1999) and Washington (2008), we know that the gender of one's children affects parental behavior in the political arena. Politicians with more daughters are more likely to support feminist policies and women's issues relative to other issues. In this paper, we examine whether the same type of debiasing affects hiring decisions in venture capital. Also, because the gender of one's children is exogenous, we can use children's gender as an instrument for exogenous changes to venture capital firm gender diversity and, hence, can identify the causal effects of exogenous shocks to diversity on firm performance.  \n\nThe thought experiment is as follows: A venture capital partner decides to have a child; nature randomly assigns the gender of the child. Importantly, our empirical set-up conditions on the total number of children, while estimating the relative effect of having a daughter vs. a son, which we will refer to as the “daughter effect'\" in this paper.  \n\n$$\nY_{i,t}=\\beta_{1}\\#{D a u g h t e r s_{i,t}}+\\beta_{2}\\#{C h i l d r e n_{i,t}}+{C o n t r o l s_{i,t}}+\\epsilon_{i,t}\n$$  \n\nHere, the $Y$ variable is the “female hired ratio\", which is defined as the proportion of female partner hires by firm $i$ within the five-year window ending in year t. Whether a particular firm-year observation is included in our sample is determined by whether the venture capital firm raised a fund that year. This sample construction method attempts to capture the more active years while also reducing over-lapping time windows, since an average firm launches 3.3 funds in our sample.  \n\nOverall, we have 988 fund observations where we include 301 VC firms with funds raised through 2010.4  \n\nOn the right-hand side of equation (1), “number of daughters\"”’ and “number of children” refer to the average number of daughters or children among the existing partners of the firm. For a given observation at the fund level, we define “existing partners” as those who are present in the firm when the fund was raised. This measure of existing partner is constructed to capture the likely decision makers in the hiring process.  \n\nIn alternative specifications, we also consider other measures of children's gender breakdown, including the average ratio of daughters, the proportion of partners who have more daughters than sons, as well as the proportion of partners who have at least one daughter. All results are robust to these alternative specifications for the gender make-up of the existing partners’ children. Additionally, we include control variables for firm size (approximated by partner count), the VC firm age, the average existing partners age, a dummy for whether the firm has hired a female investor before, and year fixed effect.  \n\nThere are a number of issues in interpreting the identification here. First, $\\beta_{1}$ identifies the relative effect of having an additional daughter as compared to an additional son. It is important that we condition on the total number of children because we know that people who choose to have more children are more likely to have conservative beliefs (Washington, 2008). However, once we condition on the total number of children, the gender distribution can be more reliably thought of as a random variable uncorrelated with the error. Additionally, since the total number of children, the number of daughters, and the number of sons are linearly dependent, we cannot differentiate whether the VC behavior is related to parenting a daughter, not parenting a son, or a combination of both.  \n\nThe important identifying assumption is that conditioning on the total number of children, the number of daughters is exogenously assigned by nature. This requires that parents are not giving birth to children using a gender-based stopping rule, or practicing any type of direct sex-selection. It is this natural experiment setting that allows us to identify a causal relationship between the relative number of daughters and the female hired ratio as well as the effects of this exogenously induced gender diversity on venture capital performance.  \n\nWe first rule out sex-selection that may skew the sex ratio. Given that direct sex selection through abortions is uncommon in the US, it is not surprising that we find that male-to-female ratio in our sample of children is not statistically different from the natural male-to-female birth ratio in the Overall population. This is true if we condition on the total number of children, or if we examine various subgroups, namely the senior partners, the junior partners, the male partners, and the female partners. In fact, being able to recover the natural sex birth ratio in all subsamples gives us confidence in the integrity of our data. As such, we do not find evidence of sex selection in our data.  \n\nNext, we want to rule out gender-based stopping rules. If parents employ a gender-based stopping rule which stipulates that they keep having children until they have at least one son, then conditioning on the total number of children, those who have more daughters would be more likely to be using such a stopping rule.  \n\nTo provide support for this identifying assumption, we run a number of tests. In particular, we find that having a first-born daughter does not predict the total number of children, consistent with the findings in Washington (2008). We tabulate these results in Online Appendix Table I. Further, we also do not find statistical evidence of gender-stopping rules by testing whether the gender distribution is different from that of a binomial distribution with the natural sex birth rates conditioning on the total number of children. As such, the gender of the partners’ children in our sample is considered truly random, and hence uncorrelated with the error. Our estimation of the form in Equation (1) can then identify the impact of the children's gender on female hiring.  \n\nIn addition to examining the effects of children's gender on hiring decisions, we use the exogenous effect of children's gender on the hiring decision to examine the causal effect of diversity on venture capital investment performance. We examine the performance effects in two ways. First, we simply look at the reduced form regression results, i.e., we examine a simple performance regression where deal or fund level performance is on the left-hand side and a variety of controls are on the right-hand side including data on the gender of existing partners? children. Since we measure firm outcomes both at the deal level and the fund level, we simply need to adjust Equation (1) so that the deal-level or fund-level characteristics are correctly matched to firm-level characteristics or controls.  \n\nOur second set of performance results exploits the exogenous nature of a venture capitalist partners′ children's genders and use the “number of daughters” as an instrument for the “female hired ratio.” In this instrumental variables framework, we look at the performance effect of the exogenous component of gender diversity for a venture capital firm that is associated with the gender of existing partners’ children. Our measure of a shock to the firm's gender diversity is the female hired ratio.  \n\nFemale Hired Rat ${}_{;i o_{i,t}}=\\beta_{1}$ #Daughtersi,t + β2 #Childreni,t + Controlsi,t + Ei,t  \n\nFirm Performand $\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}\\boldsymbol{e}_{i,t}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{1}$ Predicted Female Hired Ratic $\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\rho}}_{i,t}+\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\rho}}_{2}$ #Childreni,t + Controlsi,t + Wi,t  \n\nIn this set-up, we can causally infer the effect of gender diversity on performance in venture capital. As discussed above, we run a variety of robustness checks throughout the results to ensure that our findings are not sensitive to the measure of the prevalence of daughters or measuring the gender diversity of the venture capital firms. Many of these robustness tests are included in an Online appendix.  \n\n### 4. Empirical Results  \n\nIn this section, we present our empirical findings. We first analyze the causal relationship between the gender of existing partners? children and the hiring of female investment partners. Then, we analyze the reduced-form relationship between the gender of existing partners’ children and investment performances. Finally, we analyze an instrumental variable framework to estimate the impact of the female hires on venture capital firm performance.  \n\n#### 4.1. Effects on Venture Capital Hiring  \n\nIn Table VIl, we show the effects of daughters on the proportion of female partners hired. As discussed earlier, our dependent variable is the ratio of females hired to the total number of hires in a new fund (the five-year period commencing from raising a new fund). We express data on children by averaging across all the partners of the firm for whom we have children's gender. We include the average number of daughters that partners have as well as the average number of children. We also include a variety of firm-level controls including firm size (number of existing partners), firm age, whether the firm has a female investment professional prior to this fund, and the average partner age. In column (1), we observe a positive coefficient on the average number of daughters, implying a positive relationship between parenting more daughters (holding the number of children constant) and the ratio of female hires in a new fund. It is also important to note that holding the number of daughters constant, increasing the average number of children reduces the probability of hiring a female investor. Adding additional firm-level controls does not change the magnitude of the effect that daughters have on the hiring decisions with coefficients remaining statistically significant at $5\\%$ . As such, we use column (3) as our main specification and always include these controls when applicable throughout the paper. In this specification, conditioning on the total number of children, the relative effect of existing partners having one more daughter increases the ratio of female hires by an amount of $1.93\\%$ . Given that, on average, firms have a female hired ratio of $8.03\\%$ , this is a substantial increase of $25\\%$  \n\nTo further put this in context, we also notice that the binary variable “having female before hiring\"’ has a large and statistically significant coefficient of $5.24\\%$ , consistent with the presence of gender-based homophily in hiring. Notice that the inclusion of this variable also renders the coefficient on firm size statistically insignificant. It also means the relative effect of having one more daughter on average is about $40\\%$ of the magnitude of having an existing female partner in the firm. Here, we are cautious about the fact that “having female before hiring’ is not exogenous, but this coefficient is more likely to be upward biased given the plausible correlation between the existence of female partners and unobservable gender atitudes. Our exogenous daughter effect, therefore, remains sizable (and its magnitude plausible) relative to the organizational feature of a pre-existing female partner.  \n\nWe also observe that the results for the daughter effect hold strongly for senior partners, but not as much for junior partners. The size of the coefficient on the average number of daughters for senior partners is roughly three times as large as the coefficient on the average number of partners for junior partners. Here, senior partners are those that have been with the firm for more than 5 years and likely wield stronger influences in the hiring decisions. This suggests that the main effects are driven by the senior partners? daughters in the venture capital firms. This is intuitively consistent with the view that the hiring decisions are mainly driven by the members of the firm who have a longer tenure and thus more “senior'.  \n\nWe can see our main result from these regressions in Figure 1. In the first panel, we divide firms into those in which the existing partners have more daughters, have an equal number of daughters and sons, and firms with more sons. Firms with more daughters and an equal number of daughters and sons have significantly higher ratios of females that are hired ( $10.59\\%$ and $10.57\\%$ ) than firms with more sons $(8.93\\%)$ . The pattern is even stronger when we look only at the gender of senior partners. For firms in which the existing senior partners have more daughters, the ratio of female hires is $11.87\\%$ . Firms in which existing senior partners have an equal number of sons and daughters have a female hired ratio of $9.78\\%$ . Finally, in firms in which existing senior partners have more sons, the female hired ratio is $8.68\\%$  \n\nWe also run the first stage regression with several alternative measures of gender composition of existing partners? children shown in Table VIll. This is motivated by the concern that the potential effect may not be linear in the number of daughters relative to the total number of children. As such, we look at variables such as the average of the proportion of daughters, the excess number of daughters over sons, the proportion of partners with more daughters, the proportion of partners whose first child is a daughter, and the proportion of partners with at least one daughter. With the same controls including holding constant the number of children, we observe that the first four variables are all positive but with varying degres of statistical significance. Therefore, we are confident that when existing partners have relatively more daughters, there is a positive relationship with hiring more female investors. What is also worth pointing out is that the variable on “\"having female before hiring? also remains positive and statistically significant across all these alternative specifications.  \n\nFurthermore, we provide a simple placebo test in Table IX that sheds some light on the findings. In particular, with the same controls, we find that the “number of daughters\" has a positive relationship with the count of female hires, but a negative relationship with the number of male hires. The average number of daughters has no effect on the total number of hires. This suggests the potential mechanism that having relatively more daughters raises the female hired ratio by hiring more partners overall is not true. Have more daughters leads to a substitution in the hiring of males for the hiring of females without an effect on the total number of new hires. This suggests that the daughter effect is more likely a removal of bias towards hiring females.  \n\nBefore turning to the investment performance results, we also test whether or not the gender of existing partners’ children affects the gender of founders in the portfolio companies of the venture capital firm. One might hypothesize that the daughter effect not only affects the hiring of female partners, but also investment in portfolio companies founded by a female entrepreneur. However, Table X shows that there is no statistically significant relationship between the average number of daughters (holding the number of children constant) and the fraction of portfolio company founders who are women. What does turn out to be significant is that the presence of female VC investor. Having a female partner is strongly correlated with the investment into companies with a female entrepreneur, as shown in column (4). Therefore, even though there is a strong gender-based homophily between the venture capital partner and the portfolio founder, in this reduced form, we do not find statistical evidence that the children's gender of the existing partners directly affects the investment in female entrepreneurs, unlike the employment of female partners.  \n\n#### 4.2. Effects on Venture Capital Performance  \n\nIn the prior section, we established a strong causal link between having a greater fraction of children who are daughters and hiring more female investors. In this section, we explore the performance implications of this effect. We regress the deal or fund level performance on children's gender. Since multiple deals or funds can be associated with a given venture capital firm, we make sure the firm identity, the fund identity, and the deal are all appropriately matched for the purpose of our reduced form regression:  \n\n$$\nY_{j}=\\beta_{1}\\#D a u g h t e r s_{i(j),t(j)}+\\beta_{2}\\#C h i l d r e n_{i(j),t(j)}+C o n t r o l s_{j}+\\epsilon_{j}\n$$  \n\nAt the deal level, $Y_{j}$ is an indicator for deal success, while #Daughte $\\cdot s_{i(j),t(j)}$ refers to the average number of daughters by partners of firm $i$ which made the deal $j$ in year $t$ Besides the firm-level controls, we also add deal level controls including the industry, the country, the funding round, and whether the firm had a female VC partner on the deal. Analogously, for the fund level regressions, $Y_{j}$ is the net IRR achieved by the fund, while #Daughtersi(),t(i) refers to the number of daughters by partners of firm $i$ who finished raising for fund $j$ in year $t$ In this case, we add fund level controls including the log fund size and the fund region. Therefore, these are reduced-form attempts to directly estimate the economic gains (losses) that are due to having relatively more daughters by the venture capital partners.  \n\nIn Table XI, the dependent variable is a binary “success” indicator based on whether the deal has resulted in an IPO or a successful acquisition where the acquisition value is greater than the amount of capital invested. In column (1)-(3), we see a positive and significant coefficient on the number of daughters across allspecifications. In the main specification column (3), the point estimate suggests that a relative increase of one daughter on average leads to an increased probability of success by $2.88\\%$ . Compared with the overall success rate of $28.7\\%$ , this is a meaningful magnitude. Therefore, in a reduced form, we find strong evidence of a relationship between the gender of a venture capitalists? children and performance.  \n\nWe also find a positive significant coefficient for the firm size. Similarly, venture capital age is positively related to success rates. This is consistent with the survival of better performing firms. Surprisingly, we find that venture capital partner age is negatively related to success.  \n\nIn Table XI Panel A column (4) and (5), we also evaluate the reduced form regression for senior partners and junior partners separately. Similar to the regression on female hires, we find that the deal-level successes are entirely driven by the relationship with senior partners’ daughters, with a larger point estimate as well as a larger t-statistics than column (3). The coefficient for junior partners? daughters is not statistically significant, shown in column (5). As before, this is consistent with an interpretation where the senior partners are the main decision-makers, as opposed to the junior partners.  \n\nWe also present the reduced form result if we focus just on IPO. Although IPO alone may not be a good measure of success because IPO rates have generally declined over the past decade and the importance of high value acquisitions has increased, it is more accurately measured because not all acquisition values are publicly available. In Table XI Panel B, we find moderately statistically significant results for the number of daughters of existing partners. Similar to Panel A, we find that the t-statistics increases if we focus only on the senior partners’ children characteristics, and the relationship completely vanishes for junior partners. Other results are also similar to Panel A.  \n\nSo far, our main analysis is based on a binary measure of success for each venture capital deals. However, there may be a meaningful difference between two “successful’ exits in terms of the actual rate of return that is achieved. However, in order to take this into account, it is challenging to obtain comprehensive deal-level returns. Fortunately, we are able to match a meaningful portion of the venture capital funds in our sample to the Preqin database in which we can access the fund level internal rates of returns (IRR). We match 395 of 1270 funds in our sample and perform the same reduced form regression as before, controlling for log fund size.  \n\nDespite the limited sample size, consistent with the findings in the deal-level sample, Table XII column (1) to (3) shows strong positive and statistically significant coefficients for the number of daughters, i.e., our reduced form regression indicates a positive relationship between the fund return and the number of daughters, controlling for the total number of children. We use “excess return\" of the fund as the independent variable, which is defined as a fund's net IRR minus the median fund return raised in the same region and year provided by the Preqin database. In column (3), we find that the relative effect of having a daughter over a son is a $3.2\\%$ increase in excess return for the fund. In comparison, the average net IRR is $14.1\\%$ and the average excess return is $3.9\\%$ for the funds in our sample. As expected, we also find that the estimate holds for measures of children's gender for senior partners only, not for junior partners.  \n\nOur two main results establish that the parenting of a daughter relative to a son by venture capital partners, especially by senior partners, leads to a significant increase in the proportion of female partner hired. We also saw in the reduced form regression, that there is significant improvement in the firm's performance, where performance is measured in a variety of ways at both the deal and the fund level. Not only does the statistical significance remain robust across different specifications, the economic magnitude of the estimated coefficients is also substantial: The relative effect of having on average a daughter rather than a son by existing partners increases the female hired ratio by $1.93\\%$ compared with a base rate of $8.03\\%$ . It lifts deal success by about $2.88\\%$ , given the overall success rate at $28.7\\%$ . It also translates to an increase of $3.20\\%$ in net IRR compared to average fund returns Of $14.1\\%$ . Moreover, these are causally identified.  \n\n#### 4.3. Instrumental Variable Regression  \n\nHaving established a strong, positive relationship between having more daughters and hiring female investors and fund performance, we next explore an instrumental variables specification in which we identify exogenous increases in fund gender diversity and its effect on investment performance. In particular, we use the average number of daughters of the existing partners as an instrument for the variations in the female hire ratio.  \n\nFor the causal interpretation of the female hired ratio to apply here, the relevant exclusion restriction is that the effect of parenting daughters affects venture capital investment performance only through the proportion of female partners hired. We find this exclusion restriction plausible. One concern might be that parenting more daughters leads the partner to invest in more companies with female founders and that perhaps the average quality of those entrepreneurs are higher than the male entrepreneurs because they are often overlooked by other firms. However, as shown in Table X, this is not the case because the proportion of female founders does not increase with the number of daughters that an existing partner has. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the coefficient would be biased if the number of daughters was still correlated with other unobservables that affects deal outcomes. In other words, one could contend that the effects may not only come from the extensive margin on hiring, but could also come from the intensive margin such as assigning existing female employees more responsibilities as well as other unobservables. Therefore, we believe the causal relationship demonstrated in the reduced form between the number of daughters and the performance is our strongest evidence of an effect.  \n\nWe employ a linear IV regression framework for estimation.7 In Table XIII Panel A, we see that that the IV regression coefficient for “female hired ratio\" is large, positive, and statistically significant. We present OLS as well as the IV estimates. We find that the IV estimator loads significantly only on senior partners, not the junior ones, consistent with previous findings. The coefficient of 0.965 in column 4 implies that if the female hired ratio increases by $10\\%$ due to the daughter effect, the deal success rate would increase by $9.65\\%$ . Recall that the overall success rate is $28.8\\%$ in our deal-level sample. By comparison the OLS estimate is 0.079. Together, this suggests when more female partners are hired because of changes brought about by more daughters, its effect on the deal performance is much larger than what OLS implies.  \n\nIn terms of robustness, when we narrow the definition of deal success to IPO only, Table XIII Panel B shows that we obtain similar results, but as before with slightly weak statistical significance. The female hired a ratio has a coefficient of 0.361 in column (4), suggesting a $10\\%$ increase in the proportion of female hired leads to a $3.61\\%$ increase in IPO rate. This compares with an overall IPO rate of $14.2\\%$ in our overall sample. Similarly, we find the effects are attributable mainly to the senior partners.  \n\nFurthermore, when we change the outcome variable from the deal level to the fund level in Table XIV, we find noisier, but directionally similar results. While not all the results are statistically significant, they all go in the same direction as the deal level results. The lower significance level is driven primarily by the smaller sample size. Deals are collapsed into fund returns, reducing the number of observations by a factor of 10. Similarly, we only have fund return data on approximately one fourth of our funds. This means we have roughly $2.5\\%$ of the number of observations for fund returns as we do for deals.  \n\n#### 4.4. Robustness and Alternative Specifications  \n\nIn this section, we describe a few robustness checks, as well as several additional specifications that could shed more light on the results.  \n\nOne of the concerns regarding the sample is that about $34\\%$ of the children information is obtained from email solicitations. If the respondents are self-selected in terms of their parental involvement, this will likely bias the results. In Table XVI, we run the same analysis excluding the email respondents while including only those whom we obtain information from public sources. We find that the daughter effects on female hiring and deal performance remain robust, and so is the instrumental variable regression. However, the statistical significance is weaker likely due to the reduced sample size. Another robustness check we run is to cover every venture capitalist in the dataset, including those who have made fewer than 3 deals. This accounts for about $41\\%$ Of the venture capitalists. Table XVIl shows that all of our results continue to hold with similar magnitude and statistical significance. Additionally, we also break the results down by the number of daughters for male and female partners of the firm. The results remain robust for the male partners, as shown in Online Appendix Table IV, while the results for female partners become less significant likely due to the severe drop in sample size.  \n\nMoreover, we also investigate whether the age of the children matters for hiring and performance. In Online Appendix Table III, we include both the number of daughters over the age of 12 and the number of daughters under 12. Interestingly and perhaps unsurprisingly, these regressions tend to load significant coefficients on the number of teenage daughters, rather than the number of pre-teen daughters. This might suggest that older daughters may have more of an effect on the attitudes of their fathers. This is consistent with fathers observing potential gender biases that their daughters face as they get older.  \n\n#### 4.5. Discussions on the Economic Magnitude  \n\nIn our paper, we established a causal relationship that having more daughters relative to sons for venture capital partners leads to a higher proportion of female partners being hired. This increase in the hiring of female investors is exogenous to the firm and, through the IV specifications, we find that the exogenous increase in gender diversity leads to an improvement in the performance of the venture capital firm. Although we have seen in the literature how children can affect parental behavior and attitudes, one important contribution of the paper is to provide an estimate of the potential economic magnitude on the benefits of gender diversity in a business setting. In Table XV, we documented the historical IPO amount by all the VC-backed companies. From 1990 to 2010, the total amount of capital raised through IPOs is $\\$91.6$ billion by over 800 companies.  \n\nWe can now combine the first stage and the IV coefficient to provide an estimate of the economic impact. Recall that the first stage regression coefficient from Table Vll implies that the relative effect of having a daughter instead of a son raises the female hired ratio by $1.93\\%$ from a base rate of $8.03\\%$ . Combining this with the IV coefficient from Table XIlI, this translates into an increase of $0.70\\%$ in the probability of an IPO (compared with a base rate of $14.2\\%$ . Together, this implies the relative effect of having a daughter versus a son is that an additional $\\$4.5$ bn could have been raised. Moreover, if we think that the base rate of female hired ratio $8.03\\%$ could be increased by $10\\%$ , namely from the current level of $8.03\\%$ to $18.03\\%$ , this would translate into an additional $\\$23.2$ bn being raised.  \n\nThis back-of-the-envelope calculation is an extrapolation from the partial equilibrium, without the constraint that there may only be a fixed number of listable companies. However, it is also not obvious that this is necessarily an upper-bound because an improvement in the venture capital firm's ability to differentiate and finance better deals could generate dynamic responses from the entrepreneurial side as well. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, this paper is a first attempt in the literature to link the value of diversity with the better performance in an investment setting.  \n\n### 5. Conclusion  \n\nWhile diversity has been lauded as an important cornerstone of modern civil society and contemporary workplace, there have been few rigorous studies, to our knowledge, that estimate the causal economic impact of a diverse workforce in a real business setting. In this paper, we address the effect of gender diversity by collecting a unique dataset of venture capitalists? children’'s gender and taking advantage of a research design where this gender is exogenous to the individual partner. Combined with the time series of the hiring of senior investment professionals and deal performance, we establish that a relative increase in the number of daughters relative to the number of sons leads to a significant and economically meaningful increase in the proportion of females hired. In reduced form regressions, this higher relative fraction of daughters is related to improved deal and fund level performance. In instrumental variables regressions, we demonstrate that the exogenously induced increases in firm gender diversity lead to improvements in performance. These results provide convincing evidence in a real business setting that performance is improved with greater gender diversity. One important caveat is that this result does not necessarily imply that implementing a blunt gender quota would bring about the same positive outcomes, whereas improved diversity through a genuine removal of biases is likely more beneficial.  \n\nWe would like to emphasize the importance of understanding the role that this subtle removal of gender bias has for increasing diversity. The subtle treatment effects that prior research has shown to influence US Congressmen's votes (Washington, 2008) and Federal judge rulings (Glynn and Sen, 2015) also plays a role here in causing fathers to increase the likelihood that they hire a female investor. Our results suggest that diversity achieved through genuine removal of a bias or change in belief can lead to better economic outcomes. We believe that further research efforts into uncovering how exactly the parenting of a daughter and improved gender diversity improves outcomes could be fruitful.  \n\nThere are several potential explanations we feel are important to explore. First, parenting daughters reduces the bias that one has towards women, which leads to more female hires. Given that the pool of potential female investors is relatively untapped, these female investors are of higher quality than the counterfactual male hires. The higher quality hires then generate higher returns. A second potential explanations is that having a diverse set of backgrounds around the table to make decisions about investments may reduce correlated errors in judgment. Since homophily in hiring in venture capital is strong, most venture capital firms are populated by men of the same ethnicity with similar schooling and work histories. Different perspectives may reduce groupthink and allow venture capital firms to avoid costly investment mistakes. Third, because so much of venture capital investment success is driven by having access to the best deals (Gompers,  \n\nGornall, Kaplan, and Strebulaev, 2017), having more diverse backgrounds may attract a much wider deal flow and, hence, average deal quality may increase. We believe that future research on these potential mechanisms will be  very  fruitful  for understanding the source of performance improvement that greater gender diversity engenders.  \n\n## References  \n\nAsch, S.

Chemmanur Carroll School of Management, Boston College  \n\nKarthik Krishnan College of Business Administration, Northeastern University  \n\nDebarshi K. Nandy International Business School, Brandeis University  \n\nWe use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which covers the entire universe of private and public U.S. manufacturing firms, to study several related questions regarding the efficiency gains generated by venture capital (VC) investment in private firms. First, do VCs indeed improve the efficiency (total factor productivity, TFP) of private firms, and if so, are certain kinds of VCs (high reputation vs. low reputation) better at generating such efficiency gains than others? Second, do VCs invest in more efficient firms to begin with (screening), or do they improve efficiency after investment (monitoring)? Third, do efficiency improvements due to VC backing arise from increases in sales or reductions in costs? Fourth, do VC backing and the associated efficiency gains affect the probability of a successful exit (IPO or acquisition)? Our analysis shows that the overall efficiency of VC-backed firms is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms at every point in time. This efficiency advantage of VC-backed firms arises from both screening and monitoring: The effciency of VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms, and further, the growth in efficiency subsequent to VC financing is greater for such firms. The above increases in efficiency of VC-backed firms are spread over the first two rounds of VC financing after which the TFP of such firms remains constant until exit. Additionally, we show that while the TFP of firms prior to receiving financing is lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms, the increase in TFP subsequent to financing is significantly greater for these firms, consistent with high-reputation VCs having greater monitoring ability. We disentangle the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing using three different methodologies: switching regression with endogenous switching, regression discontinuity analysis, and propensity score matching. We show that while overall efficiency gains generated by VC backing arise primarily from improvements in sales, the efficiency gains of high-reputation VCbacked firms arise also from lower increases in production costs. Finally, we show that VC backing and the associated efficiency gains positively affect the probability of a successful exit.(JELG24)  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nThe role of venture capital (VC) financing in creating value for entrepreneurial firms has been widely debated in both the academic and practitioner literature. In particular, several authors in the theoretical VC literature have argued that, in addition to providing financing, VCs provide other services to private firms that can considerably enhance the probability of success of these firms (see, e.g., Berglof 1994; Casamatta 2003; Hellmann 1998; Schmidt 2003; Ueda 2004). Another theoretical literature argues that access to private financing (such as venture capital) can significantly affect the extent of innovation and therefore the productivity of a private firm when it faces competition from other firms in the product market. A prominent example of this literature is Spiegel and Tookes (2008). Their model predicts that firms will finance projects with the greatest revenue-generating ability privately (e.g., under venture financing), and will then go to the public markets only when more modest innovations remain. Practitioners also argue that in addition to providing funding for private firms, VCs contribute greatly to their success in many other ways —for example, by helping them in hiring competent management, providing better incentives to firm management and employees, as well as by allowing them access to their network of contacts among suppliers and potential customers in the product market. Further, both academics and practitioners have argued that high-reputation VCs are better at providing the above services than low-reputation VCs.2 Despite the above large theoretical and practitioner literature that argues that VCs may create significant value in the product market, empirical evidence on whether VCs indeed create such value has been relatively scarce (with some exceptions that we discuss later), perhaps due to limitations on the availability of data on private firms.  \n\nThis article addresses the above gap in the empirical literature by conducting a novel large sample study and analyzing the role of venture capitalists in creating productivity improvements for entrepreneurial firms using a unique database covering the universe of private firms in the U.S. manufacturing sector obtained from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Bureau of Census. Manufacturing firms account for approximately $41\\%$ of the total number of VC-backed firms in VentureXpert and approximately $31\\%$ of all VC financing rounds between 1972 and 2000 with total VC investment in these firms being above $\\$150$ billion: Some prominent examples of manufacturing firms that have received VC financing in the past are Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cisco Systems, Genentech, Genzyme, Texas Instruments, Imclone, Mattel, Dell, and Sun Microsystems. Our sample of VC-backed firms is fairly representative of what we would expect of VC-backed firms (with some exceptions), with high levels of concentration in computers, biotech, electronics, and other high-tech industries such as precision instruments. The sectors that are excluded from our sample are non-packaged software, e-commerce and Internet, and other service-oriented industries such as financials. It should be noted that approximately $62\\%$ of high-tech industries, in which VCs are more inclined to invest, fall within the scope of the LRD, as these industries are part of the manufacturing sector (i.e., having Standard Industrial Classification [SIC] codes between 2000 and 3999).  \n\nWe answer several interesting questions regarding the role played by VCs in creating “extra-financial\" value for private firms that they invest in. We study whether VCs indeed create such value for entrepreneurial firms, and if so, how and when this value is created. We answer the following questions: First, do VC-backed firms have better performance and higher operating efficiency (as measured by total factor productivity, or TFP) than non-VCbacked firms? Second, if indeed this is the case, precisely how do VCs create value for private firms: Are they able to identify and invest in higher quality entrepreneurial firms——-i.e., selection or “screening\"—or does the value creation arise primarily from the various extra-financial value-added services they provide to the firm (discussed earlier) subsequent to their investing in the firm—i.e., “\"monitoring\"? We wish to emphasize here that by monitoring we refer to both value-addition by venture capitalists, such as product market support (potentially using the VC's network of contacts) and expert advice, as well as explicit monitoring activities such as scrutinizing management actions, professionalizing management, and setting incentive compensation schemes. Third, what are the precise channels through which VCs improve the productivity of private firms? In particular, do these efficiency improvements arise from better aggregate product market performance (sales) of VC-backed firms relative to non- VC-backed firms? Or do they arise from lower production costs of VC-backed firms relative to non-VC-backed firms?3 Fourth, if the value-addition due to VC backing is at least partly due to monitoring, how are these value improvements spread over time: Do they occur in the early stages immediately after the VCs invest in the firm, or do they occur in later stages? Fifth, are more reputable VCs capable of creating greater value by improving the efficiency of firms they invest in? In particular, are high-reputation VCs better at screening or monitoring (or both) than low-reputation VCs? Further, are the efficiency improvements arising through the various channels of sales and cost improvements greater for firms backed by high-reputation VCs than for those backed by low-reputation VCs? Finally, how do VC backing and productivity improvements affect the probability of a successful exit (IPO or acquisition) as opposed to that of a write-off?  \n\nThe results of our empirical analysis can be summarized as follows. We start by investigating whether VC-backed firms are characterized by greater overall efficiency compared with non-VC-backed firms. Similar to several other papers that have used the LRD database to study various corporate events (see, e.g., Schoar 2002; Maksimovich and Philips 2008; Chemmanur, He, and Nandy 2010), we use total factor productivity (TFP) as our measure of firm efficiency. TFP growth measures the residual growth in a firm's output after accounting for the growth in output attributable to the various factors of production and the production technology in place. In other words, an increase in TFP is an increase in the overall productivity (efficiency) of the firm, since more output can now be produced than earlier, with each of the factors of production remaining the same. Venture capital financing involves an injection of additional capital into the firm, which may increase the scale of the firm and thus a mechanical increase in output and revenue. Therefore, TFP is a particularly appropriate measure to analyze the increase in firm performance due to VC backing, since it captures productivity changes after accounting for increases in the scale of production, which will not be captured by more traditional measures such as revenue or sales growth. As a robustness test, we also conduct our analysis using alternative measures of performance such as labor productivity and return on assets (ROA) and find that our results are similar to the ones we find using the TFP measure.  \n\nWe find that the efficiency of VC-backed firms (as measured by TFP) prior to receiving venture financing is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms, and further, the growth in TFP subsequent to receiving venture financing is greater for VC-backed firms relative to non-VC-backed firms. We thus find evidence of both a screening and a monitoring role for VCs in improving firm efficiency. In our analysis of the dynamics of productivity growth, we first show that the above improvement in TFP of VC-backed firms relative to non  \n\nHowDoes Venture Capital Financing ImproveEffciency in PrivateFirms?  \n\nVC-backed firms increases over the four years subsequent to the year of the first round of venture financing, and remains at this higher level until exit. This is the first article to document the above finding in the literature. We also analyze the above dynamics in TFP changes round-by-round for VC-backed firms. The results of our round-by-round analysis are consistent with those discussed above and show that most of the efficiency gains for VC-backed firms are concentrated around the first couple of rounds of VC investment in the firm.  \n\nTo control for the possibility that VCs may merely be providing funding to better-quality firms, which then go on to perform better subsequently (in other words, to address any potential endogeneity or selection issues related to VC backing), we employ three alternative methodologies. The first methodology we employ is “switching regressions with endogenous switching,” which controls for unobservable characteristics that affect both the probability of getting VC financing for an entrepreneurial firm as well as its productivity. The results from this regression are used to perform a counterfactual analysis that answers the following question: What would the TFP growth of VCbacked firms have been had they not received such financing (and vice versa)? Clearly, the difference between the actual TFP growth of VC-backed firms and the hypothetical level estimated from the above “what-if ” analysis yields the TFP growth attributable to the monitoring effect of VC backing. Consistent with our earlier results, our switching regression results indicate a significantly positive effect of VC monitoring on TFP growth. Specifically, we find that TFP growth would have been smaller for VC-backed firms had they not received VC financing, and TFP growth would have been greater for non-VC-backed firms had they received VC financing.  \n\nThe second methodology we use to distinguish between screening and monitoring is a regression discontinuity analysis. This approach uses a discontinuous jump in the probability of obtaining VC financing to identify the causal effect of VC involvement on TFP growth. We exploit the eligibility requirements for firms to obtain financial support from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to identify a jump in the probability of VC financing, since firms that are not eligible for SBA support are more likely to seek external financing sources such as venture capital. Consistent with our previous results documenting the monitoring ability of VCs, we find a positive causal effect of VC financing on the TFP growth of private firms receiving such financing.  \n\nThe third methodology we employ is a matched sample analysis using a propensity score matching algorithm.4 Using this methodology, we match our sample of VC-backed firms to non-VC-backed private firms along the following dimensions: firm size, industry, and average TFP over the five years prior to receiving venture financing. Consistent with our earlier results, we find that the TFP growth of VC-backed firms subsequent to receiving financing is significantly greater than that of matching firms, thus confirming the monitoring effect of VC backing on TFP growth.  \n\nOur results on the channels through which VC backing improves efficiency can be summarized as follows. First, VC-backed firms are characterized by higher sales than non-VC-backed firms prior to receiving venture financing. Further, these firms are characterized by a greater increase in sales in the years subsequent to receiving venture financing compared with non-VCbacked firms. Second, total production costs are greater for VC-backed firms compared with non-VC-backed firms prior to receiving venture financing; the growth in these costs subsequent to receiving financing is also greater for VCbacked firms relative to non-VC-backed firms. Third, while total employment is similar for VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms prior to receiving venture financing, total salaries and wages are greater for VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing. Additionally, the growth in total salaries and wages subsequent to receiving financing is greater for VC-backed firms relative to non-VC-backed firms, though the growth in the level of employment remains comparable across the two kinds of firms. Overall, the above results indicate that the primary channel through which VC backing improves efficiency is by improving product market performance (sales). This increase in sales could partly be attributed to a better-quality workforce employed by VC-backed firms.  \n\nWe also find that while the TFP of firms prior to VC financing is higher for low-reputation VC-backed firms, the growth in TFP subsequent to financing is higher for high-reputation VC-backed firms relative to that for low-reputation VC-backed firms. This finding suggests that while low-reputation VCs rely on selecting more effcient firms to begin with (screening), high-reputation VCs are able to improve the efficiency of the firms they invest in to a greater extent, suggesting that they have greater monitoring ability. Consistent with these results, we find significantly higher TFP at every round subsequent to receiving financing for high-reputation VC-backed firms compared with lowreputation VC-backed firms. Further, the increase in TFP in each round of VC financing (relative to the TFP before VC financing) is significantly greater for firms backed by high-reputation VCs, again suggesting greater monitoring ability for such VCs.  \n\nOur findings regarding the differences between high-reputation and lowreputation VCs in terms of the channels through which they improve the efficiency of their portfolio firms can be summarized as follows. First, the level of sales prior to receiving financing is greater for high-reputation VCbacked firms compared with low-reputation VC-backed firms, and the growth in sales subsequent to financing (in the first four years) is also greater for high-reputation VC-backed firms. Second, total production costs prior to venture financing are lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms compared with low-reputation VC-backed firms, and the growth in total production  \n\nHowDoes Venture Capital Financing ImproveEffciency in PrivateFirms?  \n\ncosts subsequent to financing is also lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms compared with low-reputation VC-backed firms. The above two results indicate that high-reputation VCs are able to generate greater increases in sales (output) with lower increases in production costs, thus leading to greater improvements in the TFP of firms backed by them, compared with lowreputation VCs. Overall, these results are consistent with the notion that the primary channel through which both high- and low-reputation VCs improve efficiency is through improvements in product market performance (sales); for high-reputation VCs, additional improvements in efficiency arise through reductions in input costs as well.  \n\nFinally, the results of our analysis on the impact of VC backing and efficiency improvements on the probability of a successful exit can be summarized as follows. First, VC financing has a positive association with the probability of a successful exit (either through an IPO or through an acquisition). Second, the probability of an exit through an IPO is increasing in both the average level of TFP prior to each year and TFP growth. The above results are consistent with the notion that VC backing and efficiency improvements have a long-lived impact and result in a higher likelihood of successful exit.5 They also suggest that firms with higher levels of efficiency improvements are more likely to exit through an IPO rather than an acquisition.6  \n\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and sample selection procedures and explains the construction of various variables used in this study. Section 3 describes our empirical methodology and presents the results of our multivariate analyses relating VC backing to increases in firm efficiency. Section 4 provides a discussion of the analyses used to empirically distinguish between VC screening and monitoring using the following three methodologies: switching regression, regression discontinuity, and propensity score based matching. Section 5 analyzes the channels through which TFP and efficiency improvements are generated for VC-backed firms. Section 6 presents some of the above analyses for high- versus low-reputation VC-backed firms. Section 7 analyzes how VC backing and improvements in efficiency impact the exit decisions of firms. Section 8 discusses how our article is related to the existing literature, and Section 9 concludes.  \n\n## 2. Data, Sample Selection, and Construction of Variables  \n\nThe primary data used in this study are obtained from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), maintained by the Center of Economic Studies at the U.S. Census Bureau.7 The LRD is a large micro database that provides plant-level information for firms in the manufacturing sector (SIC codes 2000 to 3999). In the census years (1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997), the LRD covers the entire universe of manufacturing plants in the Census of Manufacturers (CM). In non-census years, the LRD tracks approximately 50,000 manufacturing plants every year in the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), which covers all plants with more than 250 employees with probability one. In addition, it also includes smaller plants that are randomly selected every fifth year to complete a rotating five-year panel. Therefore, all U.S. manufacturing plants with more than 250 employees are included in the LRD database on a yearly basis from 1972 to 2000, and smaller plants with fewer than 250 employees are included in the LRD database every census year and are also randomly included in the non-census years, continuously for five years, as a rotating five-year panel.8 Most of the data items reported in the LRD (e.g., the number of employees, employee compensation, and total value of shipments) represent items that are also reported to the IRS, increasing the accuracy of the data.  \n\nThe two major difficulties in conducting research on VC financing and its effects on firms’ performance are first, obtaining firm-specific data on private firms that receive VC financing, and second, obtaining data on private firms that could potentially obtain VC financing but do not. Clearly, publicly available firm-level databases such as Compustat do not meet this criteria since it only has data on publicly traded firms. An alternate data source is another panel dataset collected by the U.s. Census Bureau, namely the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD).9 The major advantages of using the LRD relative to the LBD for this study are the following: First, assets, sales, operating costs, and other such firm-level financial information are either not covered or mostly missing in the LBD compared with the LRD. Thus, our overall metric of firm efficiency—-i.e., total factor productivity (TFP)—can be constructed only for the LRD panel. Second, the nature of the LRD allows us to identify the precise channels of value improvements in firms resulting from VC investments, which would not have been possible had we used the LBD. Due to these reasons, we focus on the LRD for the purposes of this study.  \n\nOur sample of VC investments is drawn from VentureXpert, a database maintained by Thomson Financial, which contains round-by-round information for both the firms in which VCs invest as well as the VC firms themselves.  \n\nIt provides information on the names and locations of VCs who invest in each round of the firm, the number of such VCs, the total amount invested per round, and also the date of each round of investment. Our initial extract from VentureXpert gives us a sample of 12,481 U.S.-based firms whose first round of VC financing lies between 1972 and 2000. This sample excludes any investment made by VC funds for buyout or acquisition purposes or where the purpose of the first round of investment was unknown or missing. We then merge this sample of firms to the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), which is a list of all business establishments in the United States maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau and updated on an annual basis.10 We employ standard matching procedures using the names and addresses of firms that are commonly used by U.S. Census Bureau researchers and those working with these databases, which yields a positive match for 10,355 firms, giving us a match rate of about $83\\%$ 11 We then restrict the sample to the manufacturing sector (SIC codes 2000 to 3999), and merge to the LRD. We keep only those firms for which we have detailed information to calculate TFP at the fourdigit SIC and annual level, which leaves us with a final sample of $1{,}881\\mathrm{VC}{\\cdot}$ backed firms representing 16,824 firm-years of data. This sample represents approximately $36\\%$ of VC-backed manufacturing firms from VentureXpert that are matched to the SSEL.12 Alternatively, assuming that the proportion of manufacturing firms in VentureXpert is similar to that in the SSEL, our sample of 1,881 U.S. manufacturing firms represents approximately $30\\%$ of all U.S. manufacturing firms that received VC financing between 1972 and 2000. It is also worth pointing out that our sample contains roughly $15\\%$ of all U.s. VC-backed firms (manufacturing as well as non-manufacturing) that received VC financing between 1972 and 2000. Overall, while our sample is  \n\nsomewhat tilted toward large, later-stage firms, it is fairly representative of U.S.   \nmanufacturing firms that received VC financing during the 1972-2000 period.  \n\nPanel A of Table 1 presents the industry distribution at the two-digit SIC level of the firms that received VC financing in our sample, while Panel B presents the number of firms that received their first round of VC financing in any given year over our sample period. As can be seen from this table, our matched sample of VC-backed firms is fairly representative of what we would expect of venture capital firms (with some exceptions), with high levels of concentration in computers, biotech, electronics, and other high-tech industries, such as precision instruments. However, non-packaged software, e-commerce and Internet, and other service-oriented firms, such as financial firms, are not included in our sample. It should be noted that approximately $62\\%$ of the high-tech industries, including computers, telecom, biotech, and other industries, in which VCs are more inclined to invest (as anecdotal evidence suggests), fall within the scope of the LRD, as these industries are part of the manufacturing sector—i.e., having 4-digit SIC codes between 2000 and 3999. In addition, consistent with anecdotal evidence, one can also observe that VC investment in new firms increased during the Internet bubble period of thelate1990s.  \n\nTable1 Industry and year distribution of VC-backed firms matched to LRD   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\">PanelA:IndustryDistribution</td><td colspan=\"4\">PanelB:YearDistribution</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">2-Digit SIC</td><td colspan=\"3\">Year of First VC</td></tr><tr><td>Code</td><td colspan=\"2\">Industry Description</td><td></td><td>Freq.Percentage</td><td>Financing</td><td>Freq.</td><td>Percentage</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td colspan=\"2\">Food and kindred products Textile mill products</td><td>61 30</td><td>3.24 1.59</td><td>1972</td><td>18</td><td>0.96</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td colspan=\"2\">Apparel and other textile products</td><td>35</td><td>1.86</td><td>1973 1974</td><td>29</td><td>1.54</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td colspan=\"2\">Lumber and wood products</td><td>25</td><td>1.33</td><td></td><td>16</td><td>0.85</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td colspan=\"2\">Furniture and fixtures</td><td>18</td><td>0.96</td><td>1975</td><td>24</td><td>1.28</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td colspan=\"2\">Paper and allied products</td><td>32</td><td>1.7</td><td>1976 1977</td><td>24 30</td><td>1.28</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td colspan=\"2\">Printing and publishing</td><td>96</td><td>5.1</td><td>1978</td><td>53</td><td>1.59</td></tr><tr><td>27 28</td><td colspan=\"2\">Chemicals and allied products (Biotech)</td><td>95</td><td>5.05</td><td>1979</td><td>46</td><td>2.82</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td colspan=\"2\">Petroleum and coal products</td><td>10</td><td>0.53</td><td>1980</td><td>71</td><td>2.45</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td colspan=\"2\">Rubber and miscellaneous plastics products</td><td>68</td><td>3.62</td><td>1981</td><td>102</td><td>3.77</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td colspan=\"2\">Leather andleather products</td><td>25</td><td>1.33</td><td>1982</td><td>101</td><td>5.42</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td colspan=\"2\">Stone, clay, and glass products</td><td>67</td><td>3.56</td><td>1983</td><td>119</td><td>5.37</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td colspan=\"2\">Primary metal industries</td><td>227</td><td>12.07</td><td>1984</td><td>94</td><td>6.33</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Fabricated metal products</td><td>82</td><td>4.36</td><td>1985</td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td colspan=\"2\">Industrial machinery and equipment (Computers)</td><td>320</td><td>17.01</td><td></td><td>78</td><td>4.15</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td colspan=\"2\">Electronic and other electric equipment (Telecom)</td><td>355</td><td>18.87</td><td>1986</td><td>85</td><td>4.52</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td colspan=\"2\">Transportation equipment</td><td>45</td><td>2.39</td><td>1987</td><td>69</td><td>3.67</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td colspan=\"2\">Instruments and related products</td><td>247</td><td></td><td>1988</td><td>83</td><td>4.41</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td colspan=\"2\">Miscellaneous manufacturing industries</td><td></td><td>13.13</td><td>1989</td><td>86</td><td>4.57</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>43</td><td>2.29</td><td>1990</td><td>55</td><td>2.92</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>1991</td><td>24</td><td>1.28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>1992</td><td>42</td><td>2.23</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>1993</td><td>34</td><td>1.81</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>1994</td><td>31</td><td>1.65</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>1995</td><td>76</td><td>4.04</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>1996</td><td>69</td><td>3.67</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>1997</td><td>93</td><td>4.94</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>1998</td><td>145</td><td>7.71</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>1999</td><td>94</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2000</td><td>90</td><td>4.78</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table reports the distribution of two-digit SIC industry codes and the year of the first round of VC financing for U.S. VC-backed manufacturing firms from the VentureXpert database matched to the LRD. Any investment made by VC funds for buyout or acquisition purposes or where the purpose of the first round of investment was unknown or missing in the VentureXpert database was removed from the sample prior to the matching. The sample period is from 1972to 2000.  \n\nFurthermore, since the objective of our article is to analyze the impact of VC investments in private entrepreneurial firms, we also identify all public firms (as defined by CRSP) for every year in our sample and remove them from the LRD by using a similar matching approach as before. Thus, in any given year within our sample, we are left with only private firms, all of which could potentially receive VC funding, giving us a sample of 185,882 non-VC-backed firms, representing 771,830 firm-years of data. 13, 14  \n\n### 2.1 Measurement of total factor productivity (TFP)  \n\nThe primary measure of firm efficiency used in our analysis is total factor productivity (TFP), which is calculated from the LRD for each individual plant at the annual four-digit (SIC) industry level as in Chemmanur, He, and Nandy (2010). Firm-level TFP is then calculated as a weighted sum of plant TFP for each year. Increasingly, several articles in the finance and economics literature have used TFP to measure firm efficiency; see, e.g., Schoar (2002), Maksimovich and Philips (2008), Maksimovich and Philips (2001), McGuckin and Nguyen (1995), Lichtenberg and Siegel (1990), and Harris, Siegel, and Wright (2005), among others. We obtain measures of TFP at the plant level, by estimating a log-linear Cobb-Douglas production function for each industry and year. Industry is defined at the level of four-digit SIC codes.15 Individual plants are indexed $i$ ,industries $j$ ,for eachyear $t$ in the sample:  \n\n$$\n\\ln{(Y_{i j t})}=\\alpha_{j t}+\\beta_{j t}\\ln{(K_{i j t})}+\\gamma_{j t}\\ln{(L_{i j t})}+\\delta_{j t}\\ln{(M_{i j t})}+\\varepsilon_{i j t}.\n$$  \n\nWe use the LRD data to construct as closely as possible the variables in the production function. Output (Y) is constructed as plant sales (total value of shipments in the LRD) plus changes in the value of inventories for finished goods and work-in-progress.16 Since we appropriately deflate plant sales by the annual industry-specific price deflator, our measure should be proportional to the actual quantity of output.17  \n\nLabor input (L) is defined as production-worker-equivalent man-hours— that is, the product of production-worker man-hours, and the ratio of total wages and salaries to production-worker wages. We also reestimate the TFP regression by specifying labor input to separately include non-production workers, which yields qualitatively similar results. Values for capital stock (K) are generated by the recursive perpetual inventory formula. We use the earliest available book value of capital as the initial value of net stock of plant capital (this is either the value in 1972, or the first year a plant appears in the LRD sample). These values are written forward annually with nominal capital expenditure (appropriately deflated at the industry level) and depreciated by the economic depreciation rate at the industry level obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Since values of all these variables are available separately for buildings and machinery, we perform this procedure separately for each category of assets. The resulting series are then added together to yield our capital stock measure.  \n\nFinally, material input (M) is defined as expenses for the cost of materials and parts purchased, resales, contract work, and fuel and energy purchased, adjusted for the change in the value of material inventories. All the variables are deflated using annual price deflators for output, materials, and investment at the four-digit SIC level from the Bartelsman and Gray National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Productivity Database.18 Deflators for capital stock are available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.1\" Plant-level TFP is then computed as the residuals of regression (1), estimated separately for each year and each four-digit SIC industry. Therefore, the average TFP (i.e., the average of the residuals) in any four-digit SIC industry-year is zero by construction. Plant-level TFP measures are then aggregated to the firm level by a value-weighted approach, where the weight on a plant is the ratio of its output (total value of shipments) to the total output of the firm.20 The firm-level TFP is then winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles.  \n\n### 2.2 Intuitive interpretation, advantages, and limitations of TFP  \n\nTFP growth measures the residual growth in a firm's output after accounting for the growth in output attributable to the various factors of production and the production technology in place. In other words, an increase in TFP is an increase in the overall productivity (efficiency) of the firm, since more output can now be produced than earlier, with each of the factors of production remaining the same. Intuitively, TFP can be understood as the difference between the actual output produced by a plant compared with its “predicted output.\" This “predicted output’ is what the plant would have produced, given the amount of inputs it used and the industry production technology in place. Hence, a plant that produces more than the predicted amount of output in any given year has a greater than average productivity for that year, whereas a plant that produces less than the predicted amount of output in any given year has a lower than average productivity for that year. Thus, TFP can be interpreted as the relative productivity rank of a plant within its industry in any given year. A positive TFP implies that the plant is above average within its industry in that year, while a negative TFP implies that the plant is below average within its industry in that year. Since these regressions include a constant term, TFP contains only the idiosyncratic part of plant productivity. Note that firms having zero output will also be in our sample; these firms will have negative TFP.  \n\nBy now, TFP has been used in the finance and economics literature as the appropriate measure of firm efficiency in various contexts. In particular, there is an established literature on corporate restructuring that relies on TFP measures (see, e.g., Schoar 2002; Maksimovich and Philips 2008; McGuckin and Nguyen 1995; Lichtenberg and Siegel 1990; Maksimovich and Philips 2001; Harris, Siegel, and Wright 2005). Similar to entrepreneurial firms, many firms undergoing restructuring (especially leveraged buyouts) also go through a number of years in which costs exceed revenues (i.e., these firms have zero or negative profits). While the cost structure in restructuring is not identical to the case of entrepreneurial firms, the underlying logic is similar. In terms of using TFP as an efficiency measure to study young entrepreneurial firms, the article that is closest to ours is Chemmanur, He, and Nandy (2010), who use TFP as their primary measure of firm efficiency in analyzing the goingpublic decision of private firms and how it is related to their product market characteristics.  \n\nTFP has many advantages over other measures in capturing the efficiency of firms. In particular, venture capital financing involves the injection of additional capital into the firm, which may increase the scale of the firm and thus a mechanical increase in output. Therefore, TFP is a particularly appropriate measure to analyze the increase in firm performance due to VC backing, since it captures productivity changes after accounting for increases in the scale of production, which will not be captured by more traditional measures such as revenue or sales growth. TFP is also more flexible than cash-flow measures of performance, since it does not impose the restriction of constant returns to scale and constant elasticity of scale. Also, since coefficients on capital, labor, and material inputs can vary by industry and year, this specification allows for different factor intensities in different industries in different years. One significant benefit of this is that it allows for changes in technology in each industry over time.  \n\nOf course, the TFP measure also has some limitations. In particular, TFP is not an accounting measure, and we cannot directly link the TFP of a given firm to its profitability without additional assumptions. However, Schoar (2002) suggests a way of linking TFP to profits, which is as follows. Holding input costs constant, a certain percentage increase in productivity translates to an equal percentage increase in revenues, ceteris paribus. An increase in revenues leads to a more than proportional increase in profits, since the elasticity of profits to productivity is greater than one. Intuitively, an increase in productivity holding all else constant leads to higher revenues without changing costs. Since profits are revenues minus costs, the smaller the profit margin, the higher the elasticity of profits to productivity.  \n\n### 2.3 Other variables used in our analysis  \n\nIn this subsection, we discuss the construction and measurement of the different firm-specific variables as well as other proxies used in our analysis. The LRD contains detailed information at the plant level on the various production function parameters, such as total value of shipment, employment, labor costs, material costs, new capital investment for the purchase of buildings, machinery, equipment, etc. Using this detailed information, we first construct the variables of interest at the plant level, and then aggregate the plant level information to firm-level measures.  \n\nCapital Stock is constructed via the perpetual inventory method, discussed in Section 2.1. We measure Firm Age as the natural logarithm of one plus the number of years since the first plant of the firm first appeared in the LRD.21 Sales is defined as the total value of shipment in thousands of dollars. Capital Expenditure is the dollar value the firm spends on the purchase and maintenance of plant, machinery, and equipment, etc. Material Cost is the expense for the cost of materials and parts purchased, resales, contract work, and fuel and energy purchased. Rental and Administrative Expenditure is the rental payments or equivalent charges made during the year for the use of  \n\nHowDoes Venture Capital Financing ImproveEffciency in PrivateFirms?  \n\nbuildings, structures, and various office equipment. Salaries and Wages is the total production-worker wages plus total non-production-worker wages plus total supplemental labor costs, which include both legally required supplemental labor costs as well as voluntary supplemental labor costs of the firms. Total Production Cost is calculated as the sum of materials cost plus rental and administrative expenditures plus salaries and wages. All the dollar values in the LRD are in thousands of dollars (in 1998 real terms), and all the plant-level measures are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles.  \n\nWe define Firm Size as the natural logarithm of capital stock of the firm. Market Share is defined as thefirm's market shareinterms of sales at the annual three-digit SIC level. We use the market share of the firm to proxy for the firm's industry leader position. We construct the industry Herfindahl Index based on the market share measure of each firm in the LRD. The Herfindahl index is calculated by summing up the square of each firm's market share (in sales) at the annual three-digit SIC level. A higher Herfindahl index means that the industry is more concentrated. Industry Risk is defined as the standard deviation of total firm sales calculated over the prior five-year period in the same three-digit SIC industry. We define High Tech Firms as firms belonging to the following three-digit SIC codes: 357, 366, 367, 372, 381, 382, and 384. We also control for the Number of Plants in a firm defined as the number of plants belonging to the firm in that particular year. In order to control for overall equity market conditions, we use S&P 500 Returns, which is defined as the annual return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.  \n\nIn each year, we define VC reputation using the market share of the amount of funds raised by the VC over the prior five-year rolling window, following Megginson and Weiss (1991). We think this measure accurately captures VC reputation, since reputation is primarily built on past success and VCs will be able to raise greater follow-on funds only if the performance of their prior existing funds has been successful. This is because limited partners will be more willing to invest money when a fund has been more successful in the past. In a recent article, Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jorgensen (2008) provide direct empirical evidence showing that both the probability of raising a follow-on fund and the size of the follow-on fund increase in the return that investors earned in the previous fund of the same VC, thus suggesting that more successful VCs are able to raise larger follow-on investments.22 For each VC-backed firm in our sample, we then calculate the average reputation of the VC syndicate that provides the first round of VC financing to that firm. High Reputation corresponds to the average market share of funds raised by the VC syndicate being above the sample median, while Low Reputation corresponds to the average market share of funds raised being below the sample median.23 For robustness, we also use alternative measures of VC reputation based on the market share of the total amount of investment made by the VC firm and the market share of the market capitalization of IPO exits (on the first trading day) of the VC's portfolio firms (relative to all VC-backed IPOs) over a five-year rolling window (see Ivanov, Krishnan, Masulis, and Singh 2010 and Nahata 2008 for two papers using the IPO-based measure).24  \n\nIn addition to the firm-specific and industry-wide controls mentioned above, we also use several variables as instruments in our switching regression analysis (which we discuss in detail below). The set of instruments we use to capture the potential demand for VC funds from entrepreneurial firms relates to the increase in National Science Foundation (NSF) grants (in real terms) to applied and basic research.25 Our intuition is that an increase in NSF Research Grants could lead to an increase in the establishment of new entrepreneurial firms that may then potentially seek VC investment. To identify the potential supply of VC funds, we use the number of limited partners (LPs), defined as the total number of limited partners investing in VC funds that exist over the previous five years. Using a similar logic, we also use the fraction of the number of LPs in the past five years that are located in the state of the company to capture the potential heterogeneity in the supply of entrepreneurial funds. The greater the availability of LPs and the more of the LPs that are in geographic proximity to the company, the greater should be the ability of local VCs to raise financing, and thus, the greater should be the likelihood of VC backing. This is somewhat similar to the instrument used in Samila and Sorenson (2010, 2011), who use endowment returns of colleges and universities in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as their instrument for VC investment in that MSA. In addition, the AAA Spread, which is the spread of AAA bonds over five-year Treasury bonds, captures the investment alternatives available to investors that may invest in VC funds. An increase in the spread may lead to a decline in commitments to VC funds, thus lowering overall VC investments. We discuss the significance of using these instruments for our analysis later on in the article.  \n\n## 3. Do Venture Capitalists Improve Firm Efficiency?  \n\n### 3.1 Descriptive statistics  \n\nAs mentioned earlier, the sample of VC-backed firms used in this study comprises all private firms in the LRD that received VC funding between the years 1972 and 2000. In order to benchmark the effect of VC financing properly, we also include in our sample all private firms in the LRD that did not receive VC financing. Panel A of Table 2 presents the summary statistics (means and quasi-medians) of firm characteristics for both VC-backed and non-VC-backed private firms in the LRD during our sample period.26 We find that VC-backed firms in our sample are on average larger than non-VCbacked firms, in terms of asset value, sales, and total employment. In terms of asset value, VC-backed firms are on average seven times larger than nonVC-backed firms, while the average sales of VC-backed firms is about six times larger than that of non-VC-backed firms. Total cost of materials and total salaries and wages for VC-backed firms are also larger (on average about 5.5 times) than those of non-VC-backed firms, consistent with the argument made by Puri and Zarutskie (2009) regarding the importance of scale in VC financing. In addition, as suggested by anecdotal evidence and several prior papers, we also find that a greater proportion of high-tech firms are VC financed. We find that VCs on average invest in industries that have a higher volatility of firm sales over the past five years, suggesting that VCs tend to invest more in industries that are inherently riskier, and thus the potential contribution that the VC can make to the ultimate success of firms in such an industry is also significantly greater. Finally, we show that the median age at which firms receive their first round of VC financing is three years.  \n\nIn order to address the potentially unbalanced nature of the LRD sample, we present further summary statistics for our VC-backed sample of firms in Panel B of Table 2. Specifically, we look at VC-backed firms that received their first round of VC financing in census years (i.e., in the years 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997) and compare them with VC-backed firms that received their first round of financing in non-census years. The intuition for this test is as follows: Since the entire universe of manufacturing plants is included in census years, the average VC-backed firm in these years would be significantly smaller in size if indeed there is a significant discrepancy in the coverage of smaller VC-backed firms in non-census years. If it were so, one could argue that we are unable to identify smaller VC-backed firms in non-census years. The results of Panel B, however, rule out this concern, since we find that firms that receive VC financing in census years are not smaller than firms that receive VC financing in non-census years. We use various measures for size such as total assets, total sales, total employment, total salaries and wages, market share, etc., and do not find any statistically significant difference between the size of firms receiving VC financing in census years and the size of firms receiving VC financing in non-census years.

Total Sales is the total value of shipments in thousands of dollars. Materials Cost is the expenses for the cost of materials and parts purchased, resales, contract work, and fuel and energy purchased, in thousands of dollars. Salaries and Wages is the sum of total salaries and wages of the firm in thousands of dollars.Firm Age at VC Financing is the number of years since the firm first appeared in the LRD sample to the year of first round of VC financing. High-Tech Firm is the percentage of firms in the sample that are high-tech companies (i.e.,belonging to three-digit SIC codes 357,366,367, 372,381,382,or 384).Herfindahl Index is a measure of concentration of the firm's three-digit SIC industry. Industry Risk is the standard deviation of total value of shipments calculated over the prior five-year period in the same three-digit SIC industry as the sample firm. Firm Market Share is the firm's market share in terms of sales in the same three-digit SIC industry. To comply with the U.S. Census Bureau confidentiality requirements, we report Quasi-Medians, which are the average of the forty-third and the fifty-seventh percentile for each variable. All observations are at the firm-year level. \\*\\* \\*\\*, and \\* represent statistical significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels,respectively. Statistical significance for differences of means and quasi-medians differences correspond to $t$ -tests and rank-sum tests, respectively. Panel A reports statistics for VC- versus non-VC-backed firms. Panel B reports statistics in the year of receiving VC financing for VC-backed firms that received VC financing in census years (1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997) compared with those that received VC financing in non-census years. Variables are winsorized at the $1\\%$ and $99\\%$ levels.  \n\nsupport to the fact that our analysis uses a representative sample of VC-backed firms within the manufacturing sector and that our results are not driven by the presence of larger VC-backed firms in our sample.  \n\n### 3.2 The impact of venture capital financing on firm TFP: Differences in TFP dynamics around the first year of VC financing  \n\nIn our subsequent analysis, we use TFP as a comprehensive index of firm efficiency. First, we analyze the productivity of VC-backed firms relative to that of non-VC-backed firms. Second, we document the dynamic pattern of productivity changes from before to after the first round of VC financing, benchmarked against firms not receiving VC financing, and attempt to disentangle the impact on TFP arising due to VC screening prior to funding from that arising due to monitoring activities of VCs subsequent to funding.27 We employ a regression framework to analyze these effects, where we include firm and year fixed effects that allow us to precisely control for differences between firms and across time, respectively. Firm fixed effects control for unobserved heterogeneity when this heterogeneity is constant over time and essentially removes this effect by demeaning the regression variables, thereby removing any time-invariant firm-specific unobservable characteristics that may affect the dependent and independent variables in the regression (see, e.g., Wooldridge 2002, pp. 254, 265-74). As a result, while the coefficients in an ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression without firm fixed effects would include the effects of unobserved time-invariant firm characteristics, coefficients in a fixed effects regression would exclude the effect of these characteristics, thus providing a cleaner measure of how VC backing affects the variables under study. As VC financing of firms is distributed over time, we allow for the staggering of the events in our regressions. We also control for time-varying observables of the firm and industry. The methodology adopted in our regression framework throughout this article is consistent with that suggested by Petersen (2009), who advocates using fixed effects and adjusting the standard errors for correlations within clusters. In all regressions, we report standard errors clustered at the firm level. We implement this approach through the following regressions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{Y_{i t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta_{i}+\\gamma X_{i t}+\\delta V C A f t e r_{i t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}}\\ &{Y_{i t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta_{i}+\\gamma X_{i t}+\\delta_{1}V C B e f o r e_{-4,0}+\\delta_{2}V C A f t e r_{1,4}}\\ &{\\qquad+\\delta_{3}V C A f t e r_{\\geq5}+\\varepsilon_{i t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\nY_{i t}=\\alpha_{t}+\\beta_{i}+\\gamma X_{i t}+\\sum_{s=0}^{-4}\\delta_{1}^{s}V C B e f o r e_{i t}^{s}+\\sum_{s=1}^{\\geq5}\\delta_{2}^{s}V C A f t e r_{i t}^{s}+\\varepsilon_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y_{i t}$ is our variable of interest (i.e., firm TFP); $X_{i t}$ is a control for firm size and the industry Herfindahl index, which are time varying; $V C A f t e r_{i t}$ in (2) is a dummy variable, which equals one if the firm received VC financing and the observation is in a year after the first round of financing and zero if it either is a firm that did not receive VC financing or is a VC-backed firm, but with the observation belonging to a year prior to the first round of VC financing.28 In (3), we introduce $V C B e f o r e_{-4,0}$ , which is a dummy variable that equals one if the firm received VC financing and the observation is within five years prior to the first round of financing and zero otherwise. Conceptually, this variable is similar to the $V C A f t e r_{i t}$ variable and captures the difference in the TFP between VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms in the years prior to receiving VC financing. We also decompose the $V C A f t e r_{i t}$ variable into two parts: $V C A f t e r_{1,4}$ captures the changes from years 1 to 4 subsequent to the first round of financing, and $V C A f t e r_{\\geq5}$ captures the effect on TFP from the fifth year after the first round of financing until exit. This allows us to address how the changes brought about by the VC financing are distributed over time around the first year of receiving VC financing. In order to shed more light on the year-by-year changes in firm TFP due to VC financing, we estimate (4), where we decompose both the $V C B e f o r e_{i t}$ and $V C A f t e r_{i t}$ dummies separately for each year. For example, $V C A f t e r_{i t}^{s}$ equals one if the firm receives VC financing and the observation is $s$ years after the first round of financing, where $s=1,2,3,4$ , and ${\\ge}5.^{29}$ The dynamic pattern of the effect of VC financing on TFP is captured by the coefficients $\\delta^{\\prime}s$ in all three equations. In all specifications, $i$ indexes firms, $t$ indexes years, $\\beta_{i}$ are firm fixed effects, and $\\alpha_{t}$ are year fixed effects. The above specifications are estimated on the entire panel of private firms in the LRD including firms that received VC funding and those that did not. It should, however, be noted that the above fixed effects methodology may not properly capture the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing, if VCs have private information about the firms they invest in and particularly if such information is correlated with future TFP increases. We therefore use two alternative methodologies later on to analyze the causal effect of VC financing on TFP growth (due to the monitoring activities of VCs).  \n\nPanel A of Table 3 presents the results showing the effect of VC monitoring and screening on firm TFP. Our estimate of the effect of VC monitoring on a firm's TFP is captured by the ${\\delta}_{2}^{\\prime}s$ (the coefficients on VCAfter), and the effect of VC screening on a firm's TFP is captured by the $\\delta_{1}^{\\prime}s$ (the coeffcients on VCBefore).30 As can be seen from Table 3, VCs actively engage in both screening and monitoring. Regression 2 and Regression 3 in Panel A of Table 3 show that, on average, firms financed by VCs have $7\\%$ higher TFP over the five years prior to receiving funding, compared with firms that do not obtain VC financing, indicating that VCs actively screen firms prior to funding and select the ones with higher levels of productivity. Furthermore, subsequent to funding, TFP of VC-backed firms improves even further, on average to $12\\%$ over the next four years, over and above that of non-VC-backed firms, suggesting that VCs actively monitor their investments and improve the performance and efficiency of firms they fund. Finally,  \n\nRegression 4 decomposes the screening and monitoring effects dynamically for every year around the first round of VC funding. As can be seen from the results, for every year prior to receiving funding, VC-backed firms outperform non-VC-backed firms. While there is no apparent trend over the years prior to receiving funding, on average these firms had higher TFP of around $7\\%$ relative to non-VC firms, similar to the earlier results. After receiving funding, we observe an increasing trend of TFP for VC-backed firms for five years after the first round of financing, suggesting that the involvement of VCs and their monitoring of these firms leads to an increase in the TFP of these firms over and above that of non-VC-backed firms. This increase is more pronounced after  \n\nTable3 TFP dynamics around year of VC financing PanelA:Regression Results for TFP Changes overTime   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(7)</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter</td><td>0.121***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCBefore(-4,0)</td><td>[0.030]</td><td>0.068***</td><td>0.068***</td><td></td><td>0.067***</td><td>0.067***</td><td>0.069***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>[0.021] 0.120***</td><td>[0.021]</td><td></td><td>[0.021] 0.118***</td><td>[0.021] 0.118***</td><td>[0.021] 0.122***</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(-1,4)</td><td></td><td>[0.032]</td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.032]</td><td>[0.032]</td><td>[0.032]</td></tr><tr><td>VCBefore(-4)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.042* [0.022]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCBefore(-3)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.088*** [0.025]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCBefore(-2)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.086***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCBefore(-1)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.026]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.053* [0.027]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCBefore(0)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.071**</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.030]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(1)</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.108***</td><td>0.108***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.034]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(2)</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.106***</td><td>[0.035] 0.106***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.035]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(3)</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.13***</td><td>[0.035]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.035]</td><td>0.13***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(4)</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.136***</td><td>[0.035]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.039]</td><td>0.137***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(≥ 5)</td><td></td><td>0.188***</td><td>0.189***</td><td>[0.039]</td><td>0.186***</td><td></td><td>0.190***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>[0.042]</td><td>[0.042]</td><td>0.189*** [0.043]</td><td></td><td>0.185***</td><td>[0.042]</td></tr><tr><td>Firm Age</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.042] -0.006*</td><td>[0.042]</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.001</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firm Age Squared</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>[0.003]</td><td>[0.006]</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.005 [0.232]</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firm Size</td><td>-0.057***</td><td>-0.057***</td><td>-0.057***</td><td>-0.057***</td><td>-0.056***</td><td>-0.056***</td><td>-0.057***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.003]</td><td>[0.003]</td><td>[0.003]</td><td>[0.003]</td><td>[0.003]</td><td>[0.003]</td><td>[0.003]</td></tr><tr><td>Herfindahl Index</td><td>-0.019</td><td>-0.018</td><td>-0.018</td><td>-0.018</td><td>0.019</td><td>0.019</td><td>-0.018</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.020]</td><td>[0.020]</td><td>[0.020]</td><td>[0.020]</td><td>[0.020]</td><td>[0.020]</td><td>[0.020]</td></tr><tr><td>Firm Fixed Effects</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>YearFixed Effects</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>Firm Age Fixed Effects</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>524806</td><td>524806</td><td>524806</td><td>524806</td><td>524806</td><td>524806</td><td>524806</td></tr><tr><td>Adj.

The independent variables in Panel A are VCAfter, which is a dummy variable that equals one for years after the firm gets the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise; VCBefore(-4,0), which is a dummy variable that equals one for years $^{-4}$ to O prior to obtaining the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise; VCAfter(1,4), which is a dummy variable that equals one for years 1 to 4 after obtaining the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise; VCBefore(-t) for all $0\\leq t\\leq4$ which equals one in year $t$ before VC financing and zero otherwise; VCAfter(t) for all $O\\leq t\\leq4$ which equals onein year $t$ after VC financing and zero otherwise; $V C A f t e r(\\geq5)$ ,which equals one in or after year 5 of VC financing and zero otherwise; Firm Size, which is the natural log of the firm's capital stock in a given year; Herfindahl Index, which is the concentration of the firm's three-digit SIC industry; Firm Age, which is the natural logarithm of the number of years since the firm first appeared in the LRD sample; Firm Age Squared, which is the square of the log of age; and year, firm, and age fixed effects. Panel A reports the regression coefficient estimates and their statistical significances. Panel B reports TFP changes over various time periods and their statistical significances. Heteroscedasticity corrected robust standard errors, which are clustered on firms, are in brackets.All regressions are estimated with an intercept term. \\*\\*,\\*, and \\* represent statistical significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\n5 years (and beyond) of receiving funding when the TFP for VC-backed firms increasesto about $19\\%$ above that of non-VC-backed firms. In most cases, the coefficients of interest in Regression I to Regression $^{4}$ are significant at the $1\\%$ level. In Regressions 5, 6, and 7, we control for log of firm age, log of firm age squared, and age dummies, respectively. We find similar results after controlling for firm age, suggesting that our results are robust to controlling for life-cycle effects.  \n\nPanel B of Table 3 presents the net effect on firm TFP that can be attributed to the monitoring abilities of VCs. Based on Regression 2 to Regression 4, we find that the average increase in TFP from before receiving VC financing to four years after receiving VC financing is around $5\\%$ for VC-backed firms.  \n\nThis increase is around $12\\%$ for VC-backed firms when we compute the difference in TFP after year 5. In Regression 4, we compute the net effect of monitoring year by year for VC-backed firms relative to the year prior to receiving financing. Consistent with the evidence presented so far, we observe that there is a monotonically increasing effect of VC monitoring on TFP. In the two years after the first financing round, the impact of monitoring is around $5.5\\%$ , which monotonically increases to_ around $14\\%$ after the fifth year subsequent to the first round of financing.31 Overall, the results from Panels A and B of Table 3 suggest that VCs actively engage in both screening and monitoring. On average, we find that due to their screening ability, VCs invest in firms that have around $7\\%$ higher TFP than firms that do not receive VC funding. We also find that the net effect of monitoring on the TFP of firms is between $5.5\\%$ and around $14\\%$ . Thus, our results suggest that the impact of screening and monitoring of VCs on firm performance and efficiency are both important and on average they have similar magnitudes, if we consider solely the net effect of monitoring during the first two years after receiving the first round of financing. Our results on the change in TFP from before to after VC financing are also robust to age or life-cyle effects, which we control for in Regressions 5, 6, and 7. Overall, the results presented here are economically significant.32  \n\nAs a robustness check for our results,we use alternative measures of performance. We use value added per worker or labor productivity, which is defined as total sales divided by the number of workers. In addition, we also use ROA, defined as total sales minus production costs divided by firm capital stock, as another alternative measure of performance to check our results. These measures do not have the desirable theoretical properties of TFP, but they do have familiar statistical properties, since they are not computed from a regression. We find qualitatively similar results using labor productivity and ROA to those using TFP.33 In our analysis, failed firms will drop out of the  \n\nHowDoesVenture CapitalFinancing ImproveEfficiencyinPrivateFirms?  \n\nsample. However, any survivorship bias as a result of this is unlikely to drive our results. This is because even though firms that fail drop out of our sample, we find that non-VC-backed firms are more likely to fail than VC-backed firms. Thus, any survivorship bias would make the performance of non-VC-backed firms appear better, thus biasing the analysis against our findings.34 To further alleviate concerns that our results are driven by potential survivorship biases, we remove all firms that fail within our sample period (both VC- and non-VC-backed), and repeat our TFP analysis on this restricted sample. In other words, we run our analysis with firms that survive throughout the sample period. Our results are qualitatively similar to the ones reported here when we use this restricted sample.  \n\nThe above results are consistent with prior articles in the literature that argue that VCs create value through screening and monitoring, such as Lerner (1995) and Hellmann and Puri (2000, 2002). Our results complement these earlier studies and present direct evidence regarding the impact of such activities of VCs on firm performance and efficiency over and above that of non-VCbacked private firms. In particular, this is the first study to directly relate the productivity of VC-backed firms to that of non-VC-backed firms both prior to and after receiving VC financing, thus quantifying the impact on firm TFP due toVC involvement.  \n\n### 3.3 TFP dynamics for early- and late-stage venture capital-backed firms  \n\nA potential concern with our analysis is that our sample of VC-backed manufacturing firms may be biased toward later-stage VC-backed firms, and thus our results may not be generalizable to early-stage VC-backed firms.35 To address this concern, we run our fixed effect regressions separately on the set of early- and late-stage VC-backed firms. Early-stage firms are firms whose stage at the first round of VC financing is defined in SDC VentureXpert as “Early stage\" or “Seed/Startup.\" Table 4 reports the results of the fixed effects regressions for the set of early- and late-stage VC-backed firms. We find that the results for early- and late-stage VC-backed firms are similar to the regression results for the overall sample. Further, the monitoring impact of venture capitalists is stronger for early-stage VC-backed firms: The increase in TFP over the four years after receiving VC financing from the five years prior to receiving VC financing is statistically significant only for the sample of early-stage VC-backed firms. The economic magnitude of TFP increases from before to after VC financing is greater for early-stage VC-backed firms compared with those for late-stage VC-backed firms.  \n\nTable4 TFP dynamics around year of VC financing for early- and late-stage firms PanelA:RegressionResultsforTFPChanges overTime   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Early-stage</td><td>Late-Stage</td></tr><tr><td>VCBefore(-4,0)</td><td>0.067* [0.039]</td><td>0.08*** [0.023]</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(1,4)</td><td>0.201*** [0.069]</td><td>0.108*** [0.028]</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(≥5)</td><td>0.313*** [0.095]</td><td>0.16***</td></tr><tr><td>Firm Size</td><td>-0.064***</td><td>[0.03] -0.065***</td></tr><tr><td>HerfindahlIndex</td><td>[0.003] -0.013</td><td>[0.002] -0.016</td></tr><tr><td>YearFixedEffects</td><td>[0.017] Y</td><td>[0.016] Y</td></tr><tr><td>FirmFixedEffects</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>515581</td><td>520728</td></tr><tr><td>Adj.R2</td><td>0.423</td><td>0.423</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B:TFP Changes over Time   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>VCAfter(1,4)-VCBefore(4,0)</td><td>0.133***</td><td>0.028</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.466]</td><td>[0.018]</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(≥5)-VCBefore(4,0)</td><td>0.246</td><td>0.080***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.073]</td><td>[0.029]</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports results for panel data regressions where the dependent variable is the TFP of a firm for a given year. The regression results are reported for subsamples of early- and late-stage firms, where an early-stage firm is a firm that receives first round of VC financing at the “Early” or \"Startup/seed” stage, based on VentureXpert classification. The independent variables in Panel A are VCBefore(-4,O), which is a dummy variable that equals one for years $^{-4}$ to O prior to obtaining the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise; VCAfter(1,4), which is a dummy variable that equals one for years 1 to 4 after obtaining the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise; $V C A f t e r(\\geq5)$ ,which equals one in or after year 5 of VC financing and zero otherwise; Firm Size, which is the natural log of the firm's capital stock in a given year; Herfindahl Index, which is the concentration of the firm's three-digit SIC industry; and firm and year fixed effects. Panel A reports the regression coefficient estimates and their statistical significances. Panel B reports TFP changes over various time periods and their statistical significances.

Rather, the economic effect of VC monitoring on firm TFP is greater in the sample of early-stage VC-backed firms.36  \n\n### 3.4 The effect of option compensation on TFP dynamics  \n\nHellmann and Puri (2002) argue that VCs introduce option-based compensation in the firms that they back. Thus, a potential concern with our TFP results above is that our TFP calculations understate the magnitude of option compensation, which in turn might mechanically bias our TFP measure  \n\nHowDoesVentureCapital FinancingImproveEfficiency inPrivateFirms?  \n\nupward, particularly for VC-backed firms. To alleviate this concern, we perform an adjustment to our TFP measure.37 Using aggregate industrylevel option compensation data, we adjust the labor input in the CobbDouglas production function to refect the greater expense of providing option compensation. In particular, we adjust the salaries and wages of white-collar employees in VC-backed firms, starting from the year in which they receive VC financing, upward by a factor that is equal to one plus the ratio of average options to cash compensation in the year and three-digit SIC industry of the VC-backed firm. We do not adjust the labor input for the non-VC-backed firms or for VC-backed firms in the years prior to receiving VC financing, thus biasing the analysis against finding higher TFP growth for VC-backed firms. We then run our TFP calculation regressions, described in Section 2.1, using this adjusted labor input measure and calculate firm-level TFP as before.  \n\nWe obtain data on the stock options and compensation from the Execucomp database. Since this database only provides data from 1992 onward, we make two different assumptions about the option adjustment prior to 1992. In the first adjustment, we fix option compensation levels prior to 1992 at the 1992 level for each three-digit SIC industry. This is a conservative adjustment (since it lowers the TFP much more for VC-backed firms) because prior literature (e.g., Frydman and Saks 2010) suggests that option compensation levels had been steadily increasing over the 1980s and the 1990s. In the second adjustment, we calculate the average annual compounded growth rate of options in the years after 1992 for each three-digit SIC industry, and use this growth rate to decrease the option compensation adjustment backward from 1992.38 We also repeat this adjustment and TFP calculation using combined stock and option compensation.  \n\nOur results using the above adjusted TFP measures are reported in Table 5. They indicate that even after adjusting for option compensation, our results remain similar to the ones reported earlier. In particular, we find that VCbacked firms have higher TFP than non-VC-backed firms prior to the VC financing, and their option-adjusted TFP increases subsequent to investment by the VC. Our results hold for both types of pre-1992 option adjustment methods.39 Further, our results remain similar when we adjust for combined stock and option compensation. Thus, the results in this section mitigate concerns that our results may be driven by overstatement of the TFP due to not adjusting our labor measure appropriately for the introduction of option compensation in VC-backed firms.  \n\nTable5 Option- and stock-adjusted TFP dynamics around year of VC financing PanelA:RegressionResultsforTFPChangesoverTime   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Option adjusted, Fixed level pre-1992</td><td>Stock and Option adjusted, Fixed level pre-1992</td><td>Option adjusted, Declining level pre-1992</td><td>Stock and Option adjusted, Declining level pre-1992</td></tr><tr><td>VCBefore(-4,0)</td><td>0.06***</td><td>0.06***</td><td>0.06***</td><td>0.06***</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(1,4)</td><td>[0.019] 0.098***</td><td>[0.019] 0.095***</td><td>[0.019] 0.100***</td><td>[0.019] 0.098***</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(≥5)</td><td>[0.024] 0.118***</td><td>[0.024] 0.116***</td><td>[0.024] 0.118***</td><td>[0.024] 0.115***</td></tr><tr><td>Firm Size</td><td>[0.026] -0.062***</td><td>[0.026] -0.062***</td><td>[0.026] -0.062***</td><td>[0.026] -0.062***</td></tr><tr><td>HerfindahlIndex</td><td>[0.003]</td><td>[0.003]</td><td>[0.003]</td><td>[0.003]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.034 [0.023]</td><td>-0.034 [0.023]</td><td>-0.033 [0.023]</td><td>-0.033 [0.023]</td></tr><tr><td>YearFixedEffects</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>FirmFixedEffects</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>524402</td><td>524402</td><td>524402</td><td>524402</td></tr><tr><td>Adj.R2</td><td>0.381</td><td>0.381</td><td>0.381</td><td>0.381</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B:TFP Changes overTime   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>VCAfter(1,4)-VCBefore(4,0)</td><td>0.037*</td><td>0.035*</td><td>0.040**</td><td>0.038**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">VCAfter(≥5)-VCBefore(4,0)</td><td>[0.019]</td><td>[0.019]</td><td>[0.019]</td><td>[0.019]</td></tr><tr><td>0.058**</td><td>0.055**</td><td>0.058**</td><td>0.056**</td></tr><tr><td>[0.023]</td><td>[0.023]</td><td>[0.023]</td><td>[0.023]</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports results for panel data regressions in which the dependent variable is the TFP of a firm for a given year adjusted for option grants or stock and option grants.

We do this by estimating a modified version of (3) where we replace the VCAfter dummies with VCAfter Round dummies. Specifically, we look at TFP improvements after Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, and Round 4 or greater. The results are presented in Table 6. The round-by-round results, reported in Panel A of Table 6, are consistent with those discussed in the previous section and show that at each round after receiving financing and in the years prior to  \n\nPanelA:RegressionResultsforTFP Change overRounds  \n\nTable6 TFP dynamics around rounds of VC financing   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>VCBefore</td><td>0.057***</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(R1)</td><td>[0.020] 0.102***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.033]</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(R2)</td><td>0.192*** [0.048]</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(R3)</td><td>0.189***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.060]</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(≥R4)</td><td>0.155***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.046]</td></tr><tr><td>Firm Size</td><td>-0.057***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.003]</td></tr><tr><td>HerfindahlIndex</td><td>-0.016</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.020]</td></tr><tr><td>FirmFixedEffects</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>YearFixedEffects</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>523750</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Adj.R2</td><td>0.414</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B:TFP Change overRounds   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>VCAfter(R1)-VCBefore</td><td>0.045*</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(R2)-VCBefore</td><td>[0.026] 0.135*** [0.043]</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(R3)-VCBefore</td><td>0.131**</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(≥R4)-VCBefore</td><td>[0.056] 0.098**</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(R2)-VCAfter(R1)</td><td>[0.043]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.090** [0.039]</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(R3)-VCAfter(R2)</td><td>-0.004</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.060]</td></tr><tr><td>VCAfter(>R4)-VCAfter(R3)</td><td>-0.03</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.056]</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports results for panel data regressions in which the dependent variable is the TFP of a firm for a given year.The independent variables in the regression are VCBefore,which is a dummy variable that equals one for all years prior to the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise;VCAfter(Rl),which is a dummy variable that equals one for years after the first round but before the second round of VC financing and zero otherwise; VCAfter(R2), which is a dummy variable that equals one for years after the second round but before the third round of VC financing and zero otherwise;VCAfter(R3),which is a dummy variable that equals one for years after the third round but before the fourth round of VC financing and zero otherwise; $V C A f t e r(\\geq R4)$ ,which isa dummy variable that equals one for years after the fourth round of VC financing and zero otherwise; Firm Size, which is the natural log of the firm's capital stock in a given year; Herfindahl Index, which is the concentration of the firm's three-digit SIC industry; and firm and year fixed effects.Panel A reports the regression coefficient estimates and their statistical significances.Panel B reports TFP changes over various rounds and their statistical significances.Heteroscedasticity corrected robust standard errors,which are clustered on firms,are in brackets.

Additionally, the TFP in Round 2 (i.e., between round 2 and  \n\n3) is significantly greater than the TFP in Round $I$ (i.e., between round 1 and 2), suggesting a monotonic increase in TFP from round 1 until the end of round 2 for VC-backed firms. While the TFP improvement after Round 1 and before Round 2 is around $5\\%$ , the TFP improvement after Round 2 and before Round 3 is significantly greater at $9\\%$ . However, TFP after Round 3 is not significantly greater than the TFP before that round. This result therefore suggests that increases in TFP for VC-backed firms is achieved within the first couple of rounds of VC involvement with the firm.  \n\n## 4. Effect of VC Monitoring on TFP  \n\n### 4.1 Switching regressions with endogenous switching  \n\nIn this section, we present further evidence on the impact of monitoring by VCs on firm TFP and efficiency. Our results from the previous sections suggest that VCs screen firms and thus the VC-firm matching may be nonrandom. For instance, VCs may select higher-quality firms to invest in, leading to higher performance subsequent to VC investment. In other words, this matching may potentially confound the effects of VC monitoring on firm performance with the effects arising due to VC screening. Thus, to isolate the effect of VC monitoring, we are interested in the following “what-if' type of question: What would the performance of a VC-backed firm have been had it not received VC financing? Similarly, what would the performance of a non-VC-backed firm have been had it received VC financing? The answer to these questions holds the impact of screening on TFP constant and separates out the effect of monitoring on firm TFP due to VC financing.  \n\nTo implement this, we adopt a two-step Heckman-type estimation structure and employ a switching regression with endogenous switching methodology to disentangle the impact of screening and monitoring on TFP of VC-backed firms. This procedure is discussed in detail in Heckman (1979) and Maddala (1983) and is a generalized version of the traditional Heckman model and therefore accounts for the effect of unobservables (using which VCs may select better-quality firms) by using inverse Mills ratios. In particular, we use a firststage regression to predict the probability of VC backing and the inverse Mills ratios for VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms. The inverse Mills ratio has been used in the prior literature as a measure of unobserved factors that affect the selection of firms for treatment (which is VC financing in our context) as well as the outcome variable (which is post-VC financing TFP improvement in our context). Thus, the inverse Mills ratio captures unobservable information using which VCs may select better-quality firms. We then regress TFP growth on the inverse Mills ratio and control variables in the second stage of the estimation separately for VC- and non- VC- backed firms. Finally, the predicted values of TFP growth from the second-stage estimates are used to conduct the above-mentioned “what-if’ analysis. Thus, the switching regression analysis measures the effect of the treatment (i.e., VC backing) on the outcome variable (i.e., TFP growth) through a “what-if’ or counterfactual analysis rather than estimating it from a regression. This model appears in Lee (1978) in his study of unionism and wage rates, Dunbar (1995) in his study of the use of warrants as underwriter compensation, and more recently in Fang (2005) in her study on investment bank reputation and the price and quality of bond underwriting services provided by them. Please see the technical appendix (Appendix A) for a more detailed description of this methodology.  \n\nWe control for firm-level characteristics that could affect VC-firm matching, such as the average five-year prior TFP, firm size, the number of plants operated by the firm, firm age, market share, and whether the firm operates in a high-tech industry or not; industry-level characteristics such as the industry Herfindahl index and the riskiness of the industry in which the firm operates; marketwide characteristics such as the S&P 500 return; and time dummies capturing the 1980s, the 1990s, and the Internet-bubble period. In addition, we also include several instruments that are correlated with the demand and supply of venture funds in the economy but are independent of the future performance of VC-backed firms—namely, the increase in NSF applied research grants, the increase in NSF basic research grants, the total number of LPs, the fraction of total LPs in the same state as the entrepreneurial firm, and the AAA spread. These instruments provide us with exogenous variation in terms of both the supply of, and the demand for, VC funds that affect the selection equation (i.e., the matching outcome between VCs and entrepreneurial firms) but do not directly affect firm performance.  \n\nThe results of the switching regression analysis, reported in Panel A of Table 7, show that prior average TFP, firm size, number of plants operated by the firm, Herfindahl index, and the high-tech dummy are all positive and significant determinants of receiving VC financing. Firm age and industry risk are negative and significant determinants of VC financing. With regard to the instruments, we find that the coefficient on the increase in NSF applied research grants is positive and significant, while the coefficient on the increase in NSF basic research grants is negative, suggesting that greater applied research may lead to an increase in entrepreneurial firm formation, thus leading to greater demand for VC funds. Similarly, the coefficients on the number of LPs and the fraction of in-state LPs are also positive and significant, suggesting a greater probability of receiving VC funding in the presence of a greater number of LPs. As expected, the coefficient on AAA spread is negative and significant, suggesting that availability of funds to VCs is an important criterion for VC financing, consistent with Gompers and Lerner (1998). We then augment the second-stage regressions for VC-backed and non- VC-backed firms with the inverse Mills ratio calculated from the first stage to account for endogenous selection (based on unobservable factors).  \n\nThe second-stage results show that while the inverse Mills ratio is positive and significant for VC-backed firms, it is insignificant for non-VC-backed firms. This suggests that VCs may also use some unobservable factors when  \n\n1   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>DependentVariable:TFPGrowth Second-stage DependentVariable:VCBackingDummy First-stage</td><td>Non-VC-Backed Firms 0.921*** [0.009] 0.027*** [0.386] 0.035 VC-Backed Firms 0.212** -0.779*** ***8900 [0.086] [0.062] Average 5 Year Prior TFP Inverse Mills Ratio Firm Size 0.0004** 0.445*** 0.575* [0.000] [0.311] Increase in NSF Applied Research Grants Fraction of Instate LPs Number of LPs</td><td>[0.003] 0.002** -0.006*** [0.001] 0.214** [0.001] [0.023] [0.097] 0.0004 [0.0003] 0.031 -0.003 [0.023] 0.003 [0.002] 0.132*** [0.024] 0.000 [0.001] 0.086 [0.086] 0.002 [0.003] 0.066 [0.110] 0.001 [0.001] 0.081 [0.05] 0.009 [0.025] Firm Market Share Number of Plants Herfindahl Index S&P 500 Returns High-Tech Firm Industry Risk Firm Age -0.115** 0.093** 0.212*** 0.005*** [0.127] -0.442** [0.193] [0.048] [0.043] [0.012] 0.332* [0.194] -0.005** [0.001] [0.002] Increase in NSF Basic Research Grants Average 5 Year Prior TFP Number of Plants Herfindahl Index AAA Spread Firm Size Firm Age</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nnanno   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Non-VC-BackedF DependentVariable:TFPGrowth Second-stage VC-BackedFirms First-stage</td><td rowspan=\"2\"></td></tr><tr><td>292815 0.69 5714 0.665 Adj.R2 1234.9*** Chi2</td></tr><tr><td>0.231*** DependentVariable:VCBackingDummy [0.087] 80sDummy</td><td>Firm Fixed Effects Observations 0.296* 361334 -0.025 [0.157] [0.152] BubbleDummy 90sDummy Observations</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>High-Tech Firm, which is a dummy variable that takes the value 0 if the one-year lagged value of the firm's three-digit SIC code is 357, 366,367,372,381, 382, or 384; 1980s Dummy, which takes the value one for years between 1980 and 1989 and zero otherwise; 1990s Dummy, which takes the value one for years between 1990 and 1998 and zero otherwise; and Bubble representstatistical represent statistical significance at the1%,5%,and ，and 宗**宗家 thefirstroundofVCfinancing.T</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nHowDoesVenture CapitalFinancing ImproveEfficiencyinPrivateFirms?  \n\nthey select firms to invest in, and these factors (that they condition the selection on) positively affect the future TFP growth of firms receiving VC financing. Therefore, properly controlling for this effect enables us to attribute the residual TFP growth of VC-backed firms to the monitoring activities of VCs. We find that lower average prior TFP leads to higher future TFP growth in both VC- and non-VC-backed firms. While larger firms have higher future TFP growth among VC-backed firms, smaller firms, multi-plant firms, younger firms, and firms with greater market share have higher future TFP growth among non-VC-backed firms.  \n\nPanel B of Table 7 presents the results of our counterfactual analysis of VC-backed versus non-VC-backed firms. We obtain the counterfactual values of TFP growth for VC-backed firms as the predicted values of the non-VCbacked regression and the corresponding inverse Mills ratio (using VC-backed firm data), and vice versa. These results suggest that, on average, VC-backed firms achieve a TFP growth of approximately $18.5\\%$ higher than what the same firms would have achieved had they not received VC financing, suggesting a monitoring effect. The second row shows a hypothetical improvement in TFPgrowthof $4.3\\%$ for non-VC-backed firms had the same firms received VC financing. The magnitude of this improvement attributed to monitoring is consistent with our earlier results presented in Table 3 and is also both statistically and economically significant, since it corresponds to a $40\\%$ increase in profits after receiving VC financing.  \n\nIn summary, these results empirically show the impact of monitoring on firm efficiency and productivity. We explicitly account for the endogenous nature of the VC firm selection process using a Heckman-style two-stage model, and after controlling for this selection, we find VCs have a significant positive monitoring effect on the post-financing TFP of the firms that they invest in.  \n\n### 4.2 Regression discontinuity analysis  \n\nIn this section, we demonstrate the causal effect of venture capitalists on the productivity of the firms they invest in (i.e., monitoring) using a regression discontinuity (RD) approach. Specifically, we use the “fuzzy” RD technique discussed in Angrist and Lavy (1999) and Van der Klaauw (2002).40 Identification in a fuzzy RD technique comes from a discontinuous jump in the probability of treatment. We use a two-stage approach similar to the ones used in the above articles to implement our RD analysis. Our estimation equation is  \n\n$$\ny_{j}=x_{j}\\beta+\\delta I_{j}+\\varepsilon_{j},\n$$  \n\nwhere $y_{j}$ is the growth in the productivity of the firm, $I_{j}$ is the endogenous treatment variable, which in our case is a dummy equal to one for VC-backed firms in the year they obtain VC financing and zero otherwise, and $x_{j}$ is a set of control variables. The fuzzy RD approach requires an assignment variable $S_{j}$ such that $\\mathrm{Pr}\\big(I_{j}|S_{j}\\big)$ experiences a jump at a known point $S_{j}=S_{0}$ . Note that, unlike the endogenous switching regression approach used earlier, $S_{j}$ can be correlated with the test variable $y_{j}$ (which is TFP growth in our case). The restriction required for identification is that no other effect causes a jump in $y_{j}$ at $S_{j}=S_{0}$ . The regression discontinuity can be implemented with a two-stage approach. We first estimate  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pr}(I_{j}|S_{j})=\\phi.S_{j}+\\gamma.1\\{S_{j}\\geq S_{0}\\}+\\eta_{j},\n$$  \n\nwhere $1\\{S_{j}\\ge S_{0}\\}$ is an indicator function that equals one if $S_{j}\\geq S_{0}$ and zero otherwise, and $\\eta_{j}$ is the error term. We augment the second-stage equation with $\\mathrm{Pr}(I_{j}|S_{j})$ , which is calculated as the predicted probability from (6). The second-stage model is estimated as  \n\n$$\ny_{j}=x_{j}\\beta+\\delta\\operatorname*{Pr}(I_{j}|S_{j})+\\rho S_{j}+u_{j}.\n$$  \n\nThis approach is analogous to a two-stage least-squares approach, with the discontinuity $1\\{S_{j}\\ge S_{0}\\}$ serving as the identifying instrument.41  \n\nTo obtain the discontinuity to identify our system, we exploit the fact that the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) provides financial support to firms up to a certain size cutoff.42 For most industrial firms, the size cutoff is a prespecified level of employment that varies with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry affliation of the frm.43 Our assignment variable, $S_{j}$ , is the normalized level of employment in the firm-i.e.,  \n\nFirmEmployment $S_{j}=$ NormalizedEmployment= Employment Cutoff forSBA Support Eligibility.  \n\nThus, we expect a discontinuity in the propensity of firms to seek and obtain VC financing at $S_{j}=1$ . At all points below $S_{j}=1$ , firms are eligible for SBA support and therefore have a viable alternative to VC financing and are thus less likely to seek and obtain VC financing. At points above $S_{j}=1$ , firms are not eligible for SBA support, and as a result are more likely to seek and obtain VC financing.  \n\n![](images/5423a82923924732019dd5e587561f9b7dba56270999e8b3de71aa37bf2ac0b2.jpg)  \nFigure1 Discontinuity of the treatment (VC financing) when normalized employment=1  \n\nWe start by showing a graphical analysis of the discontinuity. Figure 1 graphs a kernel-weighted mean smoothing estimator of the propensity to obtain VC financing as a function of our assignment variable. The graph clearly indicates that there is indeed a jump in the propensity to obtain VC financing at the point where normalized employment equals one, as expected.  \n\nOne concern with the assignment variable may be that firms may try to obtain federal funding by artificially restricting their size levels to comply with SBA requirements. McCrary (2008) argues that such active sorting may undermine the identification requirements of the regression discontinuity design. To rule out this concern, we graphically and statistically analyze the density function of the normalized employment variable around the cutoff point (i.e., at $S_{j}{=}1$ ). Visual analysis of the graph indicates a smooth density function of $S_{j}$ at the cutoff point. We then conduct the statistical test recommended in McCrary (2008) to ensure that our identification strategy is valid. The test is implemented as a Wald test of the null hypothesis that the discontinuity in the density function of the assignment variable is zero at the cutoff point. The test does not find a statistically significant jump or drop in the density function of the assignment variable $S_{j}$ at the cutoff point, i.e., $S_{j}=1$ , thereby validating our identification strategy.44  \n\nTable8 Regression discontinuity analysis for VC and non-VC-backed firms   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">First-stage</td><td colspan=\"2\">Second-stage</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">DependentVariable:VCBackingDummy</td><td colspan=\"2\">DependentVariable:TFPGrowth</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Indicator (Norm.Emp.>1)</td><td>0.357***</td><td>VC BackingProb.(predicted)</td><td>1.325***</td></tr><tr><td>[0.046]</td><td></td><td>[0.453]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Average5YearPriorTFP</td><td>0.092**</td><td>Average 5YearPrior TFP</td><td>-0.906***</td></tr><tr><td>[0.041]</td><td></td><td>[0.009]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Norm.Employment</td><td>-0.001</td><td>Norm.

The first stage reports the results from a probit model in which the dependent variable is whether a firm gets VC financing in a given year (VC Backing Dummy). The time series for each firm that gets VC financing terminates in the year of obtaining the first round of VC financing.The independent variables in the regressions are Indicator(Norm.Emp. $>I$ ),which is a dummy variable that equals one if the one-year lagged ratio of the company's total employment to the maximum SBA size threshold to be eligible to receive support from the U.S.Small Business Administration (SBA)is greater than one, i.e.,the firm is ineligible to obtain support from the SBA, and zero otherwise; Norm. Employment, which is the one-year lagged ratio of the company's total employment to the maximum SBA size threshold to be eligible to receive support from the U.S. SBA; Average 5 year prior TFP, which is the average TFP over the past five years starting from the current year; Firm Size, which is the one-year lagged value of natural log of the firm's capital; Number of Plants, which is the natural logarithm of the one-year lagged value of the number of plants in the firm; Herfindahl Index, which is the one-year lagged value of the measure of concentration of the firm's three-digit SIC industry; Firm Age, which is the natural logarithm one-year lagged value of the number of years since the firm first appeared in the LRD sample; Firm Market Share, which is the one-year lagged value of the firm's market share in terms of sales in the same three-digit SIC industry; Industry risk, which is the one-year lagged value of the median standard deviation of the total value of shipments calculated over a prior five-year period for all firms in the same three-digit SIC industry as the sample firm; High-Tech Firm, which is a dummy variable that takes the value one if the one-year lagged value of the firm's three-digit SIC code is 357, 366, 367, 372, 381, 382, or 384; and year dummies. The dependent variable in the second-stage regression is the TFP Growth, which is defined as the difference between the average TFP over the next five years and the average TFP over the past five years starting from the current year. The independent variables in these regressions are the predicted VC backing probability from the first stage and all the independent variables from the first stage except forIndicator(Norm.Emp) $>I$ ). In the first-stage regression, heteroscedasticity corrected robust standard errors, which are clustered on firms, are in brackets, while in the second-stage regression bootstrapped standard errors, which are clustered on firms, are in brackets. All regressions are estimated with an intercept term. \\*\\*\\* \\*\\*, and \\*representstatistical significance athe $1\\%$ $5\\%$ ,and $10\\%$ levels,respectively.  \n\nThe results of the two-stage RD analysis are reported in Table 8. Consistent with our expectations, the coefficient estimate on the jump indicator (i.e., Indicator(Norm.Emp. $>1,$ ) is statistically significant and positive in the firststage regression, indicating that there is a jump in the propensity to obtain VC financing at the point where a firm outgrows its eligibility for SBA support. In the second stage, we find that the coefficient estimate on the predicted probability of VC financing from the first stage is positive and statistically significant. Thus, after controlling for the selection of firms by VCs using the regression discontinuity approach, we find that VC financing leads to higher levels of productivity growth. Our results are therefore consistent with the notion that VC monitoring leads to an increase in firm productivity.  \n\n### 4.3 Propensity score matching  \n\nIn this section, as an additional robustness check, we employ another methodology to confirm our earlier results on the effect of VC monitoring on subsequent growth in firm TFP. We employ a propensity score matching algorithm, where we match firms on multiple dimensions in the year prior to receiving VC financing. Specifically, we require that the matched firm be in the same three-digit SIC industry as the sample firm, be of similar size, and have a similar level of average prior TFP in the five years prior to receiving funding. The last criterion ensures that at the time of receiving VC financing, both our sample (VC-backed firms) and matched (non-VC-backed firms) portfolios have similar levels of productivity and efficiency.  \n\nTable 9 presents the results of the propensity score matching-based analysis. By construction, the average five-year TFP prior to receiving VC financing is similar and not statistically different between VC-backed and non- VC-backed matching firms. However, when we compare the TFP growth over the next five years for our two portfolios, we observe that while the VC-backed firms realize  \n\nTable9 Matched sample comparison of TFP growth after VC financing   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>Sample</td><td>Matched</td><td>Diff.</td></tr><tr><td>TFPGrowth</td><td>Mean</td><td>0.001***</td><td>-0.047</td><td>0.048*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>p-value</td><td>(0.007)</td><td>(0.959)</td><td>(0.051)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Quasi-median</td><td>0.001***</td><td>-0.040</td><td>0.041**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>p-value</td><td>(0.004)</td><td>(0.650)</td><td>(0.041)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Observations</td><td>558</td><td>558</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Average5YearPriorTFP</td><td>Mean</td><td>0.020</td><td>0.001</td><td>0.019</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>p-value</td><td>(0.949)</td><td>(0.341)</td><td>(0.460)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Quasi-median</td><td>0.040</td><td>0.010**</td><td>0.030</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>p-value</td><td>(0.773)</td><td>(0.012)</td><td>(0.150)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Observations</td><td>588</td><td>588</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports means and quasi-medians for TFP Growth, which is defined as the difference between the average TFP over the next five years and the average TFP over the last five years starting from the current year, and the Average 5YearPrior TFP, which is the average TFP over thelast five years starting from the current year. Quasi-medians are the average of theforty-third and thefifty-seventh percentilesfor eachvariable.Wereport quasi-medians rather than medians to comply with the U.S. Census Bureau confidentiality requirements. The matched sample is created using a propensity score-based matching methodology. Matched firms are selected such that it is in the same three-digit SIC industry in the year of the VC financing of the sample firm and has comparable capital stock and average 5-year prior TFP as the sample firm. $P$ -values are reported in parentheses. $P$ values for means and medians correspond to $t$ -tests and sign-tests, respectively, for the null hypothesis that themean and median are zero. $P$ -valuesfor differences in means and medians correspond to paired $t$ -tests and sign-rank tests. $^{\\mathrm{star}},^{\\mathrm{star}}$ , and $^*$ represent statistical significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nsignificantly positive TFP growth (both at the mean and the quasi-median), the matched sample of non-VC-backed firms do not. Moreover, the difference in TFP growth between the two groups of firms is statistically and economically significant, with the mean of the VC-backed firms being approximately $5\\%$ higher and the quasi-median being approximately $4\\%$ higher than the matched sample of non-VC-backed firms. Consistent with our earlier findings, this result also suggests that VC involvement improves the efficiency of VC-backed firms through the extra-financial monitoring services provided by the VCs, with the magnitude of this effect being similar to that documented in the earlier sections.  \n\nOne significant limitation of the propensity score matching analysis is that it does not control for the effect of unobservables on the selection of firms that get VC financing. Thus, we cannot entirely depend on the results in this section to demonstrate causality. We address the issue of unobservables using the switching regression and the regression discontinuity approaches discussed above.  \n\n## 5. The Channels Through Which VCs Improve Firm Efficiency  \n\nIn this section, we identify the channels through which efficiency improvements are realized for VC-backed firms compared with non- VC-backed firms. In order to do this, we investigate the dynamics of firm output as well as the various inputs (capital, materials, and labor) around the years of receiving the first round of VC financing, benchmarked against that of non- VCbacked firms. We implement this using the regression specification outlined in Equation (3), where our dependent variables in the various regressions are as identified in the column headings in Table 10. We control for firm size and include both firm and year fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the firm level. Panel A of Table 10 presents the regression results, while Panel B presents the changes in the dependent variables over time from before receiving VC financing to after receiving VC financing.  \n\nAs can be seen from the results, sales of VC-backed firms are larger prior to VC financing and increase significantly over time from before receiving financing to after receiving financing as compared with that of non-VC firms. This increase in sales is even more pronounced in year five and after receiving the first round of financing. Similar to this increase in total sales, our results also document increases in total production cost for firms from before receiving VC financing to after receiving financing. This increase in total production cost mainly arises from increases in materials cost. Compared to non-VC-backed firms, VC-backed firms have higher total labor cost prior to receiving financing, and total labor cost for VC-backed firms also increases subsequent to receiving VC financing. While materials cost increases monotonically after receiving VC funding, the increase in labor cost is evident only during the first four years after receiving VC financing; for five years and after VC financing, we do not find a significant difference in the growth of salaries and wages from before receiving financing. We also find no changes in the level of total employment growth from before receiving VC financing to after receiving financing. Finally, we document that while capital expenditure is greater for VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing compared with non- VC-backed firms, there is no significant change in capital expenditure for VC-backed firms from before receiving financing to after receiving financing. Hellmann and Puri (2002) find that venture capitalists help professionalize firm management. Our results, particularly higher wages after VC backing, are consistent with their results, suggesting that VC backing leads to the employment of higher-quality workers in firms. Moreover, materials costs increase subsequent to VC backing.  \n\nuuu jo pu y  puoe d o sdu jo su   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"6\">Log Total Employment 0.031 [0.029] 0.063* [0.034] Log Salaries & Wages 0.062** [0.028] Log Materials Cost 0.104*** [0.037] Log Capital Exp.

Further, the results are also consistent with the interpretation that VCs may be employing higher-quality workers in the years immediately after investing in the firm in order to improve their operating efficiency.  \n\n### 5. Differences Between High- and Low-reputation VC-backed Firms  \n\n### 6.1 Differences in TFP dynamics for high- and low-reputation VC-backedfirms  \n\nGiven the choice, entrepreneurs would prefer to source financing from highreputation VCs rather than from low-reputation VCs. Hsu (2004) points out that a financing offer from a high-reputation VC is approximately three times more likely to be accepted by an entrepreneur and also that high-reputation VCs get better deal terms (i.e., lower valuations) when negotiating with startups. This suggests that startup firms will be willing to accept such terms only if high-reputation VCs provide superior monitoring and management, subsequently leading to better firm performance. In this section, our aim is to empirically show this. We thus run our fixed effects regression on the sample of high- and low-reputation VC-backed firms separately, and estimate the joint covariance matrix for (3) estimated for high- and low-reputation VCbacked firms.45 In Panel A of Table 11, the first two columns correspond to high- and low-reputation VC-backed firm regressions, respectively; the third column presents the difference in TFPs between high- and low-reputation VCs at all stages; and the fourth column presents the difference in the net effect of monitoring (i.e., $T F P_{A f t e r}-T F P_{B e f o r e})$ between high- and low-reputation VCs.  \n\nConsistent with our earlier results, we find that both high- and lowreputation VCs actively engage in screening and select firms that on average have a higher TFP than non-VC-backed firms. Further, we find that lowreputation VCs screen firms with higher levels of initial TFP (averaged across five years prior to receiving financing) compared with high-reputation VCs. When we analyze the growth in firm TFP after receiving VC financing, we find that post-financing TFP growth is significantly greater for highreputation VCs, suggesting that high-reputation VCs are better at improving productivity levels through monitoring compared with low-reputation VCs. We show that the above net effect of monitoring is both statistically and economically significant, on average being $10\\%$ higher for firms receiving funding from high-reputation VCs compared with firms receiving funding from low-reputation VCs. Our analysis presents an interesting and hitherto undocumented result, suggesting that most of the productivity gains of firms backed by low-reputation VCs can be attributed to the screening technology employed by such VCs, while in contrast, most of the productivity gains of firms that are backed by high-reputation VCs come from the ability of such VCs to improve the post-financing TFP of firms they invest in—i.e., through their monitoring activities. This is not surprising since high-reputation VCs have greater experience and expertise in managing entrepreneurial firms and therefore are able to provide additional extra-financial services to these firms that ultimately result in better operating efficiency and performance. The higher net effect of $10\\%$ on firm TFP arising due to better monitoring by highreputation VCs translates to an increase in profits of approximately $35\\%$ ,as mentioned previously. These results are also somewhat related with earlier empirical work by Gompers and Lerner (1999), who find that profit shares are higher for older and larger VCs. Similarly, these results are also related to those in Kaplan and Schoar (2005), who analyze both VC and buyout fund returns and show that there is a large degree of heterogeneity among fund returns. They show that returns tend to improve with the experience of the general partner. The above results establish that financing from reputable VCs (who are potentially also more experienced) lead to higher operating efciency and TFP of their portfolio firms. Thus, when high-reputation VCs exit their investments it could potentially lead them to realize the higher returns that have been documented by the above articles.46  \n\nIn Panel B of Table 11, we analyze the round-by-round improvements in firm TFP for firms backed by high- and low-reputation VCs.

The regression results are reported separately for high- and low-reputation VC-backed firms. The independent variables in Panel A areVCBefore(-4,O),whichis a dummy variable that equals one for years $^{-4}$ to O prior to obtaining the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise;VCAfter(1,4), which is a dummy variable that equals one for years 1 to 4 after obtaining the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise; VCAfter( $\\geq5,$ which equals one in or after year 5 of VC financing and zero otherwise; Firm Size, which is the natural log of the firm's capital stock in a given year; Herfindahl Index, which is the concentration of the firm's three-digit SIC industry; and firm and year fixed effects. The independent variables in Panel B (not included in Panel A) are VCBefore, which is a dummy variable that equals one for all years prior to the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise; VCAfter(Rl),which is a dummy variable that equals one for years after the first round but before the second round of VC financing and zero otherwise;VCAfter(R2),which is a dummy variable that equals one for years after the second round but before the third round of VC financing and zero otherwise; VCAfter(R3), which is a dummy variable that equals one for years after the third round but before the fourth round of VC financing and zero otherwise; $V C A f t e r(\\geq R4)$ , which is a dummy variable that equals one for years after the fourth round of VC financing and zero otherwise.

All regressions are estimated with an intercept term. $^{****},^{**}$ , and \\* represent statisticalsignificanceat the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nthe results above, we first show that the TFP of firms backed by low-reputation VCs is significantly greater than the TFP of firms backed by high-reputation VCs prior to receiving VC financing, suggesting that low-reputation VCs screen firms with higher initial levels of TFP. However, the results also show that after each round of receiving VC financing, the TFP of firms backed by high-reputation VCs is significantly greater than the TFP of firms backed by low-reputation VCs, again suggesting that high-reputation VCs are better able to increase the post-financing effciency of firms due to their better monitoring abilities. The results on the round-by-round improvement in firm TFP for highand low-reputation VCs show that the TFP improvement after VC backing is much greater for firms backed by high-reputation VCs than for those backed by low-reputation VCs.  \n\nOverall, our results are consistent with higher-reputation VCs providing greater monitoring services to the firms that they back, since these firms experience greater improvements in their productivity subsequent to VC financing.47  \n\n### 6.2 Differences in channels of TFP improvements between high- and low-reputation VC-backed firms  \n\nIn this section, we investigate if there are differences in the underlying process of efficiency improvements between firms backed by high-reputation VCs and those backed by low-reputation VCs. We also present evidence on how greater efficiency (TFP) improvements are realized by high-reputation VCs. We do so by estimating the joint covariance matrix for (3) estimated for high- and low-reputation VC-backed firms as in Table 11. In Table 12, we investigate the dynamics of total sales and total production costs around the year of receiving the first round of VC financing for firms backed by high- and low-reputation VCs, benchmarked against that of non- VC-backed firms.  \n\nPanel A of Table 12 presents the results for total sales for high- and lowreputation VC-backed firms benchmarked against non-VC-backed firms. The results show that prior to receiving financing, total sales for both high- and low-reputation VC-backed firms are significantly greater than that of nonVC-backed firms. Moreover, at this time, total sales for firms backed by high-reputation VCs are greater than that of firms backed by low-reputation VCs, with the difference being on average around $2\\%$ . Subsequent to receiving VC financing, we also find that the growth in sales (from before to after receiving financing) is significantly greater for firms that are backed by highreputation VCs compared with those backed by low-reputation VCs with  \n\nPanel A:LogTotal Sales  \n\nTable12 Dynamics of inputs in TFP around the first round of VC financing for high- and low-reputation VCbackedfirms   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>High- reputation VC</td><td>Low- reputation VC</td><td>Diff.

The regression results are reported separately for high- and low-reputation VC-backed firms. The independent variables are VCBefore(-4,0), which is a dummy variable that equals one for years $^{-4}$ to O prior to obtaining the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise;VCAfter(1,4),which is a dummy variable that equals one for years 1 to 4 after obtaining the first round of VC financing and zero otherwise; $V C A f t e r(\\geq5)$ ,，which equals one in and after year 5 of VC financing and zero otherwise; Firm Size, which is the natural log of the firm's capital stock in a given year; and firm and year fixed effects. Heteroscedasticity corrected robust standard errors, which are clustered on firms, are in brackets. All regressions are estimated with an intercept term. \\*\\*\\*, \\*, and \\* represent statistical significance at the $1\\%$ ， $5\\%$ ,and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nthe difference in sales growth being on average around $2.5\\%$ .Thus,the larger improvement in TFP achieved by high-reputation VC-backed firms, documented in Table 11, could partially be explained by this better product market performance through increased sales growth of high-reputation VCbacked firms compared with low-reputation VC-backed firms.  \n\nPanel B of Table 12 presents the results for the total production costs of high- and low-reputation VC-backed firms. We find that total production cost  \n\nHow DoesVenture Capital FinancingImprove Efficiency in Private Firms?  \n\nis consistently lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms compared with lowreputation VC-backed firms both before and after receiving VC financing, even though it is significantly above that of non-VC-backed firms. Moreover, the increase in production cost from before receiving financing to after receiving financing is also lower for firms that are backed by high-reputation VCs, suggesting that active monitoring by high-reputation VCs may lead to lower increases in cost for these firms, thus leading to more efficient production and higher productivity gains for high-reputation VC-backed firms compared with low-reputation VC-backed firms. This lower increase in total production cost for high-reputation VC-backed firms is on average around $1.5\\%$ in the first four years after receiving financing and around $7.5\\%$ in years five and after, both of which are statistically and economically significant.48  \n\nThe results presented in this section clearly show us how high-reputation VC-backed firms are able to achieve higher increases in productivity and efficiency improvements compared with firms backed by low-reputation VCs. It also shows us how better monitoring abilities of high-reputation VCs may be reflected through the production technology. We establish that the higher improvements in TFP and efficiency achieved by high-reputation VC-backed firms come from both better product market performance by such firms, through higher sales realizations, as well as through various cost reductions associated with the production process. These results therefore attest to the better monitoring ability of high-reputation VCs, which are able to achieve better sales using lower input levels and thus are able to attain higher levels of productivity improvements for the firms they invest in.  \n\n## 7. Impact of VC Backing and Productivity on the Probability of Exit  \n\nIn this section, we analyze the effect of VC financing on the exit probability of firms and whether the increased productivity of VC-backed firms leads to a higher probability of a successful exit. We relate VC backing and the TFP of a firm to its probability of exit either through an IPO or through a merger/acquisition (M&A) as opposed to a write-off. We analyze the effect of VC backing and TFP growth on the probability of a successful exit using a multinomial logit model. We estimate the following multinomial logit model:  \n\nExit -Type = F(VC backing, TFP-Growth, Avg-prior-TFP, Firm-size, Controls),  \n\nTable13 Venture capital backing and IPO and acquisition frequency   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>IPO</td><td>M&A</td></tr><tr><td>VCBacking</td><td>1.119***</td><td>1.655***</td></tr><tr><td>TFPGrowth</td><td>[0.184] 0.360***</td><td>[0.153] 0.024</td></tr><tr><td>AveragePriorTFP</td><td>[0.120] 0.292**</td><td>[0.094] 0.037</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.130]</td><td>[0.097]</td></tr><tr><td>Firm Size</td><td>0.434*** [0.028]</td><td>0.305*** [0.027]</td></tr><tr><td>Firm Age</td><td>-0.031***</td><td>0.003</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.006]</td><td>[0.005]</td></tr><tr><td>HerfindahlIndex</td><td>0.231</td><td>0.525</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[0.510]</td><td>[0.540]</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>405798</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chi2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>216807.7</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the results of multinomial logit estimation with type of exit (i.e., No Exit, IPO, or M&A) as the dependent variable.No Exit is the base case outcome. The dependent variables are $V C$ backing, which is a dummy variable that is one for firms that obtain VC financing; TFP Growth,which is the TFP Growth calculated as current year TFP minus the prior five-year average TFP; Average Prior TFP,which is the five-year average TFP prior to the current year; Firm Size, which is the natural log of the firm's capital stock in the current year; Herfindahl Index, which is the measure of concentration of the firm’s three-digit SIC industry; Firm Age, which is the natural logarithm of the number of years since the firm first appeared in the LRD sample; and year and two-digit SIC industry dummies. Heteroscedasticity corrected robust standard errors, which are clustered on firms, are in brackets. The regression is estimated with an intercept term. $***$ $^{**}$ ,and \\*represent statistical significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ ,and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nwhere Exit_Type is a dummy variable representing three categories: write-offs (the base category), M&As, and IPOs; Avg-prior_TFP signifies the five-year average TFP prior to the current year; and TFP_Growth is the current year TFP minus the average prior five-year average TFP. In addition to firm size, we also control for firm age, Herfindahl index of the firm's industry, year dummies, and two-digit SIC industry dummies. Our results estimating (8) are presented in Table 13.  \n\nWe find that VC backing has a significant positive effect on the exit probability (for both IPO and M&A exits). Further, both TFP growth and prior average TFP have a positive relation with the exit probability through IPOs, but not with the exit probability through acquisitions. In addition, we also find that firm size is positively related to the probability of a successful exit through either an IPO or an M&A, while younger firms are more likely to exit through an IPO.  \n\nOverall, the results suggest that VC backing has a positive impact on IPO and M&A exits, and further, TFP growth has a positive and significant association with the probability of IPO exits.  \n\n## 8. Relation to the Existing Literature  \n\nOur article is related to the existing literature that compares VC-backed firms with non-VC-backed firms. Some important articles in this literature are Hellmann and Puri (2000, 2002) and Hsu (2006). Hellmann and Puri (2000)  \n\nHowDoesVentureCapital FinancingImproveEfficiency inPrivateFirms?  \n\nprovide evidence that VC financing is related to the product market strategies and outcomes of startups, while Hellmann and Puri (2002) provide evidence regarding the professionalization of startup firms. Hsu (2006) analyzes the impact of VC backing on the frequency of cooperative commercialization strategies of technology-based startups. He finds substantial boosts in cooperative activity associated with VC-backed firms. We extend the above literature by comparing the overall efficiency of VC-backed and non- VC-backed private firms, and by analyzing how and when efficiency improvements arise due to VCbacking.  \n\nOther studies in the literature have focused on the monitoring role of VCs based on samples of VC-backed firms; see, e.g., Lerner (1995), who examines VCs’ representation on the boards of private firms and analyzes whether this representation is greater when the need for oversight is greater. We extend this literature by distinguishing between the screening and monitoring roles of venture capitalists, directly comparing samples of VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms, as well as high-reputation VC-backed and lowreputation VC-backed firms.49 In addition, Bottazzi, Da Rin, and Hellmann (2008) find that VC activism is related to VC partner experience and VC firm characteristics (such as whether the VC firm is independent or related to another institution such as a company, bank, or government-owned agency). Finally, the effect of VC backing on IPOs has been documented by several articles. Megginson and Weiss (1991) study the certification role of venture backing in the financing of IPOs. More recently, using a sample of venturebacked firms, Sorensen (2007) shows that companies funded by more experienced VCs are more likely to go public. He documents that this follows both from the direct infuence of more experienced VCs and also from sorting in the market for venture capital. While our results are broadly consistent with the evidence presented in his article, we analyze the productivity of VC-backed firms, while Sorensen (2007) analysis uses only IPO exits as a measure of performance. Our article also contributes to the emerging literature on the role of financial intermediaries in the birth, growth, and death of entrepreneurial firms: see, e.g., Kerr and Nanda (2009).50  \n\nIn a contemporaneous related article, Puri and Zarutskie (2009) study the life-cycle dynamics of VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms and examine the importance of VCs in new firm creation. Their results show that VCs typically invest in firms that exhibit potential for large scale prior to exit. They also analyze the survival of VC-backed firms relative to that of non-VC-backed firms. In contrast, we focus on distinguishing between the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing, how such activities affect firm productivity, and the differences between high- and low-reputation VCs in accomplishing these activities. Further, we document several new results related to the channels through which VCs improve entrepreneurial firm productivity, and the relationship between such productivity improvements and the probability of successful exit.  \n\n## 9. Conclusion  \n\nWe use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which covers the entire universe of private and public U.S. manufacturing firms, to study several related questions regarding the efficiency gains generated by venture capital (VC) investment in private firms. Our analysis shows that the overall effciency of VC-backed firms is higher than that of non-VCbacked firms at every point in time. This efficiency advantage of VC-backed firms arises from both screening and monitoring: The efficiency of VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms, and further, the growth in efficiency subsequent to VC financing is greater for such firms. The above increases in efficiency of VC-backed firms are spread over the first two rounds of VC financing, after which the TFP of such firms remains constant until exit. We further show that while the TFP of firms prior to receiving financing is lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms than for low-reputation VC-backed firms, the increase in TFP subsequent to financing is significantly greater for these firms, consistent with high-reputation VCs having greater monitoring ability.  \n\nWe disentangle the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing using three different methodologies: switching regression with endogenous switching; regression discontinuity analysis; and propensity score matching. We show that while overall efficiency gains generated by VC backing arise primarily from improvements in sales, the efficiency gains of high-reputation VC-backed firms arise also from lower increases in production costs. Finally, we show that VC backing and the associated efficiency gains positively affect the probability of a successful exit.  \n\n### Appendix A: Switching Regression Model  \n\nA switching regression model with endogenous switching consists of a binary outcome equation that reflects the selection or matching between the VC and the firm, and two regression equations on the variable of interest, in this case TFP growth.Formally, we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{I_{i}^{*}=Z_{i}^{\\prime}\\gamma+\\varepsilon_{i},}\\ &{y_{1i}=x_{i}^{\\prime}\\beta_{1}+u_{1i},\\mathrm{~and}}\\ &{y_{2i}=x_{i}^{\\prime}\\beta_{2}+u_{2i}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEquation (9) is the latent VC-firm matching equation. To refect binary outcomes, $I^{*}$ isdiscretized asfollows:  \n\n$$\nI_{i}=1\\mathrm{iff}I_{i}^{\\ast}>0,\\mathrm{and}I_{i}=0\\mathrm{iff}I_{i}^{\\ast}\\leq0.\n$$  \n\nIn other words, $I_{i}$ equals one if and only if a firm receives VC financing. In this setup, the VC firm matching is modeled in reduced form. The dependent variable $I_{i}$ indicates the outcome of whether a firm receives VC financing, which results from decisions of both the firm and the VC and the screening technology adopted by the VC. Accordingly, in the empirical specification, the vector $Z_{i}$ contains variables that are related to the VC or the entrepreneurial firm. We estimate this first-stage equation using a dynamic probit model in which the dependent variable is a binary dummy, identifying whether a firm receives VC backing or not.51  \n\nEquation (10) analyzes the growth in TFP after receiving financing for VC-backed firms while controlling for selection effects, while Equation (11) does the same for firms that did not receive VC financing. To estimate the model, a key observation is that since either Equation (10) or (11) is realized depending on the outcome of $I^{*}$ (but never both), the observed TFP growth is a conditional variable. Taking expectations of Equation (10), we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{E[y_{1i}]=E[y_{i}|I_{i}=1]}\\ &{\\qquad=E[y_{i}|I_{i}^{*}>0]}\\ &{\\qquad=E[X_{i}^{'}\\beta_{1}+u_{1i}|Z_{i}^{'}\\gamma+\\varepsilon_{i}>0]}\\ &{\\qquad=X_{i}^{'}\\beta_{1}+E[u_{1i}|\\varepsilon_{i}>-Z_{i}^{'}\\gamma].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBecause $u_{1}$ and $\\varepsilon$ are correlated, the last conditional expectation term in (13) does not have a zero mean, and OLS on Equation (10) will generate inconsistent estimates. If, however, Equation (10) is augmented with the inverse Mills ratio from the first-stage probit estimation as a right-hand-side variable, we can use OLS to find consistent estimates. This procedure is discussed in detail in Heckman (1979) and Maddala (1983). Equation (9) is first estimated by a probit regression, yielding consistent estimates of y. With this, the inverse Mills ratio terms can be computed for Equations (10) and (11). Both equations are then augmented with the inverse Mills ratios as aditional regressors.52 These terms adjust for the conditional mean of $u$ , and allow the equations to be consistently estimated by OLS.  \n\nOne can compute the hypothetical TFP growth for VC-backed firms had they not received VC financing using Equation (11) and the hypothetical TFP growth for non-VC-backed firms had they received VC financing using Equation (10). Thus, to infer the monitoring effects of VCs on firm TFP growth, we compute the following difference:  \n\n$$\n\\underbrace{y_{1i}}_{\\mathrm{actual}}-\\underbrace{E[y_{2i}|I_{i}^{*}>0]}_{\\mathrm{hypothetical}}.\n$$  \n\nThe first term in (14) is the actual TFP growth of a VC-backed firm, while the second is the hypothetical TFP growth that would be obtained by the same firm had it not received VC financing. If the difference is positive, then the impact on TFP growth due to the monitoring services provided by the VC is explicitly quantified, since the actual TFP growth achieved by VC-backed firms is higher.  \n\nReferences   \nAngrist, J.

Chemmanur Carroll School of Management, Boston College  \n\nElena Loutskina Darden School of Business, University of Virginia  \n\nXuan Tian   \nKelley School of Business, Indiana University and PBC School of Finance,   \nTsinghua University  \n\nWe analyze how corporate venture capital (CVC) differs from independent venture capital (IVC) in nurturing innovation in entrepreneurial firms. We find that CVC-backed firms are more innovative, as measured by their patenting outcome, although they are younger, riskier, and less profitable than IVC-backed firms. Our baseline results continue to hold in a propensity score matching analysis of IPO firms and a difference-in-differences analysis of the universe of VC-backed entrepreneurial firms. We present evidence consistent with two possible underlying mechanisms: CVC's greater industry knowledge due to the technological fit between their parent firms and entrepreneurial firms and CVC's greater tolerance for failure.(JEL G24, G23,O31)  \n\nThe role of innovation as a critical driver of a nation's long-term economic growth and competitive advantage has been well established in the literature since Schumpeter. However, the optimal organizational form for nurturing innovation by U.S. corporations is still an open question that has been the subject of an important policy debate in recent years. For example, as Lerner (2012) points out, whereas researchers in corporate research laboratories account for two thirds of all U.S. research, it is not obvious that the current corporate setting is the best organizational form to nurture innovation, perhaps because large firms provide researchers with too little contingent compensation. On the other hand, he suggests that, while independent venture capital (IVC) firms have done great things for innovation, they have done so only in a few targeted industries, are subject to booms and busts (where funds from limited partners are either in oversupply or very scarce), and are vulnerable to mercurial public markets.1 Lerner (2012) therefore suggests that perhaps the best way to motivate innovation is a “hybrid\" model, such as a corporate venture capital (CVC) program, that combines features of corporate research laboratories and venturebacked start-ups “within a powerful system that consistently and efficiently produces new ideas.\"  \n\nU.S. corporations started establishing CVC funds as early as the 1960s. Over the years, CvC investments accounted for on average $7\\%$ of theventure capital industry. More recently, the share of CVC investments has increased significantly, reaching $15\\%$ by the end of 2011, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Corporations view establishing CVC subsidiaries as an effective way to conduct research and development (R&D) activities externally and to expose their management to new technologies and an entrepreneurial way of thinking (Chesbrough 2002; MacMillan et al. 2008). Not surprisingly, corporations with CVC subsidiaries enjoy a significant increase in their own innovation productivity and higher firm values (Dushnitsky and Lenox 2005, 2006). To the best of our knowledge, however, the effect of CVC financing on the innovation productivity of entrepreneurial firms backed by them has not been explored. The objective of this paper is to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the relative efficiency of CVCs and IVCs in nurturing innovation by the entrepreneurial firms backed by them.  \n\nThe relative ability of CVCs and IVCs in nurturing innovation is ultimately an empirical question. CVCs may be superior to IVCs in nurturing innovation, because the unique organizational and compensation structure of CVC may allow them to be more supportive of risky innovative activity. First, CVC funds are structured as subsidiaries of corporations, unlike IVC funds, which are structured as limited partnerships and are restricted by a contractually enforced ten-year lifespan. This means that CVCs have longer investment horizons than do IVCs. Second, as corporate subsidiaries, CVCs pursue both the strategic objectives of their parent companies and financial objectives, whereas IVCs’ sole investment goal is to achieve high financial returns. Third, the performance-based compensation structure (i.e., $2\\%$ of management fees and $20\\%$ of carried interest) enjoyed by IVC fund managers is normally not found in CVC funds: CVC fund managers are compensated by a fixed salary and corporate bonuses that are tied to their parent company's financial performance. The above three differences between CVCs and IVCs, namely, longer investment horizons, not being purely focused on financial returns, and the lack of purely performance-driven compensation schemes, may allow CVCs to be more open to experimentation and to occasional failures in their portfolio firms (necessary for motivating successful innovation) compared with IVCs. Further, the presence of a corporate parent may provide CVCs with a unique knowledge of the industry and the technology used by their portfolio firms, which is absent in IVCs. This superior industry and technology expertise of CVCs may enhance their ability to better use the soft information they receive about their portfolio firms’ research and development (R&D) activities, thus allowing them to better assess and nurture these new ventures’ technologies and products. Taken together, the above factors may allow CVCs to be more effective than IVCs in nurturing innovation in their portfolio firms.  \n\nHowever, the unique organizational structure of CvCs may also adversely affect their ability to foster innovation in their portfolio firms compared with IVCs. CVCs are structured as subsidiaries of corporations and have to procure the amount they invest in their portfolio firms from their corporate parents. This means that CVCs are subject to centralized resource allocation and associated corporate socialism (Rajan, Zingales, and Servaes 2000; Scharfstein and Stein 2000), which may foster mediocrity in R&D activities (Williamson 1985; Seru 2014). In addition, as corporate subsidiaries, CVCs pursue the strategic objectives of parent companies and their fund managers’ compensation is tied to parent firm financial performance. Therefore, CVCs may be incentivized to use corporate parents’ deep industry and technology expertise to exploit, rather than nurture, the entrepreneurial firms they invest in and hence impede innovation in these firms.2 In contrast, IVCs may be more efficient in their resource allocation because they are structured as limited partnerships and have full control over the capital committed by their limited partners. In addition, IVCs pursue purely financial returns and their fund managers are compensated based on financial performance. Further, IVCs are known to significantly contribute to entrepreneurial firms’ development: for example, they professionalize their management teams (Hellmann and Puri 2002) and foster collaborative relationships through strategic alliances among their portfolio firms (Lindsey 2008). Finally, IVCs also tend to specialize to a great extent (Gompers, Kovner, and Lerner 2009) and may thus possess the knowledge necessary to understand the industry-specific innovation process. Overall, their more efficient resource allocation, higher powered compensation schemes, and specialized industry expertise may make IVCs superior to CVCs in nurturing innovation.  \n\nTo address our research question, we first examine the innovation output of initial public offering (IPO) firms backed by CVCs versus those backed by IVCs. As has now become standard in the innovation literature (e.g., Aghion et al. 2005; Kogan et al. 2012; and Seru 2014), we use the National Bureau of Economics Research (NBER) Patent Citation database to construct two measures of innovation output: the number of patents generated by a firm as our measure of the “quantity” of innovation, and the number of future citations received per patent as our measure of the impact or “quality” of innovation. We find that CVC-backed firms produce more patents and patents that are of higher quality. Specifically, as compared with IVC-backed firms, CVC-backed IPO firms produce $26.9\\%$ more patents in the three years before IPO and these patents receive $17.6\\%$ more citations. In the first four years after IPO, including the IPO year, CVC-backed firms produce $44.9\\%$ more patents that receive $13.2\\%$ more future citations. Our baseline results are robust to alternative innovation measures (such as patent generality and patent originality) and a subsample analysis of IPO firms with nonzero patents.  \n\nThe above baseline results are consistent with two possible interpretations: the superior ability of CVCs to nurture innovation (a treatment effect), as well as the superior ability of CVCs to identify and select entrepreneurial firms with higher innovation potential (a selection effect). To disentangle these two effects, an ideal experiment would be to evaluate the innovation output of entrepreneurial firms under the random assignment of IVC and CVC investors. Because such an experiment is infeasible to implement, we use the propensity score matching procedure, which allows us to minimize the difference in observable characteristics between these two types of firms and thereby disentangle the treatment effect from a selection effect to some extent. We match the two types of firms at the IPO year using a wide set of dimensions known to affect innovation output. Our propensity score matching analysis results show that CVC-backed firms are characterized by an average of $25\\%$ higher innovation output pre-IPO and an average of $45\\%$ higher innovation output post-IPO. Although we cannot completely rule out the selection effect, these differences are more likely to be attributable to a treatment effect; that is, CVCs have a superior ability to nurture innovation in their entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nAlthough the IPO sample allows us to effectively control for a wide set of firm characteristics that affect innovation, it is potentially subject to survivorship bias and a sample selection problem because CVCs, compared with IVCs, may take only the most innovative firms public.3 To address this concern, we examine a sample consisting of the universe of VC-backed entrepreneurial firms. We hand-match the universe of VC-backed firms from the VentureXpert database to the patent information available from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) based on entrepreneurial firm name and location. Using this sample, we conduct the difference-in-differences (DiD)analysis toexamine theeffects of the first round of IVC and CVC investments on entrepreneurial firms’ subsequent innovation output. We find that entrepreneurial firms enjoy a significantly larger long-term increase in innovation output if they obtain their first financing round from CVCs rather than from IVCs. Specifically, although these two groups of firms exhibit a similar level of innovation output at the first investment round date, CvCbacked firms exhibit momentum in their innovation output and outperform IVC-backed firms over five years after the first investment round. We further show that this result is not driven by IPO successes alone, because we find similar evidence when we split the sample based on their exit outcomes and the current status: firms that eventually go public (the firms in our baseline sample), firms that are acquired by another company, firms that are written off, and firms that are still under active VC investment.  \n\nAnother potential concern is that our results are due to CVCs investing in more mature firms that are likely to be more innovative to begin with. To address this concern, we delve deeper into the characteristics of CVCversus IVC-backed firms and show that CVC-backed entrepreneurial firms are in fact younger and riskier at the VC investment round date. They spend significantly more on R&D than do IVC-backed firms, which is consistent with the greater innovation output of CVC-backed firms. CVC-backed firms are less profitable in the years immediately after IPO as compared with IVC-backed firms, although they start catching up in profitability in later years. CVC-backed firms not only receive their first VC financing but also go public at a younger age than do IVC-backed firms.  \n\nFinally, we explore two possible underlying economic mechanisms through which CVCs may better nurture innovation than do IVCs. First, we find that entrepreneurial firms that operate close to the industrial expertise of the CVC's parent company (i.e., have a better “technological fit’ with the parent firm) are more innovative. This finding is consistent with the superior technological expertise of CVCs allowing them to better evaluate the quality of the entrepreneurial firm's R&D projects and to better advise these entrepreneurial firms. Because an entrepreneurial firm is more likely to establish a strategic alliance with aCVC parent with which it has a technological fit, this is also consistent with Robinson (2008), who argues that strategic alliances help overcome incentive problems and are therefore more conducive to supporting risky innovation. Second, we evaluate the argument made by the existing theoretical literature that greater tolerance for failure by principals may motivate greater innovative activity by their agents. In their theoretical analysis, Hirshleifer and Thakor (1992) show that, because of managers’ concern for personal reputation development, punishing managers for early failure results in firms avoiding socially desirable, but risky, projects. In a somewhat similar vein, Manso (2011) argues that, because innovation is a complex activity, the optimal way to motivate innovation is to show tolerance for failure in the short run and provide rewards for success in the long run. In this context, failure tolerance may be defined as the extent to which VCs allow entrepreneurial firms additional time to overcome temporary setbacks or failures in the innovation process. Therefore, following Tian and Wang (2014), we measure tolerance for failure as the amount of time that venture capitalists allow entrepreneurial firms to bring their project to fruition before stopping their investment in these firms. We find that CVCs are more failure tolerant than are IVCs, and the failure tolerance of VC investors positively affects the innovation output of portfolio frms. The evidence suggests that greater tolerance for failure is another important mechanism that allows CVCs to better nurture innovation compared with IVCs.  \n\nOne limitation of our study is that we cannot conclusively distinguish between situations in which CVCs have a superior ability to select ventures that are ripe for an improvement in innovation output and in which they cause higher innovation output in their portfolio firms. However, the findings from our propensity score matching analysis and our DiD analysis suggest that the difference in innovation output between CVC- and IVC-backed firms is more likely due to a treatment effect, although we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that our results are driven, at least partially, by a selection effect as Well.  \n\nOur paper contributes to the ongoing debate about the optimal organizational form for nurturing innovation in entrepreneurial firms. One question that arises from our finding that CVCs are better than IVCs in nurturing innovation is why the two organizational forms coexist and why the majority of entrepreneurial firms continue to be funded by IVCs alone. One possible answer to the above question is that CVCs may be able to better nurture innovation only in firms within certain innovative industries in which the advantages of CVCs relative to IVCs, namely, better technological fit between the CVC corporate parent and the entrepreneurial firm and the greater failure tolerance of CVCs, dominate. On the other hand, for entrepreneurial firms in other industries, the disadvantage of CVCs relative to IVCs, namely, the centralized resource allocation associated with CVCs obtaining funding from their corporate parents and the potential conflicts of interest between a CVC's corporate parent and the entrepreneurial firm, may dominate, making IVCs the preferred source of financing.4  \n\nOur empirical findings shed light on the theoretical literature on corporate innovation and the role of financial intermediaries in fostering innovation. The evidence that CVC-backed firms are more innovative than are IVC-backed firms provides some support for the theories of Aghion and Tirole (1994) and Fulghieri and Sevilir (2009). These studies identify asymmetric information and moral hazard as key impediments to internal corporate innovation and categorize circumstances when entrepreneurial firms funded by CvCs are more innovative than are those funded by IVCs. To the extent that we document that CVCs are more failure tolerant than are IVCs, and that the failure tolerance of a CVC is positively related to the innovation undertaken by firms backed by it, our paper also provides further support for the failure tolerance hypothesis of Manso (2011). Finally, Hellmann (2002) argues that CVCs may invest in entrepreneurial firms mainly to benefit the CVC parent. In contrast, our findings indicate that CVC backing actually benefits the innovation productivity of entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nOur paper also extends the existing empirical literature on corporate venture capital. Existing studies find that CVC-backed firms tend to be either competitors of the CVC's parent firms or have technologies complementary to them (Masulis and Nahata 2009). Further, CVC portfolio firms are more likely to go public (Gompers and Lerner 2000; Gompers 2002), obtain higher valuation at the IPO date (Ivanov and Xie 2010), attract more reputable financial market players during the IPO process, and have better post-IPO long-run stock returns (Chemmanur, Loutskina, and Tian 2012).5 While this literature is consistent with the notion that the financial markets view CVC-backed firms as superior to IVC-backed firms in some dimension affecting future cash fows, ours is the first paper that points to a source of this superiority by explicitly showing that CVC financing increases the innovation productivity of entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nFinally, our paper contributes to the emerging body of literature exploring the drivers of technological innovation within firms. Spiegel and Tookes (2008) and Ferreira, Manso, and Silva (2014) link the private versus public status of firms to the nature and extent of innovations generated by these firms. Seru (2014) shows that the conglomerate organizational form adversely affects innovation productivity and attributes this finding to incentive problems faced by inventors who become less productive when confronted with centralized resource allocation. Hirshleifer, Low, and Teoh (2012) find that overconfident CEOs invest more in R&D, obtain more patents and patent citations, and achieve higher innovative efficiency. Other studies evaluate how the institutional and market settings affect firms′ innovation (e.g., Acharya and Subramanian 2009; Aghion, Van Reenen, and Zingales 2013; Chemmanur and Tian 2013; He and Tian 2013; Cornaggia et al. Forthcoming; Fang, Tian, and Tice Forthcoming). Finally, the empirical literature showing that VCs collectively contribute to technological innovation (e.g., Kortum and Lerner 2000; Tian and Wang 2014) is also related to our paper.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 compares the institutional features of CVCs and IVCs and their implications for nurturing innovation. Section 2 reports our sample selection procedures and summary statistics. Section 3 presents our empirical results. Section 4 examines two mechanisms that allow CVCs to nurture innovation to a greater extent. Section 5 concludes the paper.  \n\n## 1. Institutional Comparison of CVCs and IVCs  \n\nCVC and IVC funds share the same investment domain and a number of institutional features but are characterized by different organizational and corporate structures. First of all, CVCs are typically stand-alone subsidiaries of nonfinancial corporations and they invest in new ventures on behalf of their corporate parents. CVCs enjoy an almost unlimited (at least initially unrestricted) life span. In contrast, IVCs are usually structured as limited partnerships that are subject to a contractually enforced ten-year life (with the option of an extension of at most two years). In addition, CVCs are solely funded by their corporate parents and are not contractually limited in their ability to draw capital from a parent company as needed. However, IVCs' fund-draws are limited by the amount of capital initially committed by their limited partners. The longer investment horizons and relatively unconstrained capital supply of CVCs allow them to be more open to experimentation and exploration and to invest in long-term innovative ventures that may not generate immediate financial returns but have a high upside potential.  \n\nSecond, CVC and IVC funds use different managerial compensation practices and incentive alignment schemes (Dushnitsky and Shapira 2010). According to a 2000 survey conducted by Frederic W. Cook & Co., a vast majority of CvC funds ( $68\\%$ of the respondents) do not enjoy high-powered performance-based compensation schemes (carried interest incentives) that are standard for IVC funds. Instead, CVC fund managers are typically compensated through a fixed salary and annual bonuses that are tied to the parent company's performance, which is traditional in the corporate world. The survey also indicates that almost none of the CVC funds follow the traditional VC model of requiring employees to coinvest; they also do not permit voluntary coinvestment by CVC fund management members. Overall, such practices alter CVC fund managers’ incentives and are a double-edged sword in terms of nurturing innovation in the entrepreneurial firms in which they invest. On the one hand, the lack of high-powered compensation schemes allow CVC fund managers to be more failure tolerant (Manso 2011) and therefore to better nurture innovation. On the other hand, the fact that CVC fund managers' compensation is tied to their parent company's performance may increase their incentives to advance the interests of their corporate parents at the expense of the entrepreneurial firms they back, which, in turn, may impede innovation in these firms. In other words, this incentive to help their corporate parent may motivate CVCs to pursue exploitive, rather than nurturing, strategies toward entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nThird, unlike IVCs whose sole objective is to pursue financial returns, CVCs generally have a strategic mission to enhance the competitive advantage of their parents by bringing new ideas or technologies to these parent companies (MacMillan et al. 2008). Therefore, CVCs pursue both strategic and financial goals. Consequently, it is common for CvCs to seek commonalities between their corporate parents and the new ventures they back. A closely linked entrepreneurial firm could take advantage of the CVC parent company's manufacturing plants, distribution channels, technology, or brand and adopt the CVC parent company's business practices to build, sell, or service its own products. The corporate parent, in return, receives a window into new technologies and markets from the entrepreneurial firm and as a result could improve its existing business (MacMillan et al. 2008). Therefore, the presence of a corporate parent provides CVCs with a unique knowledge of the industry and the technology used by the entrepreneurial firms in which they invest. Such a technological fit between entrepreneurial firms and CVCs’ corporate parent companies allow CVCs to have superior industry and technology expertise and to have a better understanding of the entrepreneurial firms′ technologies, which may help nurture innovation in these portfolio firms.6 The CVC organizational form may also allow the transfer of soft information related to innovative projects between the CVC corporate parent and the entrepreneurial firm, a fact that may be harder to accomplish in the setting of an IVC firm.7  \n\nIn summary, on the one hand, the unique features of CVCs, namely, the longer investment horizons, less performance-driven compensation schemes, and industry and technology support from their parent firms, allow CVCs to provide better technological support and to be more failure tolerant toward the entrepreneurial firms they fund, enabling them to nurture innovation in these firms to a greater extent than do IVCs. On the other hand, CVCs' need to procure resources from their corporate parents and their focus on enhancing their parent firm's performance may hamper their incentives and reduce their efficiency in nurturing innovation in these entrepreneurial firms.  \n\n## 2. Data and Sample Selection  \n\n### 2.1 Identifying CVCs  \n\nTo identify CVC investors, we start with the list of 1,846 VCs that enjoy investments from corporations as reported by the Thomson VentureXpert database. Using various sources of information (Factiva, Google, Lexus/Nexus, etc.), we manually identify VCs with a unique corporate parent. We find that out of 1,846 potential CVC firms: (1) 456 firms cannot be considered as a CVC because they are funded by financial companies, partnerships, or multiple corporate parents and (2) 466 are CVC/IVC firms that have a foreign or unknown parent. This leaves us with 926 distinct CVC firms, out of which 562 are affiliated with publicly traded parent firms. We define an entrepreneurial firm as a CVC-backed firm if it receives financing from at least one CVC investor.  \n\nFor each CVC firm in our sample, we find the characteristics of the corporate parent, such as industry and size. Specifically, we match the sample of CVCs to the Compustat database to identify publicly traded corporate parents and to the Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) database to identify privately held corporate parents. This matching allows us to identify the primary SIC code for the CVC corporate parent. We then use these SIC codes in our analysis of whether the technological fit between corporate parents and entrepreneurial firms contributes to CVCs' abilities to nurture innovation.  \n\n### 2.2 Baseline sample  \n\nWe obtain the list of IPO firms that went public between 1980 and 2004. We focus our main analyses based on a sample of IPO firms because of the lack of private firms’ financial data availability: we do not observe private firms’ accounting and ownership information and therefore cannot control for important drivers of innovation for private firms. We obtain the list of IPOs from the Securities Data Company (SDC) Global New Issues Database.& In line with other IPOs studies, we eliminate equity offerings of financial institutions (SIC codes between 6000 and 6999) and regulated utilities and issues with an offer pricebelow $\\$5$ . The IPO should issue ordinary common shares and should not be a unit offering, closed-end fund, real estate investment trust, or an American depositary receipt. Moreover, the issuing firm must be present on the Compustat annual industrial database for the fiscal year prior to the offering.  \n\nWe merge this IPO list with VentureXpert to consistently identify VC-backed IPO firms. We find that 287 IPO firms have venture investments as reported by VentureXpert but are classified as non-VC-backed in SDC. We consider these firms to be VC-backed. Similarly, 365 firms are classified as VC-backed in SDC but are not recorded in VentureXpert. We exclude these IPO firms from consideration if the information on the identity of the investing VCs is unavailable through SDC and VentureXpert. We also exclude IPO firms with investments from VCs that we are unable to classify or those in which the data on venture investment are inconsistent across two databases. We end with 2,129 VC-backed IPO firms, of which 462 are CVC-backed.  \n\n### 2.3 Measuring innovation  \n\nFollowing the existing literature (e.g., Kogan et al. 2012; Seru 2014), we use patent-based metrics to capture firm innovativeness. Whereas earlier studies use R&D expenditures as a proxy for the innovation activity, we use the patent-based measures, which are better proxies because they capture the actual innovation output and capture how effectively a firm has used its innovation inputs (both observable and unobservable). We obtain information on entrepreneurial firm's patenting from the NBER Patent Citation database (see Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg 2001 for details). The database provides detailed information on more than three million patents granted by the USPTO from 1976 to 2006, including patent assignee names, the number of citations received by each patent, and a patent's application as well as grant year. The span of the innovation data limits our ability to expand our IPO sample beyond 2004. We use the NBER bridge file to Compustat to match patents to IPO firms. This link allows us to consistently evaluate the innovation activity for IPO firms starting well before they go public.  \n\nThe NBER patent database is subject to two types of truncation problems. We follow the innovation literature to correct for the truncation problems. First, patents are recorded in the database only after they are granted and the lag between patent applications and patent grants is significant (about two years on average). As we approach the last few years for which there are patent data available (e.g., 2005 and 2006 in the database used in this paper), we observe a smaller number of patent applications that are eventually granted. This is because many patent applications filed during these years were still under review and had not been granted until 2006. Following Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2001, 2005), we correct for the truncation bias in patent counts using the “weight factors\"” computed from the application-grant empirical distribution. The second type of truncation problem is stemming from citation counts. Patents tend to receive citations over a long period of time, so the citation counts of more recent patents are significantly downward biased. Following Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2001, 2005), the citation truncation is corrected by estimating the shape of the citation-lag distribution.  \n\nThe NBER patent database is unlikely to be subject to survivorship bias. An eventually granted patent application is counted and attributed to the applying firm at the time when the patent application is submitted, even if the firm is later acquired or goes bankrupt. In addition, patent citations attribute to a patent, but not a firm. Hence, a patent assigned to an acquired or bankrupt firm can continue to receive citations for many years even after it goes out of existence.  \n\nWe construct two measures for a firm's annual innovation output.9 The first measure, Ln(Patents), is the natural logarithm of annual truncation-adjusted patent count for a firm. Specifically, this variable counts the number of patent applications filed in that year that is eventually granted. However, a simple count of patents may not distinguish breakthrough innovations from incremental technological discoveries.10 Therefore, we construct the second measure, Ln(Citations/Patent), that intends to capture the importance of patents by counting the number of citations received by each patent in the subsequent years. To better capture the impact of patents, we exclude self-citations when we compute citations per patent, but our results are robust to including selfcitations. To avoid losing firm-year observations with zero patents or zero citations per patent, we add one to the actual values when taking natural logarithm.  \n\nIt is important to note that using patenting activity to measure corporate innovation is not without limitations. For example, different industries have various innovation propensity and duration. Young firms in some industries might abstain from patenting for competitive reasons. Therefore, fewer patents generated in an industry might not necessarily be reflective of a less innovative industry. However, we believe that an adequate control for heterogeneity across industries and firms should alleviate this concern and lead to reasonable inferences that can be applicable across industries and firms.  \n\nTable 1 Panel A reports the summary statistics for innovation output of IPO firms based on IPO firm-year observations. The sample covers three years prior to and four years after the portfolio firm IPO date. The distribution of patents is right skewed. On average, an entrepreneurial firm has 2.5 patents per year. If we break down the sample into CVC- and IVC-backed firms, we find that CVC-backed entrepreneurial firms have a larger number of patents; that is, an average CVC-backed firm has four patents per year, whereas an average IVCbacked firm has 1.6 patents. The impact of patents measured by the number of citations per patent exhibits similar trends. On average, a firm's patent receives 2.3 citations, and CVC-backed firms generate patents with a larger impact (3.2 citations per patent) than do those filed by IVC-backed firms (1.8 citations per patent).  \n\n### 2.4 Control variables  \n\nFollowing the innovation literature, we obtain IPO firm financial information from Compustat and construct a number of firm characteristics that affect firms? innovation output. These control variables include firm size $(L n(T o t a l A s s e t s))$ profitability (ROA), R&D expenditures (R&D in Total Assets), asset tangibility (PPE in Total Assets), leverage level (Leverage), capital investment (CE in Total Assets), product market competition captured by the Herfindahl index based on sales (Herfindahl), growth opportunities (Tobin's q), financial constraints (KZ Index), and firm age at the IPO year (Ln(Age at IPO). To mitigate nonlinear effects of product market competition on innovation (Aghion et al. 2005), we also include the squared Herfindal index (Herfindahl Squared) in our baseline regressions.  \n\nTable 1 Summary statistics Panel A: IPO firm's innovation productivity (observation unit: IPO firm-year)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SD</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>Patents:Full sample</td><td>2.48</td><td></td><td>14.45</td><td>9,425</td></tr><tr><td>Patents:CVC-backed firms</td><td>4.02</td><td>18.49</td><td></td><td>3,314</td></tr><tr><td>Patents:IVC-backedfirms</td><td>1.64</td><td>11.61</td><td></td><td>6,111</td></tr><tr><td>Citations/patent:Full sample</td><td>2.28</td><td>9.30</td><td></td><td>9,425</td></tr><tr><td>Citations/patent:CVC-backedfirms</td><td>3.20</td><td>10.97</td><td></td><td>3,314</td></tr><tr><td>Citations/patent:IVC-backedfirms</td><td>1.78</td><td></td><td>8.21</td><td>6,111</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Panel B:Controlvariables(observationunit:IPOfirm)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SD</td><td>P25</td><td>Median</td><td>P75</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>Assets (million)</td><td>110.06</td><td>240.75</td><td>16.25</td><td>101.93</td><td>1,859</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.27</td><td>0.16</td><td>54.03 0.07</td><td>1,859</td></tr><tr><td>R&Din totalassets</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.07</td><td>1,859</td></tr><tr><td>PPEintotalassets</td><td>0.23</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.08</td><td></td><td>1,859</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.18</td><td>0.01</td><td></td><td>1,859</td></tr><tr><td>CE in total assets</td><td>0.08</td><td>0.09</td><td>0.02</td><td></td><td>1,859</td></tr><tr><td>HHI of industry sales</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.33</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.37</td><td>1,859</td></tr><tr><td>Tobin's q</td><td>4.28</td><td>6.51</td><td>1.85</td><td>4.30</td><td>1,859</td></tr><tr><td>KZ index</td><td>20.95</td><td>49.70</td><td>18.83</td><td>0.62</td><td>1,859</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table reports the descriptive statistics for the sample of individual investments by CVCs and IVCs from 1980 to 2004. Panel A presents the summary statistics for firms'innovation output. The observation unit in Panel Ais IPO firm-year. Panel B presents the summary statistics for other control variables. The unit of observation in Panel B is IPO firm. The main data sources are the Thomson VentureXpert database, the NBER Patent Citation database,andCompustat.  \n\nTable 1 Panel B provides summary statistics of the control variables: the observational unit is an IPO firm. On average, an IPO firm in our sample has bookvalue of assetsof $\\$110$ million, ROA of $-1\\%$ , R&D-to-asset ratio of $10\\%$ , PPE-to-assets ratio of $23\\%$ , leverage ratio of $10\\%$ , capital expenditure of $8\\%$ , Herfindahl index of 0.25, and Tobin's q of 4.3. These VC-backed IPO characteristics are similar to those reported in other IPO studies.  \n\nIn Table 2 we compare the maturity (Panel A) and the operating performance (Panel B) of CVC- and IVC-backed IPO firms. We capture firm maturity by firm age at both the first VC investment year and the IPO year. We measure firm age at the first VC investment year as the number of years between the firm founding year and the first VC investment year. Similarly, a firm's age at the IPO year is the number of years from a firm's founding year to its IPO year. To compare post-IPO operating performance, we match CVC- and IVC-backed firms based on IPO year, 49 Fama-French industry classifications (available at Kenneth French's website http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html), and firm total assets at IPO year to minimize potential biases. We ensure a unique match of IVC-backed IPO firm for each CVC-backed IPO firm.  \n\nPanel A: Firm age  \n\nTable2 Firm age and operating performance of CVC- and IVC-backed firms   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Year</td><td>CVC</td><td>IVC</td><td>Difference</td></tr><tr><td>In first VC funding year (mean)</td><td>2.05</td><td>5.11</td><td>-3.46***</td></tr><tr><td>In first VC funding year (median)</td><td>1.00</td><td>2.00</td><td>-1.00***</td></tr><tr><td>In IPO year (mean)</td><td>6.53</td><td>10.31</td><td>-3.77***</td></tr><tr><td>In IPO year (median)</td><td>5.00</td><td>7.00</td><td>-2.00***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Panel B: Operating performance</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>CVC</td><td>IVC</td><td>Difference</td></tr><tr><td>1.

Panel Areports firm age, both at the first VC investment year and at the IPO year. Panel B presents the operating performance measures at the IPO year and up to five years after IPO. $R O A$ is net income divided by total assets; Profit Margin is the ratio of net income to sales; and R&D in Total Assets is a ratio of R&D expenditures to total assets. \\*\\*\\*, $^{**}$ ,and $^*$ indicate significance at the $1\\%$ ， $5\\%$ ,and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nPanel A shows that CVC-backed firms are significantly younger than are IVC-backed firms, both in the first VC investment year and in the IPO year. The mean age differences between these two groups of firms are 3.5 years and 3.8 years at the first VC investment year and the IPO year, respectively. Panel B shows that CVC-backed firms exhibit significantly poorer operating performance post-IPO (years zero to year five) than do IVC-backed firms, even after controlling for firm IPO year, industry, and firm size. CVC-backed IPOs underperformIVC-backedIPOsby $14.4\\%$ interms ofROA and $147.2\\%$ interms of profit margin in the IPO year. However, CVC-backed IPOs’ profitability improves significantly over four years post-IPO and their profit margin is statistically insignificant from that of IVC-backed firms in year five. The evidence suggests that CVC-backed firms quickly catch up with IVC-backed firms in terms of operating performance. Panel B also shows that CVC-backed firms persistently exhibit higher R&D in post-IPO years than do IVC-backed firms.  \n\nThe poorer operating performance of CVC-backed firms immediately after IPO may reflect the fact that they are younger at the time of IPO compared with IVC-backed firms. An alternative explanation for this finding is that it generally takes a long time for firms to commercialize their innovation output and enjoy the return from undertaking innovation. Therefore, CVC-backed firms' higher innovativeness (as we show in the next section) may not be completely reflected in their current cash fows, and hence they underperform when we use cashflow-based performance metrics to gauge their operating performance.  \n\n### 2.5 Round financing  \n\nTo understand the characteristics of entrepreneurial firms financed by CVCs and IVCs, we obtain VC round-by-round investments from VentureXpert. We retrieve information about all entrepreneurial firms that obtain venture capital financing between 1980 and 2004. We exclude financial firms, firms with unclassified venture capital investments (e.g., those with foreign VC investors) and those with missing or inconsistent data, and we obtain 24,549 distinct entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nVentureXpert provides detailed information on individual financing rounds, including the entrepreneurial firm's development stage at the first VC investment round, the date the firm was established, the date and investment amount of each financing round, and the identity of the investing venture capital investors. We update and fill in the missing observations for the date when the firm was established. We use Jay Ritter's database (available at http://bear.cba.uf.edu/ritter/ipodata.htm) for the subset of firms that go public and D&B and CorpTech Explore Databases for firms remaining private. We further update and cross-reference this information with other databases. For example, we fll in the missing values for SIC codes using Compustat for already public firms and D&B and CorpTech Explore Databases for private firms.  \n\nFinally, to be able to effectively control for the quality of IVCs coinvesting with CVCs, we obtain the list of IVCs from VentureXpert. We aggregate this data to the IVC firm level and construct three reputation measures for each IVC and the financing round date: (1) age of an IVC firm, (2) number of rounds an IVC firm participated in since 1965, and (3) total dollar amount invested since1965.  \n\n## 3. Empirical Results  \n\nThe objective of our study is to compare the innovation output of CVC- and IVC-backed firms. In our baseline analysis, we examine the innovation output of firms going public pre- and post-IPO and report the results in Section 3.1. In Section 3.2 we examine firms’ innovation output using propensity score matched pairs of CVC- and IVC-backed IPO firms. In Section 3.3 we extend our baseline analysis and evaluate the innovation output of all VC-backed firms (as opposed to comparing only firms that eventually went public) in a difference-in-differences setting. In Section 3.4 we explore the investment patterns of CVCs and IVCs to address alternative interpretations of our main results.  \n\n### 3.1 Baseline findings  \n\nWe start by examining the innovation output of CVC- and IVC-backed firms prior to IPO. Because young entrepreneurial firms’ innovation is relatively sporadic, we consider a cumulative innovation over the three-year period prior to the IPO date (see, e.g., Lerner, Sorensen, and Stromberg 2011 for a similar setting). To evaluate the effect of CVC backing, we use three measures for the degree of CVC participation: CVC Backing Dummy, which equals one if the firm is classified as a CVC-backed IPO and zero if the firm is classified as an IVC-backed IPO, Number of CVCs, which counts the number of CVCs in an investing VC syndicate, and CVC Share, which measures the percentage investment made by the CVCs within a VC syndicate. We control for a number of firm characteristics shown in the literature that affect a firm's innovation output as described in Section 2.4. The control variables are measured as of the entrepreneurial firm's IPO year. We include industry and year fixed effects and cluster standard errors at the lead VC firm level. The observational unit in this analysis is the IPO firm.  \n\nTable 3 reports the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression results for preIPO innovation output of CVC- and IVC-backed IPO firms.11 In Panel A, the dependent variable is the total number of patents filed by the IPO firm in the three years prior to its IPO year. The coefficient estimates of the three CVC backing variables are all positive and statistically significant, suggesting that CVC backing is associated with a higher level of innovation output of the firm three years prior to IPO. Economically, based on the coefficient estimate of CVC Backing Dummy in Column (1), a CVC-backed IPO firm generates $26.9\\%$ more patents than an IVC-backed IPO firm in the three years prior to IPO. Based on the coefficient estimate of Number of CVCs reported in Column (2), one additional CVC investor in the investing VC syndicate increases the firm's number of patents by $15.9\\%$ in the three years prior to IPO.  \n\nPanel B of Table 3 presents a similar analysis for the patent quality measure. The coefficient estimates of CVC backing variables are all positive and significant, suggesting that CVC-backed firms generate patents with higher quality (i.e., larger impact). Based on the coefficient estimate of CVC Backing Dummy in Column (4), patents generated by CVC-backed firms in the three years prior to IPO receive $17.6\\%$ more citations compared with those generated by IVC-backed firms.  \n\nTable3 Pre-IPO innovation productivity of CVC- and IVC-backed IPO firms   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"3\">Panel A: Ln(patents)</td><td colspan=\"3\">Panel B: Ln(citations/patent)</td></tr><tr><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>CVCbackingdummy</td><td>0.269***</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.176**</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.02)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(2.21)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Number of CVCs</td><td></td><td>0.159***</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.066*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.91)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(1.75)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CVC share</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.618** (2.17)</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.471** (2.09)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Ln(total assets)</td><td>0.201***</td><td>0.192***</td><td>0.212***</td><td>0.060*</td><td>0.060*</td><td>0.067**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(1.82)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">ROA</td><td>(4.72)</td><td>(4.59)</td><td>(5.04)</td><td></td><td>(1.83)</td><td>(2.03)</td></tr><tr><td>0.061</td><td>0.085</td><td>0.015</td><td>-0.055</td><td>-0.068</td><td>0.080</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">R&D in total assets</td><td>(0.34) 1.564***</td><td>(0.47) 1.569***</td><td>(0.08) 1.577***</td><td>(0.38) 0.348</td><td>(0.47) 0.346</td><td>(0.55)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.78)</td><td>(2.76)</td><td>(1.12)</td><td>(1.11)</td><td>0.359</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">PPE in total assets</td><td>(2.78) 0.136</td><td>0.153</td><td>0.129</td><td>0.148</td><td>0.151</td><td>(1.14) 0.143</td></tr><tr><td>(1.03)</td><td>(1.15)</td><td>(0.97)</td><td>(1.24)</td><td>(1.26)</td><td>(1.20)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Leverage</td><td>0.286</td><td>0.249</td><td>0.325</td><td>-0.394**</td><td>-0.397**</td><td>-0.415**</td></tr><tr><td>(1.18)</td><td>(1.03)</td><td>(1.33)</td><td>(2.33)</td><td>(2.34)</td><td>(2.46)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">CE in total assets</td><td>0.044</td><td>0.058</td><td>0.033</td><td>0.361</td><td>0.369</td><td>0.352</td></tr><tr><td>(0.14)</td><td>(0.18)</td><td>(0.10)</td><td>(1.18)</td><td>(1.21)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">HHI</td><td>-0.261</td><td>0.254</td><td>0.315</td><td>0.168</td><td>0.176</td><td>(1.15)</td></tr><tr><td>(0.80)</td><td>(0.78)</td><td></td><td>(0.54)</td><td>(0.57)</td><td>-0.205</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">HHI2</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.96)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(0.66)</td></tr><tr><td>0.165</td><td>0.158</td><td>0.204</td><td>0.007</td><td>0.009</td><td>0.036</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Tobin's q</td><td>(0.53)</td><td>(0.51)</td><td>(0.65)</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>(0.03)</td><td>(0.13)</td></tr><tr><td>0.016**</td><td>0.016**</td><td>0.016**</td><td>0.014*</td><td>0.014*</td><td>0.014*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">KZ index</td><td>(2.08)</td><td>(2.08)</td><td>(2.04)</td><td>(1.88)</td><td>(1.93)</td><td>(1.87)</td></tr><tr><td>0.004</td><td>-0.004</td><td>-0.003</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.004</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Ln(age at IPO)</td><td>(0.39)</td><td>(0.44)</td><td>(0.34)</td><td>(0.52)</td><td>(0.51)</td><td>(0.57)</td></tr><tr><td>0.021</td><td>-0.020</td><td>-0.022</td><td>0.011</td><td>0.010</td><td>0.011</td></tr><tr><td>Year fixed effects</td><td>(0.56)</td><td>(0.53)</td><td>(0.58)</td><td>(0.31)</td><td>(0.29)</td><td>(0.24)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry fixed effects</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.16</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the results of pre-IPO innovation analysis. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the total number of patents generated three years prior to the IPO in Panel A and the natural logarithm of the numberof citations per patent for the patents generated three years prior to the IPO in Panel B. The main variables of interest are a CVC backing dummy, the number of CVCs, and CVC share in the total VC investment. The set of control variables includes the natural logarithm of firm assets, return on assets, R&D scaled by firm assets, PPE scaled by firm assets, firm leverage, capital expenditure scaled by firm assets, the HHI of industry sales index, the HHI squared, Tobin’s q, the KZ index, and the natural logarithm of firm age at the IPO year. The unit of observation is IPOfirm.Robust $t$ -statistics are reported in parentheses. $***$ $^{**}$ , and \\* indicate significance at $1\\%$ ， $5\\%$ , and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nWe are aware of the possible look-ahead bias introduced by taking the values of control variables at the firm's IPO year in the above specifications. Unfortunately, the financial information for IPO firms prior to going public is not available. We include these variables to control for firm characteristics that can potentially affect innovation productivity. However, given the above reservations, we do not draw any inferences based on these control variables' coefficient estimates. The analysis without controls for IPO firm characteristics results in both statistically and economically stronger results. For example, after excluding controls for IPO firm characteristics, the coefficient estimate of CVC Backing Dummy is 0.343( $(t$ -statistics $=4.18$ )in Column (1), where the dependent variable is patent quantity, and the coefficient estimate of  \n\nCVC Backing Dummy is 0.227 ( $\\mathbf{\\rho}_{t}$ -statistics $=3.18$ ) in Column (4), where the dependent variable is patent quality.  \n\nTable 4 presents the analysis of the post-IPO innovation output of CVC- and IVC-backed firms. The dependent variables are based on the innovation output over the four-year period post IPO (including the IPO year). Panel A suggests that CVC-backed firms have higher innovation quantity in the years post IPO. The results are both economically and statistically significant. The coefficient estimate of CVC Backing Dummy in Column (1) suggests that a CVC-backed firm is able to generate $44.9\\%$ more patents than an IVC-backed firm within the first four years after IPO. One additional CVC investor in the VC syndicate increases the firm's number of patents by $21.9\\%$ within the first four years after IPO.  \n\nIn Panel B, we evaluate the impact of CVC backing on the quality of patents generated by the firms post IPO. The coefficient estimates of CVC-backing variables are all positive and significant, suggesting that CVC-backed IPO firms generate patents with higher quality. Specifically, as reported in Column (4), patents generated by CVC-backed firms within the first four years post IPO receive $13.2\\%$ more citations than those generated by IVC-backed frms. 12  \n\nIn Table 4 we control for a comprehensive set of industry and firm characteristics that may affect firm innovation output. Consistent with previous literature, we find that firms that are larger (more total assets), have fewer tangible assets (lower PPE in total assets), have higher growth options (higher Tobin's q), and have lower leverage are more innovative. A larger R&D spending, which can be viewed as a larger innovation input, is associated with more innovation output. Product market competition, profitability, and financial constraints do not significantly affect an IPO firm's innovation output.  \n\nTo further capture the underlying quality and fundamental nature of innovation output, we follow Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2001) and define two alternative innovation proxies: patent generality and patent originality. Patents that are cited by a wider array of technology classes of patents are viewed as having greater generality. We define a patent's generality score as one minus the Herfindahl index of the three-digit technology class distribution of all the patents that cite it. The higher a patent's generality score, the more the patent is being drawn upon by a diverse array of subsequent patents. Similarly, patents that cite a wider array of technology classes of patents are viewed as having greater originality. We define a patent's originality score as one minus the Herfindahl index of the three-digit technology class distribution of all the patents it cites. The higher a patent's originality score, the more the patent draws  \n\nTable4 Post-IPO innovation productivity of CVC- and IVC-backed firms   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">Panel A: Ln(patents)</td><td colspan=\"3\">Panel B: Ln(citations/patent)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td>CVC backing dummy</td><td>0.449***</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.132*</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.01)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(1.91)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of CVCs</td><td></td><td>0.219*** (3.66)</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.057* (1.64)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CVC share</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.812**</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.434**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(2.19)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(2.10)</td></tr><tr><td>Ln(total assets)</td><td>0.365***</td><td>0.358***</td><td>0.387***</td><td>0.079**</td><td>0.078**</td><td>0.083**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>(6.60)</td><td>(6.47)</td><td>(7.00)</td><td>(2.21)</td><td>(2.18)</td><td>(2.35)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.214</td><td>0.220</td><td>0.120</td><td>-0.035</td><td>0.039</td><td>0.047</td></tr><tr><td>R&D in total assets</td><td>(1.01)</td><td>(1.02)</td><td>(0.56)</td><td>(-0.25)</td><td>(-0.28)</td><td>(-0.34)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1.732**</td><td>1.734**</td><td>1.743**</td><td>0.420</td><td>0.420</td><td>0.432</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.51)</td><td>(2.50)</td><td>(2.47)</td><td>(1.48)</td><td>(1.48)</td><td>(1.53)</td></tr><tr><td>PPE in total assets</td><td>-0.459**</td><td>-0.476**</td><td>-0.443**</td><td>0.242</td><td>0.246</td><td>0.240</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.47)</td><td>(2.55)</td><td>(2.36)</td><td>(1.47)</td><td>(1.49)</td><td>(1.46)</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>-0.632**</td><td>-0.603*</td><td>-0.711**</td><td>-0.660***</td><td>-0.657***</td><td>-0.671***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.03)</td><td>(1.93)</td><td>(2.26)</td><td>(3.11)</td><td>(3.09)</td><td>(-3.18)</td></tr><tr><td>CE in total assets</td><td>0.524</td><td>0.547</td><td>0.513</td><td>0.288</td><td>0.294</td><td>0.278</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1.13)</td><td>(1.19)</td><td>(1.11)</td><td>(0.71)</td><td>(0.73)</td><td>(0.69)</td></tr><tr><td>HHI</td><td>-0.440</td><td>0.443</td><td>0.526</td><td>-0.007</td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.036</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.99)</td><td>(1.00)</td><td>(1.18)</td><td>(-0.02)</td><td>(-0.03)</td><td>(0.11)</td></tr><tr><td>HHI2</td><td>0.086</td><td>0.082</td><td>0.144</td><td>0.245</td><td>0.245</td><td>-0.220</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.20)</td><td>(0.19)</td><td>(0.34)</td><td>(-0.73)</td><td>(-0.73)</td><td>(-0.66)</td></tr><tr><td>Tobin's q</td><td>0.037***</td><td>0.038***</td><td>0.038***</td><td>0.011**</td><td>0.011**</td><td>0.011**</td></tr><tr><td>KZ index</td><td>(5.59)</td><td>(5.61)</td><td>(5.46)</td><td>(2.04)</td><td>(2.09)</td><td>(2.03)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.004</td><td>-0.004</td><td>-0.003</td><td>0.002</td><td>0.002</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>Ln(Age at IPO)</td><td>(0.38)</td><td>(0.43)</td><td>(0.30)</td><td>(0.18)</td><td>(0.17)</td><td>(0.20)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.118**</td><td>-0.118**</td><td>-0.121**</td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.010</td><td>-0.010</td></tr><tr><td>Year fixed effects</td><td>(2.24)</td><td>(2.24)</td><td>(2.29)</td><td>(0.24)</td><td>(0.25)</td><td>(0.24)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry fixed effects</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.330</td><td>0.329</td><td>0.325</td><td>0.208</td><td>0.207</td><td>0.207</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the results of post-IPO innovation analysis.

We then average the individual patents’ generality and originality scores at the IPO firm level and compute Generality and Originality, respectively.  \n\nTable 5 reports the results of our baseline regressions with the dependent variable replaced by Generality in Panel A and by Originality in Panel B. Because generality and originality scores are bounded between 0 and 1, we use a Tobit model to estimate the effect of CVC financing. For IPO firms that generate no patents in either the three years before or the four years after IPO, their patent generality and originality scores are undefined and are therefore treated as missing. To save space, we suppress the coefficient estimates of all controls.

The dependent variable is the generality score of patents in Panel A and the originality score of patents in Panel B. The main variables of interest are a CVC backing dummy, the number of CVCs,and CVC share.Other independent variables include the natural logarithm of firm assets,return on assets,R&D scaled byfirm assets,PPE scaled by firm assets,firmleverage,capital expenditure scaled by firm assets, the Herfindahl index, the Herfindahl index squared, Tobin's q, the KZ index, and the natural logarithm of firm age at IPO year. The unit of observation is IPO firm.Robust $t$ statisticsarereportedin parentheses. $***$ ， $^{**}$ , and \\* indicate significance at $1\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nprior to IPO and Columns (4)-(6) report the results for patents produced after IPO. In Panel A, the coefficient estimates of the CVC backing variables are all positive and significant, except for that in Column (6), suggesting that patents generated by CVC-backed IPO firms are cited by subsequent patents that are from a wider array of technology classes than those produced by IVC-backed IPO firms. In Panel B, the coefficient estimates of the CVC backing variables are all positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level. The evidence indicates that patents generated by CVC-backed IPO firms have a greater originality score.  \n\nIn an untabulated analysis, we also undertake an industry-by-industry analysis to examine the industries in which the positive effect of CVC financing on innovation is more pronounced. Following the existing innovation literature (e.g., Atanassov, Nanda, and Seru 2007; Tian and Wang 2014), we group our sample firms into four categories based on the technological nature of patents: (1) Pharmaceutical, medical instrumentation, and chemicals (hereafter Pharmaceutical), (2) Computers, communications, and electrical (hereafter Computers and electrical), (3) Software programming and internet applications (hereafter Software), and (4) Other miscellaneous patents (hereafter Low-tech). If a firm has no patents, we classify it into one of the above four categories on the basis of the type of patents that are most frequently produced by the firm's industry. We find that the Pharmaceutical and the Computers and electrical industries generate a larger number of patents and their patents receive more citations than do the other two groups of industries. We also find that the positive effect of CVC financing on the innovation output of the entrepreneurial firms is mainly focused in these two groups of industries. CVC-backed firms, however, do not appear to be more innovative than IVC-backed firms if they are in the other two groups of industries that are overall less innovative.  \n\nFinally, we examine a subsample of IPO firms that generate at least one patent prior to or after IPO, given the concern that a large number of firms never file a patent in our sample. In an untabulated analysis, we find that our baseline results continue to hold in this subsample. For example, the coefficient estimate of CVC Backing Dummy is 0.357 $(t$ -statistics $=2.38\\$ )inthe regression in which the dependent variable is the total number of patents generated by the IPO firm in the first four years after it goes public.  \n\nOverall, the evidence presented above suggests that CVC financing is positively related to the innovation output of their portfolio firms, both prior to and after IPO. CVC-backed IPO firms generate both a larger number of patents and patents with higher quality compared with IVC-backed firms.  \n\n### 3.2 Propensity score matching analysis  \n\nWhereas the documented difference in the innovation output between CVCand IVC-backed firms appears to be due to the CVCs' ability to better nurture innovation, our baseline results could also be attributed to other potential interpretations. One possible interpretation is that CVCs and IVCs might invest in and/or take to the IPO market radically different types of firms. In other words, CVCs may have superior selection abilities to identify entrepreneurial firms with high innovation potential to begin with.  \n\nTo gauge how CVC- and IVC-backed firms differ in their observable characteristics, we report the univariate comparisons between these two groups of firms in Columns (1)-(3) of Table 6 Panel A. The results suggest that CVCbacked firms are slightly larger, less profitable, spend significantly more on R&D, and have less fixed assets. They come from more concentrated industries and have higher growth options (Tobin's q). Given that the characteristics of these two groups of firms are quite different, a regression-based analysis is likely to provide us with an inaccurate estimate of CVCs’ impact on the innovation productivity of entrepreneurial firms. In this section, we compare the innovation output of CVC- and IVC-backed firms within the propensity score matched pairs of entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nThe propensity score matching approach allows us to disentangle the treatment and the selection effect of CvC financing on the innovation output of entrepreneurial firms based on observable firm characteristics. The results of our baseline analysis are consistent with both selection and treatment: the superior ability of CVCs to nurture innovation and the superior skill of CVCs to select firms with higher innovation potential. To disentangle these two effects, an ideal experiment would be to evaluate the innovation of entrepreneurial firms under the random assignment of IVC and CVC investors. Although such an experiment is not feasible to implement, the propensity score matching analysis allows us to minimize the effect of selection based on observables and is therefore the second-best approach.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Postmatch Prematch Difference (5) Postmatch IVC-backed (4) Difference (3) Prematch IVC-backed (2) CVC-backed (1）</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nWe use a nearest-neighbor matching implementation of the propensity score matching approach originally developed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983).13 The propensity scores are estimated based on a probit regression at the IPO firm level with the dependent variable being a binary variable equal to one for CVCbacked firms and zero for IVC-backed firms. We use a set of control variables measured at the IPO year as matching dimensions. We incorporate industry and year fixed effects to absorb any time- and industry-specific heterogeneity not captured by firm characteristics. The probit model is estimated across 1,700 firms containing non-missing data for all of the matching dimension variables. We present the estimation results in Column (1) of Table 6, Panel B, labeled \"Prematch.\" We observe the same significant differences between CVC- and IVC-backed firm characteristics as with those reported in Column (3) in Panel A. The results also show that the specification captures a significant amount of variation in the choice variable, as indicated by a pseudo- $\\cdot R^{2}$ of $16.1\\%$ and a $p$ -valuefromthe $\\chi^{2}$ test of the overall model fitness well below 0.01.  \n\nWe then use the propensity score (i.e., the predicted probability) from the “Prematch\" probit regression and perform a nearest-neighbor propensity score matching with replacement. Because the number of IVC-backed firms significantly exceeds the number of CVC-backed firms, we use the three nearest neighboring IVC-backed firms that come from the same industry-year IPO group as our main control group firms.  \n\nWe conduct diagnostic tests to assess the accuracy of the matching procedure. First, we report the univariate comparison between CVC- and IVC-backed firms for the matched pairs and report the results in Columns (4) and (5) of Panel A. We observe statistically insignificant differences between IVC- and CVC-backed firms across all but one characteristic. Next, we rerun the probit model restricted to the matched sample and reported the results in Column (2) of Panel B, labeled “Postmatch.\" The magnitude of the probit regression coefficients decline dramatically. None of the industry and year dummies is statistically significant in the “Postmatch” column, whereas a majority of them are statistically significant in the “Prematch\" column. In addition, the pseudo$R^{2}$ drops dramatically from $16.1\\%$ prior to the matching to $1.3\\%$ post matching, and a $\\chi^{2}$ test for the overall model fitness shows that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that all of the coefficient estimates of independent variables are zero (with a $p$ -value of 0.99). In both diagnostic tests, the only dimension of the CVC-backed firms that we cannot match well with IVC-backed firms is the ROA.We observe that even after the match CVC-backed firms are less profitable than are IVC-backed firms. However, the fact that CVC-backed firms are at earlier stages of their development and therefore are less profitable only biases our innovation analysis against our finding a treatment effect of CVC financing. Thus, the matching process removes meaningful differences along observable dimensions between these two groups of firms.  \n\nTable 7 reports the innovation output analysis using the propensity score matched pairs of IPO firms. We report a wide set of results for different numbers of nearest neighbors used and different limitations on the pool of control firms (year, industry, or industry-year). Panel A reports the quality of innovation output. We find that, even after we non-parametrically control for firm characteristics (using propensity score matching), CVC-backed IPO firms still have a higher innovation output, both pre- and post-IPO. The CVC-backed firms obtain $25\\%\\sim40\\%$ more patents pre-IPO and $38\\%\\sim60\\%$ more patents post-IPO. We report the innovation quality results in Panel B. CVC-backed firms also tend to generate better quality patents pre-IPO and about the same quality of patents post-IPO than do IVC-backed firms.  \n\nIn summary, the findings from our propensity score matching analysis suggest that CVC-backed firms are more innovative. One caution is that, because the lack of pre-IPO financial variables does not allow us to match CVC- and IVC-backed firms based on pretreatment (before the firms receive the first round VC financing) firm characteristics, we cannot fully eliminate superior CVC selection ability as an alternative explanation for our results. However, given the natural bias of entrepreneurs against CVC investors due to potential conflicts of interest (Hellmann 2002), and the fact that CVCs tend to co-invest with IVCs who typically lead the investment syndicate, we find that our results are unlikely to be entirely driven by CVCs’ superior selection ability. Overall, our propensity score analysis suggests that there is a significant treatment effect of CVC backing on innovation by entrepreneurial firms backed by them.  \n\n### 3.3 The difference-in-differences approach  \n\nA reasonable concern regarding the analysis so far is that our study only focuses on the sample of entrepreneurial firms that eventually go public. It is possible that our results are driven by the fact that, compared to IVCs, CVCs are more likely to bring their most innovative frms public. It is also possible that our analysis based on the sample of IPO firms introduces survivorship bias issues. Therefore, drawing conclusions solely based on an analysis of IPO firms could be misleading.  \n\nTo address these concerns, we now implement our analysis of innovation intensity based on the entire universe of VC-backed entrepreneurial firms from  \n\nTable7 Propensity score matching results   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Nearestneighbors</td><td>Exact match</td><td colspan=\"3\">Pre-IPO</td><td colspan=\"3\">Post-IPO</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>CVC-</td><td>IVC-</td><td>Difference</td><td>CVC-</td><td>IVC-</td><td>Difference</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Panel A: Ln(patents)</td></tr><tr><td>Unmatched</td><td></td><td>1.215</td><td>0.605</td><td>0.610***</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.094</td><td>0.834***</td></tr><tr><td>One</td><td>No restriction</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.814</td><td>0.401***</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.328</td><td>0.601***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.974</td><td>0.242*</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.496</td><td>0.432**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Year</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.897</td><td>0.318**</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.392</td><td>0.537***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry and year</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.854</td><td>0.361**</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.421</td><td>0.508***</td></tr><tr><td>Three</td><td>No restriction</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.994</td><td>0.222*</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.572</td><td>0.356**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.958</td><td>0.257**</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.505</td><td>0.424***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Year</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.922</td><td>0.294**</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.459</td><td>0.470***</td></tr><tr><td>Five</td><td>Industry and year</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.978</td><td>0.237**</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.519</td><td>0.410***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>No restriction</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.965</td><td>0.250***</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.527</td><td>0.401***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.978</td><td>0.237**</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.543</td><td>0.386***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>1.215</td><td>0.916</td><td>0.299***</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.474</td><td>0.455***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry and year</td><td>1.215</td><td>0.963</td><td>0.252**</td><td>1.929</td><td>1.490</td><td>0.438***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Panel B: Ln(citations per patent)</td></tr><tr><td>Unmatched</td><td></td><td>1.007</td><td>0.638</td><td>0.369***</td><td>1.087</td><td>0.837</td><td>0.250***</td></tr><tr><td>One</td><td>No restriction</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.850</td><td>0.157</td><td>1.087</td><td>0.899</td><td>0.188**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.933</td><td>0.074</td><td>1.087</td><td>1.019</td><td>0.067</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Year</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.772</td><td>0.235**</td><td>1.087</td><td>0.921</td><td>0.166</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry and year</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.755</td><td>0.252**</td><td>1.087</td><td>0.992</td><td>0.095</td></tr><tr><td>Three</td><td>No restriction</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.856</td><td>0.151</td><td>1.087</td><td>1.010</td><td>0.077</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.928</td><td>0.079</td><td>1.087</td><td>1.026</td><td>0.060</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Year</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.827</td><td>0.180*</td><td>1.087</td><td>0.950</td><td>0.136</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry and year</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.859</td><td>0.148</td><td>1.087</td><td>1.022</td><td>0.065</td></tr><tr><td>Five</td><td>No restriction</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.829</td><td>0.178*</td><td>1.087</td><td>0.961</td><td>0.126</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.849</td><td>0.158*</td><td>1.087</td><td>0.988</td><td>0.099</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Year</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.840</td><td>0.167*</td><td>1.087</td><td>0.959</td><td>0.128</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Industry and year</td><td>1.007</td><td>0.848</td><td>0.159*</td><td>1.087</td><td>1.010</td><td>0.077</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the differences in innovation output based on a sample in which CVC-backed IPO firms are matched to IVC-backed IPO firms using the propensity score matching algorithm with various restrictions.

For brevity, we only report results based on patent counts. Our analysis of patent citations produces qualitatively similar results.  \n\nTable 8 Panel A reports the univariate comparisons of patent counts of CVCand IVC-backed firms. In Column (1), the sample includes all VC-backed entrepreneurial firms. We find that CVC-backed firms on average generate 0.6 more patents. The differences are statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level. In Columns (2)-(5), we break down the sample based on the exit outcomes of entrepreneurial firms. Specifically, in Column (2), we report the results of firms that eventually go public; in Column (3), we report firms that are acquired by another company; in Column (4), we report firms that are written off; and in Column (5), we report firms still under active VC investment. We observe that, regardless of the firms’ exit outcomes and current status, CVC-backed firms generate a larger number of patents than do IVC-backed firms.  \n\nSimilar to our main analysis that is based on a sample of IPO firms, our study based on the sample of all VC-backed entrepreneurial firms is also subject to the concern that the results are due to CVCs’ superior selection ability. We explore the difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis around the first VC investment year that mitigates this concern to a significant extent. Specifically, we construct a panel data set that captures entrepreneurial firms? annual innovation output around the first VC investment year and estimate the following regression:  \n\n$$\nI n n o v a t i o n_{i,t}=\\beta_{s}\\sum_{s=1}^{5}A f t e r_{i,t}^{s}+\\gamma_{s}\\sum_{s=1}^{5}A f t e r_{i,t}^{s}\\times C V C_{i}+Y e a r_{t}+F i r m_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $A f t e r_{i,t}^{s}$ is a dummy variable that equals one if year $t$ .s $s$ years after the first investment round in firm $i$ and zero otherwise. $C V C_{i}$ is a dummy variable that equals one if the first investment round is CVC-backed and zero otherwise. The coefficient estimates of $\\beta_{s}$ reflect the changes in portfolio firms' innovation output since the first VC investment round. The coefficients of interest are $\\gamma_{s}$ ， which capture the incremental innovation output associated with CVC backing in the years after the first investment round. The sample covers a five-year period for each entrepreneurial firm starting from the date of the first financing round. The specification controls for time-invariant heterogeneity across CVCand IVC-backed firms via the firm fixed effects. The calendar year fixed effects capture the aggregate changes in patenting rates in the U.S. economy. We cluster standard errors by the first investment round year.  \n\nTable 8 Panel B reports the results of our DiD analysis based on the firm's exit type. Column (1) includes all portfolio firms; Column (2) reports the results for firms that eventually go public; Column (3) reports the results for acquired firms; Column (4) reports the results for written-off firms; and Column (5) reports the results for firms still under active VC investment. We find that $\\gamma_{s}$ are all positive and significant two years after the first investment round (see Column (1)). CVC-backed entrepreneurial firms exhibit a substantially larger jump in innovation output compared with IVC-backed firms after the first CVC (IVC) investment year. More interestingly, the innovation output of CVC- and IVC-backed firms are similar during the first financing round year as $\\gamma_{1}$ is insignificant in all columns. However, CVC-backed firms seem to quickly gain momentum and increasingly outperform IVC-backed firms in subsequent years. The magnitudes of $\\gamma_{s}$ coefficients are monotonically increasing from $\\gamma_{2}$ and are statistically significant. We find a similar finding for entrepreneurial firms that go public, that are acquired, and that are still under active VC investment. The only exception is the written-off firms that appear in Column (4), for which CVC- and IVC-backed firms do not exhibit any significant differences in innovation output after the first investment round.  \n\n![](images/4f4e28a1cebed38d77ccb1c3c5f5e260cf88425d58a3e6249ab794671d68c56b.jpg)  \nPanel A: Number of patents  \n\n![](images/d17cbf530ac2d995871dc7939c2c8ba703f5dbd8f03404a70cb323694f8a707c.jpg)  \nPanel B: Citations per patent   \nFigure1 Innovation around the first CvC (IvC) investment year This figure shows patterns for patent counts (PanelA) and citations per patent (Panel B).

However, after the first VC investment round, these two lines start to diverge with the line representing CVC-backed firms well above the one representing IVC-backed firms.  \n\nOverall, the evidence presented in this section suggests that CVC-backed entrepreneurial firms exhibit a substantially larger jump in innovation output compared with IVC-backed firms after the first CVC (IVC) investment year.  \n\n### 3.4 Investment patterns  \n\nIn the above analysis for the entire sample of VC-backed entrepreneurial firms, we attempt to eliminate portfolio firm heterogeneity using the full set of entrepreneurial firm fixed effects. To further ensure that our results are not driven by CVCs strategically investing in more mature firms that are capable of producing more (and better quality) patents, in this section we analyze whether CVCs indeed invest in more mature firms at the financing round date.  \n\nTable 9 reports the results of a probit analysis that uses VC round-by-round investments data. The observation unit is a financing round. The dependent variable is a dummy that equals one for financing rounds backed by CVCs and zero for financing rounds backed by IVCs. The independent variables can be classified into three categories. First, we analyze individual firmround characteristics, such as entrepreneurial firm age at the round date, round number, total amount received by the firm this round, and total amount of prior investment. These variables reflect the maturity of the firm.  \n\nSecond, we control for entrepreneurial firms’ industry characteristics. Because we do not observe balance sheet data for portfolio firms, we measure their industry characteristics using aggregate variables for firms that are already publicly traded. Specifically, based on an entrepreneurial firm's SIC code, we construct industry-wide variables by averaging the characteristics of public firms in the same industry in the year prior to the financing round. These industry-wide variables include capital expenditures and R&D that are likely to capture the growth option features of the industry, sales growth over the three years prior to the financing round that reflects past industry growth, equalweighted industry portfolio return over the six months prior to the financing round date that captures the effect of hot versus cold industries,the beta of the industry portfolio over the 36 months prior to the financing-round date that capture the systematic risk of the entrepreneurial firm, and the industry Herfindahl index and the market share of the largest firm in the industry based on prior-year sales that evaluate the degree of competition faced by the entrepreneurial firm. These variables allow us to compare the industry characteristics of CVC- versus IVC-backed firms.  \n\nFinally, we control for the reputation of IVCs who invest in the entrepreneurial firm prior to the round considered using three proxies: VC age, total number of rounds the VC has invested, and total amount the VC has invested by the financing round date.  \n\nTable 9 reports our results with the industry characteristics being constructed based on the 2-digit SIC industry definition.1 First, we find that CVCs tend to invest in younger firms at earlier rounds: the coefficient estimates of firm age and round number are negative and significant at the $1\\%$ level.CvCs also invest in firms that require significantly larger investments (those with smaller prior investment). Second, CVCs provide funding to more capital and R&Dintensive firms than do IVCs. The positive and significant coefficient estimate of industry beta suggests that CVC-backed firms come from riskier industries. These industries also tend to be more competitive as the coefficient estimates of the Herfindahl index and market share of the largest firm in the industry are negative.  \n\nTable9 Patterns of CvC investments: Effect of firm and industry characteristics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">CVC-backedfinancinground</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Firm characteristics</td></tr><tr><td>Firm age at round date</td><td>-0.016***</td><td>-0.017***</td><td>-0.017***</td><td>-0.016***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.97)</td><td>(5.22)</td><td>(5.17)</td><td>(4.93)</td></tr><tr><td>Round number</td><td>-0.034***</td><td>-0.036***</td><td>-0.037***</td><td>-0.034***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.52)</td><td>(3.83)</td><td>(3.92)</td><td>(3.51) 0.302***</td></tr><tr><td>Log dollar amount invested this round</td><td>0.301***</td><td>0.293***</td><td>0.298***</td><td>(23.90)</td></tr><tr><td>Log total prior investment</td><td>(23.86) -0.011***</td><td>(24.07) -0.011***</td><td>(24.04) -0.010**</td><td>-0.011***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.59)</td><td>(2.59)</td><td>(2.47)</td><td>(2.60)</td></tr><tr><td>Averageindustry characteristics</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Capital expenditures</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1.950***</td><td>2.067***</td><td>2.126***</td><td>1.982***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.43)</td><td>(3.75)</td><td>(3.86)</td><td>(3.47)</td></tr><tr><td>R&D</td><td>0.034***</td><td>0.034***</td><td>0.034***</td><td>0.035***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.83)</td><td>(3.88)</td><td>(3.82)</td><td>(3.99)</td></tr><tr><td>Sales growth over past 3 yr.</td><td>0.276***</td><td>0.254***</td><td>0.230***</td><td>0.264***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.28)</td><td>(3.04)</td><td>(2.72)</td><td>(3.12)</td></tr><tr><td>Return on ind. portfolio over prior 6 mo.</td><td>0.045</td><td>0.027</td><td>0.020</td><td>0.044</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1.20)</td><td>(0.72)</td><td>(0.52)</td><td>(1.18)</td></tr><tr><td>Beta</td><td>0.053***</td><td>0.057***</td><td>0.058***</td><td>0.054***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.99)</td><td>(3.24)</td><td>(3.29)</td><td>(3.06)</td></tr><tr><td>HHI of industry sales</td><td>-0.694**</td><td>-0.680**</td><td>-0.627**</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(2.20)</td><td>(2.18)</td><td>(1.99)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Largest market share (sales)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.390**</td></tr><tr><td>Average reputation of existing IVCs</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(2.46)</td></tr><tr><td>IVCs age</td><td>-0.016***</td><td></td><td></td><td>-0.017***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(7.18)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(7.22)</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of rounds invested</td><td></td><td>-0.001***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total amount invested (Smil.)</td><td></td><td>(6.70)</td><td>-0.001***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(6.67)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Internet company dummy</td><td>0.139***</td><td>0.145***</td><td>0.147***</td><td>0.133***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.51)</td><td>(4.84)</td><td>(4.75)</td><td>(4.39)</td></tr><tr><td>Startup/seed stage at first rd. of VC financing</td><td>0.250***</td><td>0.259***</td><td>0.247***</td><td>0.247***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.90)</td><td>(4.04)</td><td>(3.87)</td><td>(3.86)</td></tr><tr><td>Early stage at first round of VC financing</td><td>0.341***</td><td>0.354***</td><td>0.336***</td><td>0.339***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.85)</td><td>(5.04)</td><td>(4.79)</td><td>(4.83)</td></tr><tr><td>Expansion stage at first round of VC financing</td><td>0.214***</td><td>0.231***</td><td>0.220***</td><td>0.212***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.39)</td><td>(3.66)</td><td>(3.49)</td><td>(3.36)</td></tr><tr><td>Later stage at first round of VC financing</td><td>0.225***</td><td>0.238***</td><td>0.229***</td><td>0.223***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.88)</td><td>(4.10)</td><td>(3.97)</td><td>(3.84)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>26,359</td><td>26,358</td><td>26,358</td><td>26,359</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Pseudo R2</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.12</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nThis table reports the results of the probit analysis that explores CVC investment patterns. The data set contains round investments by CVCs and IVCs. The dependent variable is equal to one for first CVC-firm round of financing and zero otherwise. Only first investment rounds by individual VCs are considered. The independent variables include (1) entrepreneurial firm characteristics, (2) entrepreneurial firm industry characteristics, and (3) reputation of the existing IVCs at the financing round.

Although we cannot entirely rule out a selection effect, our evidence obtained from a propensity score matching analysis of CVC- versus IVC-backed IPO firms and the DiD analysis of all VC-backed entrepreneurial firms suggests that these findings are more likely due to a treatment effect; that is, CVCs appear to have a better ability to nurture innovation in their portfolio firms.  \n\n## 4. Possible Mechanisms  \n\nOur analysis so far shows that CVC-backed firms are more innovative than are IVC-backed firms, although they are younger, riskier, and less profitable. The next natural question is what the economic mechanisms are that allow CVCs to better nurture innovation as compared with IVCs. In this section, we examine two potential mechanisms: (1) the technological fit between CVCs' parent companies and the entrepreneurial firms backed by them, motivated by the theories of Robinson (2008) and Fulghieri and Sevilir (2009), and (2) tolerance for failure, motivated by Manso (2011) theory.  \n\n### 4.1 Technological fit  \n\nFulghieri and Sevilir (2009) argue that under certain circumstances firms move from internal to external organization of projects to increase the speed of product innovation and to obtain a competitive advantage with respect to rival frms in their industry. Similarly, Robinson (2008) shows that firms would prefer to implement “long-shot\" projects through strategic alliances rather than internally organized projects. He shows that strategic alliances help overcome the incentive problems associated with implementing these projects. By extension, entrepreneurial firms that are in close proximity to the technological expertise of the CVC corporate parent may obtain significant advantages in pursuing risky, long-shot innovation. Furthermore, as we argued previously, CVCs that operate in the same technological space with their entrepreneurial firms possess superior industry and technology expertise, so that such CVCs are better able to develop and nurture new ventures’ technologies and product market prospects compared with CVCs that do not have such a “technological fit’ (and also compared with IVCs).  \n\nIn this section, we empirically study whether the technological fit between the CVC's parent company and the entrepreneurial firm is an underlying economic mechanism. Specifically, we examine whether a technological fit contributes to the superior innovation output of CVC-backed entrepreneurial firms. We define a technological fit dummy that equals one if the CVC parent company and the entrepreneurial firm share the same Fama-French industry and zero otherwise.16 We expect CVC-backed entrepreneurial firms with a technological fit to be more innovative than both CVC-backed firms without a technological fit and IVC-backed firms.  \n\nTable 10 presents the result of our analysis. In Panel A we repeat our baseline regressions but split the CVC-backing dummy into two dummy variables: CVC w/o technological fit is a dummy that equals one if an entrepreneurial firm is backed by a CVC and the firm has a technological fit with at least one CVC parent company and zero otherwise. Similarly, CVC w/o technological fit is a dummy equal to one if an entrepreneurial firm is backed by a CVC and the firm does not have a technological fit with any of the CVC parents and zero otherwise. The omitted group is IVC-backed entrepreneurial firms. Thus, the coefficients of these two dummies represent respective CVCs’ effects on innovation output of CVC-backed firms relative to IVC-backed firms. We report pre- and post-IPO innovation output in Columns (1) and (2), respectively. For brevity, we suppress the coefficient estimates of all control variables.  \n\nThe coefficient estimates of $C V C w/$ technologic fit, $\\beta_{1}$ , are significantly higher than those of $C V C w/o$ technologic fit, $\\beta_{2}$ , in both the pre- and post-IPO innovation output regressions. The results suggest that entrepreneurial firms with technological fit with a CVC's corporate parent generate $44.4\\%$ $(62.2\\%)$ more patents than do IVC-backed firm pre-IPO (post-IPO). Although the CVCbacked portfolio firms that do not have a technological fit with CVC corporate parent do not generate higher innovation output than do IVC-backed firms pre-IPO, they do exhibit a $31\\%$ higher innovation output than IVC-backed firms do post-IPO. The differences in magnitudes between $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ are statistically significant, suggesting that entrepreneurial firms backed by CVCs with technological fit are more innovative than are firms backed by CVCs without technological fit.  \n\nWe extend our analysis and examine the effect of technological fit on the innovation output using a DiD analysis within the pairs of propensity score matched IPO firms and report the results in Panel B of Table 10. The panel reports both the pre- and post-IPO innovation output results. In Columns (1)-(3) of Panel B we compare the pre- and post-IPO innovation output of IVC-backed firms to that of CVC-backed firms with a technological fit to a CVC's corporate parent. Columns (4)-(6) conduct a similar analysis between IVC-backed firms and CVC-backed firms without a technological fit. Column (7) reports the DiD estimates. For robustness, we present results based on different matching firm selection criteria. The DiD estimates are generally positive and statistically significant. This result is consistent with our findings reported in Panel A that  \n\nPanel A: Regression analysis  \n\nTable10 Mechanisms through which CvCs nurture innovation: Technological fit   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Pre-IPO Ln(patents) (1)</td><td>Post-IPOLn(patents) (2)</td></tr><tr><td>CVCw/technologicalfitβ1</td><td>0.444***</td><td>0.622***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">CVCw/otechnologicalfitβ2</td><td>(3.34)</td><td>(3.83)</td></tr><tr><td>0.147</td><td>0.310**</td></tr><tr><td>Othercontrolvariables</td><td>(1.50)</td><td>(2.48)</td></tr><tr><td>Yearfixedeffects</td><td>yes yes</td><td>yes yes</td></tr><tr><td>Industryfixedeffects</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>F-statistics (β1=β2)</td><td>4.00**</td><td>2.97*</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>1,834</td><td>1,834</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>0.269</td><td>0.337</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B: DiD analysis within propensity score matched pairs   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Pre-IPO Ln(Patents)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Exact Match</td><td colspan=\"3\">Technological fit</td><td colspan=\"3\">No Technological fit</td><td rowspan=\"2\">DiD</td></tr><tr><td>Treated (1)</td><td>Controls (2)</td><td>Difference (3)</td><td>Treated (4)</td><td>Controls (5)</td><td>Difference (6)</td></tr><tr><td>Unmatched</td><td>1.336</td><td>0.605</td><td>0.730*** (6.93)</td><td>1.124</td><td>0.605</td><td>0.518*** (5.24)</td><td>0.212** (2.03)</td></tr><tr><td>No restriction</td><td>1.336</td><td>1.098</td><td>0.238*** (2.66)</td><td>1.124</td><td>1.014</td><td>0.109 (1.49)</td><td>0.128 (1.57)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td>1.336</td><td>1.069</td><td>0.266***</td><td>1.124</td><td>0.973</td><td>0.151* (1.83)</td><td>0.116 (1.36)</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>1.336</td><td>0.974</td><td>(3.04) 0.362***</td><td>1.124</td><td>0.982</td><td>0.142</td><td>0.220**</td></tr><tr><td>Industry and year</td><td>1.336</td><td>1.082</td><td>(4.26) 0.253*** (2.92)</td><td>1.124</td><td>0.999</td><td>(1.61) 0.125* (1.82)</td><td>(2.26) 0.129* (1.71)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Post-IPO Ln(patents)</td></tr><tr><td>Unmatched</td><td>2.139</td><td>1.094</td><td>1.044*** (6.93)</td><td>1.768</td><td>1.094</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.674*** (5.07)</td></tr><tr><td>No restriction</td><td>2.139</td><td>1.726</td><td>0.413** (2.10)</td><td>1.768</td><td>1.555</td><td colspan=\"2\">0.213** (1.99)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td>2.139</td><td>1.597</td><td>0.542***</td><td>1.768</td><td>1.535</td><td>0.234** (2.13)</td><td>(1.26) 0.309**</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>2.139</td><td>1.565</td><td>(2.85) 0.573***</td><td>1.768</td><td>1.478</td><td>0.291**</td><td>(1.99) 0.283*</td></tr><tr><td>Industry and year</td><td>2.139</td><td>1.615</td><td>(3.00) 0.523*** (2.73)</td><td>1.768</td><td>1.545</td><td>(2.53) 0.224** (2.08)</td><td>(1.79) 0.300* (1.93)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the analysis of the effect of technological fit between entrepreneurial firm and CVC's corporate parent on the pre-IPO and post-IPO innovation output of the entrepreneurial firms.

Motivating and nurturing innovation is a complex and challenging task in most organizations, because the innovation process tends to be long, risky, and unpredictable (Holmstrom 1989). Using a principal-agent setting, Manso (2011) argues that the innovation process requires considerable experimentation on the part of the innovator and thus incurs a greater chance of failure.17 As a result, a significant amount of failure tolerance on the part of VC investors is required to induce the optimal amount of innovation effort on the part of entrepreneurs.  \n\nAs discussed in Section 1, a number of institutional features of CVCs may allow them to be more failure tolerant than IVCs. First, CVC funds have a much longer investment horizon, which may be necessary for nurturing innovation processes that are very long. Second, whereas IVCs pursue purely financial returns, CVCs pursue both financial returns and strategic (non-financial) benefits for their corporate parent companies. Finally, CVC fund managers are compensated through a fixed salary and corporate bonuses, and hence their compensation is not as sensitive to performance as IVC fund managers'. Taken together, these institutional features may allow CVCs to be more failure tolerant thanIvCs.  \n\nWe first examine whether CVCs are indeed more failure tolerant than are IVCs. Following Tian and Wang (2014), we construct the failure tolerance measure by using the CVC (IVC)'s average investment duration (in years) in their eventually failed ventures over the past ten years. This measure captures a VC investor's attitude toward failure by gauging her willingness to continue investing in an underperforming entrepreneurial firm before she “pulls the plug\" (i.e., stops investing).18  \n\nBecause this is a general test for VCs’ attitude towards failure, we examine all VC firms covered by VentureXpert with non-missing values of failure tolerance in our sample period. In Panel A of Table 11, we report the univariate comparisons of failure tolerance between CVCs and IVCs. The mean difference in the failure tolerance measure between these two types of VCs is statistically significant at the $1\\%$ level, suggesting that CVCs on average tend to wait two more months than do IVCs before liquidating their underperforming ventures. We observe a similar pattern when we compare the median values of failure tolerance.  \n\nIn Panel B of Table 11, we examine whether CVCs are more failure tolerant in a multivariate regression framework. The dependent variable is VC failure tolerance, and the main variable of interest is CVC dummy, which equals one  \n\nTable11 Mechanisms through which CvCs nurture innovation: Failure tolerance  \n\nPanel A: Univariate analysis of VC failure tolerance  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Mean</td><td>2.623 2.291</td><td>2.458</td><td>0.165*** 0.077***</td><td>3.24</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Median</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">PanelB:Multivariate analysis ofVCfailure tolerance</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">CVC dummy</td><td>0.292**</td><td>0.337***</td><td>0.369***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Past IPO exit</td><td>(2.43)</td><td>(2.84)</td><td>(3.07)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>-0.099</td><td>-0.329**</td><td>0.047</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Industry expertise</td><td>(0.67)</td><td>(2.23)</td><td>(0.34)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>-1.273***</td><td>-0.261*</td><td>-1.073***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Stage expertise</td><td>(9.90)</td><td>(1.67) 0.485***</td><td>(7.83) 0.288***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>0.476*** (4.25)</td><td>(4.51)</td><td>(2.76)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Ln(VC age)</td><td>0.267***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Ln(past no. of firms)</td><td></td><td>0.365***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Ln(past fundraising)</td><td></td><td>(11.76)</td><td>0.114***</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td>(8.47)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Other control variables</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Year fixed effects</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Industry fixed effects</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Observations</td><td>14,772</td><td>14,904</td><td>15,257</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">R2</td><td>0.19</td><td>0.21</td><td>0.19</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Panel C: Multivariate analysis within propensity score matched pairs</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">No restriction</td><td>Industry</td><td>Year</td><td>Industry and year</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Diff. in pre-IPO Ln(patents)</td><td>0.238***</td><td>0.159***</td><td>0.0754*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td>(2.86)</td><td>(1.82)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Diff.in post-IPO Ln(patents)</td><td>0.514***</td><td>0.450***</td><td>0.122*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td>0.285*** (4.22)</td><td>(6.70)</td><td>(1.91)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table reports the analysis of the effect of VC failure tolerance on the pre-IPO and post-IPO innovation output of the entrepreneurial firms. Panel A reports the univariate analysis of the differences in failure tolerance between CVCs and IVCs. Panel B reports the results of the regression analysis. Panel C reports the analysis in which only the propensity score matched CVC- and IVC-backed firms are included. We adopt the following regression framework:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{L n(I n n o v a t i o n_{C V C})-L n(I n n o v a t i o n_{M a t c h e d~I V C})=\\beta(F a i l u r e~T o l e r a n c e_{C V C}-F a i l u r e~T o l e r a n c e_{I V C})}\\ &{~}\\ &{~+\\delta^{'}C o n t r o l s+\\varepsilon.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWe use the propensity score matching methodology to match each CVC-backed IPO firm with three nearest neighbor IVC-backed IPO firms and report four different sets of results based on types of exact matched enforced. The standard errors inPanel C are clustered at the firm level. $***$ $^{**}$ , and \\* indicate significance at $1\\%$ $5\\%$ , and $10\\%$ levels, respectively.  \n\nfor CVCs and zero for IVCs. Following Tian and Wang (2014), we control for VC's past successful investment experience (Past IPO Exit), VC's expertise in certain industries measured by its industry concentration (Industry Expertise), VC's expertise in certain development stages of venture (Stage Expertise), and proxies for VC's reputation $(L n(V C A g e)$ , Ln(Past No. of Firms), and $L n\\mathbf{(}P a s t$ Fundraising)) in the regressions. The observational unit is VC firm-year in this analysis. The coefficient estimates of CVC dummy are all positive and significant. This finding suggests that CVCs are indeed more failure tolerant than are IvCs.  \n\nWe then link this finding to our innovation output analysis. Similar to our analysis testing the technological fit mechanism, we examine whether the innovation output differences between propensity score matched pairs of CVCand IVC-backed firms can be explained by the difference in failure tolerance of their respective VC investors. Given that the failure tolerance measure is continuous rather than dichotomous as in the case of our technological fit analysis, we implement the analysis by running the following regressions:  \n\n$$\nL n(I n n o\\nu a t i o n_{C V C})-L n(I n n o\\nu a t i o n_{M a t c h e d~I V C})=\n$$  \n\n$$\n=\\beta(F a i l u r e~T o l e r a n c e_{C V C}-F a i l u r e~T o l e r a n c e_{I V C})+\\delta^{\\prime}C o n t r o l s+\\varepsilon,\n$$  \n\nwhere Innovationcvc - InnovationMatched Ivc is the difference in the innovation output between a CVC-backed IPO firm and the average innovation output of the set of IVC-backed IPO firms that are propensity score matched to each CVCbacked firm. Failure Tolerancecvc -Failure Toleranceivc is the difference in failure tolerance between the respective sets of VCs investing in a CVC-backed firm and its matching IVC-backed firms.19 If the difference in failure tolerance between the investors in the CVC- and IVC-backed firms explains the difference in the innovation output of these respective types of firms, then we expect the coefficientestimateof $\\beta$ to be positive and significant. If, however, the tolerance for failure is not a mechanism that contributes to CVCs' greater ability to nurture innovation, then $\\beta$ should be equal to zero.  \n\nSimilar to our baseline regressions, we control for two sets of IPO firm characteristics measured at the IPO year: one set is associated with the CVCbacked firm, and the other set refects the average characteristics of propensity score matched IVC-backed firms. For example, for the three nearest neighbors propensity score matched firms, we average the financial characteristics across these three IVC-backed firms and use the resulting averages as control variables.  \n\nPanel C of Table 11 reports our regression results. For brevity, we only reportthe $\\beta$ coefficient estimates and suppress the control variable coefficients. Regardless of the nearest neighbor restrictions imposed in our propensity score matching procedure, we find that the coefficient estimates of $\\beta$ are positive and significant both pre- and post-IPO. The evidence suggests that the difference in failure tolerance between CVCs and IVCs is able to explain the difference in the innovation output of their entrepreneurial firms.20  \n\nFinally, in an untabulated analysis, we include the VC failure tolerance variable in the OLS baseline regressions within CVC- backed firms and the propensity scored matched IVC-backed firms for the innovation output of firms pre- and post-IPO. This test allows us to check whether CVC financing still has a direct (residual) effect on innovation after controlling for failure tolerance. We find that, whereas the coefficient estimates on VC failure tolerance variable in these regressions are all positive and significant, the coefficient estimates on CVC financing variable are also still positive and significant at the $1\\%$ level. However, the magnitudes of the coefficient estimates on CVC financing variable are reduced quite substantially (for example, the coefficient estimate on CVC Backing Dummy is reduced to 0.171 when pre-IPO patent count is the dependent variable) once we include the VC failure tolerance variable, suggesting that the effect of CVC financing on innovation by entrepreneurial firms is at least partly mediated through failure tolerance.  \n\nTaken together, our results presented in Section 4 suggest that there are two possible underlying economic mechanisms through which CVCs nurture innovation to a greater extent than do IVCs: the technological fit between CVCs parent firms and the entrepreneurial firms backed by them and greater failure tolerancebyCvCs.  \n\n## 5. Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper, we analyze how CVCs differ from IVCs in nurturing innovation in the entrepreneurial firms backed by them. We find that CVC-backed firms achieve a higher degree of innovation output, as measured by their patenting, although these firms are younger, riskier, and less profitable. Although our baseline results are based on entrepreneurial firms that eventually go public, we come to similar conclusions based on our analysis of the entire universe of VCbacked entrepreneurial firms, suggesting that our results are not driven by CVCs bringing their most innovative firms public. Although we cannot rule out the existence of a selection effect, we present a number of empirical tests suggesting that our results are unlikely to be entirely driven by the better selection ability on the part of CVCs. Instead, the results of our propensity score matching and difference-in-differences analyses suggest that there is a significant treatment effect of CVC financing on innovation. Our analysis reveals two possible mechanisms through which CVCs are able to better nurture innovation: the technological fit between CVCs’ parent firms and the entrepreneurial firms backed by them and the greater failure tolerance by CVCs relative to IVCs.  \n\n## References  \n\nAcharya, V., and K.
