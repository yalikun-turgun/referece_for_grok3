Despite the remarkable growth of both China's tech sector and venture capital market, academic research in this area remains sparse. Two broad issues hinder the efforts of researchers studying this market: choosing the right data sources and understanding evolving institutional details. To address these two issues, I first describe available data sources, accompanied with filters aimed at improving the quality of the data. I then review institutional details unique to the Chinese setting and recent regulatory changes that have direct impacts on the Chinese venture capital market. I conclude by listing some openresearchquestions.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nAlthough the Chinese venture capital (VC) market has a relatively short history, various estimates suggest that it has already developed into the second largest VC market in the world, falling only behind the US. Additionally, China hosts the second largest number of startups with valuations over $\\$1$ billion (commonly referred to as “\"unicorns\") (Fig. 1). Despite the rapid growth of China's tech sector and venture capital market, there is still relatively little academic research in these areas.? This dearth could be explained, at least in part, by two broad issues. First, like VC research in general, the Chinese VC market lacks consistent and representative data. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that a clear distinction between venture capital and private equity (PE) is lacking in China. Second, though the Chinese VC market shares the basic structures of its US counterpart, some of its institutional settings are dynamic and quickly evolving. The unique nature of these settings raises barriers for researchers studying this market. In this paper, I discuss these two broad issues related to academic research on the Chinese VC market and contribute to the literature by describing available data sources and reviewing relevant institutional details and recent regulatory changes.  \n\n![](images/25ce66c243cedd35e2eefc8599b7e27a52670f3347d1abef863cdf5f947b30e6.jpg)  \nSource: CB Insights (as of September 30th, 2021)   \nFig. 1. Number of Unicorn Companies. Notes: This figure plots the number of unicorn companies (startups with a valuation over $\\$1$ billion) by country based on a sample collected by CB Insights as of September 30th, 2021.  \n\nFor data sources on Chinese venture capital, I list those that have been used in existing research and briefly compare two of the main sources - CVSource and Zero2IPO. Based on my comparison, I rely on the Zero2IPO database - the largest data source covering Chinese venture capital funds - to create the sample used for analysis later in the paper. By applying two main filters to the set of venture capital funds included in the Zero2IPO database, I arrive at a sample of Chinese VC funds that are more likely to actually practice venture capital investing strategies. The first filter requires that the funds be managed by a VC firm. As PE firms in China also raise and manage venture capital funds, this filter separates funds managed by VC firms from other types of asset management firms (like PE) that often have different investing incentives and experience in running the funds. The second filter is the requirement that the funds be registered with a publicly accessible regulatory website similar to the Edgar website in the Us. This filter ensures that the information reported in the commercial database is accurate and that the funds are venture capital funds as opposed to general equity investment funds as disclosed by fund managers. Application of these two filters allows me to derive a clean sample of Chinese venture capital funds whose information is accurate and can be cross-checked.  \n\nIn my discussion of Chinese venture capital institutions, I focus on institutions that are directly related to raising and managing venture capital funds and making investment decisions in China and institutions whose impacts are also more easily quantifiable. Therefore, this discussion is specific and includes relevant regulatory changes in recent years. Specifically, I structure the discussion around the typical “\"venture capital cycle\": limited partners (LPs) and venture capital funds that together supply the capital, entrepreneurs that demand venture capital, and the exit of VC investments from portfolio companies. In the discussion of the supply of venture capital, I first discuss Chinese government guidance funds. I then focus on the set of more standard and market-driven Chinese venture capital funds. For this set of funds, I describe the current composition of limited partners (LPs) and also discuss recent regulatory changes that could alter this composition in the long run. These changes include relaxations on existing rules that prohibit public institutions from making equity investments. For venture capital funds, my discussion focuses on organization forms and on a legal change in 2007 that made limited partnership available in China for venture capital funds. In the discussion of the demand for venture capital, I explain some of the factors and regulatory changes that may have played an important role in promoting the rise of entrepreneurship in China, particularly high-tech entrepreneurship. Lastly, I describe the current distribution of exit channels for Chinese VCs and document how the launch of recent stock exchanges has further facilitated the IPO channel as the dominant exit route for Chinese venture capital funds.  \n\nWhile this paper focuses on data sources and institutional details for Chinese venture capital research, it does not provide a complete survey of existing academic research on the Chinese VC market, nor does it try to characterize venture capital investments in  \n\nChina.3 For information on the funding of entrepreneurship and innovation in China, Cong et al. 2020) provide a survey of academic findings and discuss the implications for public policy. For characteristics of Chinese venture capital investments, Huang and Tian (2020) provide a recent review.4 There also exists a broader view of institutions that can impact venture capital, including political structure, property rights, culture, and social norms. While this broader institutional view is not within the scope of this paper, Bruton and Ahlstrom (2003) provide relevant discussion of these topics.  \n\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, I describe the available data sources for Chinese venture capital research. In Sections 3 and 4, I focus on the supply and demand side of Chinese venture capital, respectively. In Section 5, I examine the exit channels for Chinese VCs. I conclude in Section 6 by listing some open questions.  \n\n## 2. Data sources  \n\nAs is the case for research on the US VC market (Kaplan and Lerner, 2016), a universal venture capital database for the Chinese VC market does not exist. Table 1 summarizes a list of data sources that have been used in the academic research on the Chinese venture capital market. Within this list, CVSource (or ChinaVenture, https://www.cvsource.com.cn/) and Zero2IPO (or PEdata, http://www. zero2ipo.com.cn/en/) are the two most commonly used databases (see, e.g., Gu and Lu, 2014; Fu et al., 2019; Suchard et al., 2021). A few reasons may explain the wide use of CVSource and Zero2IPO. First, these two databases are the earliest to start tracking Chinese VC investments and, therefore, are likely more comprehensive in covering data from earlier periods relative to newer data sets, such as CNRDS. Zero2IPO, in particular, was founded in 2000, which marks the beginning of the Chinese VC industry. Second, based in China, these two databases are likely better at collecting local VC activity in comparison to databases operating outside of China, e.g. VentureXpert and Pitchbook.5 Third, because CVSource and Zero2IPO are specialized venture capital databases, they likely cover a more representative sample of venture capital investments in comparison to databases that are better known for covering Chinese public firms, such as CSMAR and WIND.° Lastly, as commercial databases, CVSource and Zero2IPO may have a stronger incentive to collect and maintain high quality venture capital data relative to the public disclosure data provided by AMAC and NECIPS where only basic information is available.  \n\nThe existence of multiple datasets, as well as their use without careful comparison and specification of filters for sample selection, risks producing inconsistent and unreliable research results. Therefore, I focus on the two most commonly used databases, CVSource and Zero2IPO, and begin by comparing them. As most of my discussion in this paper is based on a sample of venture capital funds, 1 compare the two datasets based on the set of venture capital funds they cover.  \n\nTo compare the two databases, I first download all venture capital funds that are closed between 2000 and 2020 from each of the databases. Specifically, for CVSource I select the fund type “venture\" in the fund table, and for Zero2IPO I select “venture capital funds.\"' I then merge the two sets of funds based on their full legal name without applying any filters.7 Examining the merged datasets, I find the following: First, the two databases vary significantly in their coverage, with a large fraction of the data non-overlapping. For example,fewerthan $40\\%$ of the funds covered by CVSource appear in Zero2IPO, while fewer than $10\\%$ of thefundscoveredby Zero2IPO appear in CVSource. Second, Zero2IPO covers many more VC funds than CVSource. For example, over the sample period 2000-2020, the former database covers 11,302 funds, while the latter only covers 2474 funds.8 As Zero2IPO provides a much larger sample of venture capital funds than CVSource, I use Zero2IPO as the main source for the analysis in this paper and CVSource as an alternative source to provide robustness checks whenever possible.9  \n\nOne issue present in the Chinese VC data is that a clear boundary between venture capital and private equity is lacking (Huang and Tian, 2020). In fact, both Chinese VC firms and PE firms raise so-called “venture capital funds\" that may be used to invest in startups. Among the venture capital funds that are included in the Zero21PO database, I find that 5276 are raised by VC firms and 5026 are raised by PE firms. As shown in Fig. 2, the fundraising activity of PE firms is much more volatile than that of VC firms, especially in recent years. This wide fluctuation of PE activities indicates that these firms are more subject to market cycles and operate much differently than traditional VCs. In addition, I find that on average a PE firm raises about $30\\%$ fewer venture capital funds than a VC firm and is thus less experienced. Consistent with PE's inexperience in startup investing, I find that PE-managed funds have a lower success rate than VC-managed funds, and the latter produced three times as many successful exits as the former fund type over the period 2000-2020. For these reasons, I exclude venture capital funds that are raised by any non-VC firm from my sample.10  \n\nTable 1 Chinese venture capital data sources.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Most commonlyuseddatabases</td></tr><tr><td>CVSource</td><td>。Link:https://www.cvsource.com.cn/ 。Summary:aleadingcommercialdatabase covering Chineseventure capitalinvestments</td></tr><tr><td>Zero2IPO</td><td>·Link:http://www.zero2ipo.com.cn/en/ 。Summary:themostcomprehensive commercialdatabasecoveringChineseventure capitalinvestments</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Other databases RefinitivEikonformally</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VentureXpert)</td><td>。 Link: https://www.refinitiv.com/en</td></tr><tr><td>Pitchbook</td><td>。Link:https://pitchbook.com/</td></tr><tr><td>CNRDS</td><td>。Summary: a relatively new English data source that covers Chinese venture capital investments 。 Link: https://www.cnrds.com/Home/Login 。Summary:a data source designed forusein academicresearch</td></tr><tr><td>CSMAR</td><td>·Link:https://cn.gtadata.com/ °Summary: a data source that has been known for covering Chinese public firms and started to provide Chinese angel/VC</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>investmentsthataremostlysourcedfromotherexistingdatabases ·Link:https://www.wind.com.cn/</td></tr><tr><td>WIND AMAC</td><td>investments ° Link: https://gs.amac.org.cn/amac-infodisc/res/pof/manager/managerList.html</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>。Summary:a newly available data source covering thebasicinformation of ChineseVCfirms andfunds 。Link: www.gsxt.gov.cn</td></tr><tr><td>NECIPS</td><td>funds and VC firms 。Link: https://www.itjuzi.com/</td></tr><tr><td>ITJUZI</td><td>。Summary: a data source covering Chinese venture capitalinvestments specifically in theIT sectors</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: This table summarizes the list of data sources covering the venture capital investments in China.  \n\n![](images/6b6af810a4ec8a68e5046ac4c4168f85ac35d39e71317322e1a9f292115d4835.jpg)  \nFig. 2. Number of Funds Managed by VC Firms vs. non-VC Firms. Notes: This figure plots the number of venture capital funds in the Zero2IPO database that are managed by VC firms vs. other types of firms (mainly PE firms). The plot is by fund closing year over the 2000-2020 period.  \n\nAnother issue with the Chinese VC data is that venture capital funds were not subject to any public disclosure before 2014. Without such disclosure, the authenticity and accuracy of the information in the VC database is difficult to verify.11 As of 2014, a regulatory change began requiring all domestic VC firms, together with the funds they managed (including both active and liquidated funds), to register with a self-regulatory association of asset management companies (i.e., Asset Management Association of China, or AMAC) on AMAC's publicly accessible website (https://gs.amac.org.cn/amac-infodisc/res/pof/manager/index.html).12 Registration with AMAC is not only required by the law, it is also a prerequisite for VC firms to apply for tax benefits and enjoy other regulatory advantages.13 As shown by Fig. 3, Chinese VC funds have largely been complying with the registration requirement.14 For VC funds that are closed after 2012, the fraction of funds that registered with AMAC is above $60\\%$ and has increased to almost $90\\%$ in more recent years. This required registration with AMAC facilitates data collection and improves the quality of Chinese VC data in several ways. First, it allows data providers to verify their data; extract more accurate information, including the full legal name and social IDs of asset managers and their funds; and link this information to other publicly available data sources, such as business registration data. This will ultimately improve the accuracy and coverage of Chinese VC data. Second, the registration of VC funds with AMAC also requires disclosing the fund type: as either a venture capital fund or a general equity investment fund. Since a qualified venture capital fund must mainly invest in small and young firms that have potential for high growth, this disclosure is useful in clearly separating VC funds from other types based on legal compliance.15 For these reasons, I restrict the sample of VC funds in the Zero2IPO database to those whose registration with AMAC can be verified by the data provider and those that have disclosed themselves as “venture capital funds\" in the registration.  \n\nIn summary, starting with 11,302 venture capital funds in the Zero2IPO database that are closed between 2000 and 2020,16 1 require thesefundstobe  \n\n1.China-based(excluding389funds),   \n2. managed by VC firms (excluding 5637 funds),17 and   \n3. registered with AMAC as “venture capital funds” (excluding 2100 funds)  \n\nAs a result of these requirements, I derive a sample of 3176 Chinese VC funds, which is the main sample for my analysis in this paper.18 Although it is easier to apply the above filters to Chinese venture capital funds based on the Zero2IPO database, it is also feasible to do so using other data sources. For reasons discussed above, these filters will likely produce a cleaner and more reliable sample for Chinese venture capital research.  \n\nDepending on the specifics of the settings, however, caution should be exercised when applying these filters. For example, the filter that excludes funds managed by PE firms from our main sample could underestimate the total market size of startup financing available in China; this filter could also introduce bias for the analysis of late-stage financing deals as PE-managed funds are more likely to invest in late-stage deals compared to VC-managed funds.19 Secondly, the filter that requires AMAC registration of venture capital funds excludes funds from earlier periods and funds managed by foreign VCs from our main sample.2° This exclusion may limit analysis of a broader sample of VCs operating in China over a longer period.  \n\nFinally, Chinese venture capital data can be relatively easily matched to external data sets, including public firms, business registration, and patent data. For example, both CVSource and Zero2IPO provide full legal names of venture capital funds and their portfolio companies. As both VC funds and portfolio companies are required to have a unique full legal entity name to operate (e.g., Fei, 2018), they can be accurately matched to external data sets based on these full legal names.21 Beyond full legal names, VC databases may also provide information on uniform social credit codes for venture capital funds and portfolio companies, which is a mandatory and permanent legal identifier for any business entity operating in China.22 This uniform social credit code can further facilitate the matching of Chinese venture capital data with external data sets.23  \n\n![](images/983268c673869797642fe883e48e0634195155c64d496d72b991189275c532a6.jpg)  \nFig. 3. Fraction of Funds Registered with AMAC. Notes: This figure plots the fraction of funds in the Zero2IPO database that have registered with the Asset Management Association of China (AMAC) for the set of funds managed by VC firms and the set of funds managed by non-VC firms (mainly PE firms), respectively. The plot for non-VCmanaged funds is truncated at 2007 as the number of funds is small before 2007 (lower than 5). The plot is by fund closing year over the 2000-2020 period. The vertical line represents the year 2014, the first year in which the registration became mandatory.  \n\n## 3. The supply of venture capital  \n\nI start my discussion of the institutional details of the Chinese VC market from the supply side of venture capital. Specifically, I first discuss Chinese government guidance funds (GGFs) in Subsection 3.1. I then focus on the set of non-GGF venture capital funds in our main sample, which are more standard and market driven. Specifically, for this set of VC funds, I discuss the composition of limited partners (LPs) in Subsection 3.2 and the organization forms of the venture capital funds in Subsection 3.3.  \n\n### 3.1. Government guidance funds  \n\nA special type of fund that plays an important role in the Chinese VC market is government guidance funds (GGFs). GGFs are policy funds set up by Chinese governments at various levels to provide funding for firms in sectors that central or local governments consider important and under-funded. GGFs also serve the goal of encouraging other sources of capital to further invest in these sectors. Depending on the specific focus, a GGF can be either a government-oriented industry guidance fund or a VC investment guidance fund.24 Similar to non-GGF venture capital funds, a GGF can be organized as a Limited Liability Company (LLC), or a Limited Partnership (LP) (see more discussion in Subsection 3.3 below).  \n\nThe first GGF - the Zhongguancun VC guidance fund - was established in Beijing in 2002. Since then, GGFs in China have seen significant growth (see Fig. 4). Estimates based on the Zero2IPO database suggest that 1631 GGFs with a total target size of 9.0 trillion  \n\n![](images/1116945ff6efcd4f901b43affe04ba74835c819d544319378a646a6efd15d7ce.jpg)  \nFig. 4.Government Guidance Funds. Notes: The upper panel of this figure plots the number of all Chinese government guidance funds (GGFs) and the number of GGFs managed by stateowned firms by year. The lower panel plots the distribution of commitment events by investor type for the set of GGFs whose investors can be identified. Each investor investing in a GGF is counted as one commitment event.  \n\nRMB(about $\\$1.3$ trillion) have been raised over the period of 2002-2020.25 The number of GGFs is particularly significant in comparison to the 3176 funds raised by VC firms in our main sample.26 As noted above, GGFs can be set up either by the central government or by local governments at the provincial, prefectural city, and county levels. Based on the Zero2IPO sample of GGFs, only a tiny fraction of GGFs $(2.21\\%)$ are set up by the central government, and the vast majority are set up by local governments.27 The investment capital for GGFs may be provided solely by governments through public budget or jointly by governments and other sources of capital. Although GGFs encourage commitments from various types of investors, including private investors, the data suggestthatover $80\\%$ of investors are still state-owned. For a set of GGFs whose investor types can be identified (about $60\\%$ ofallGGF investors), we further decompose the investors by type. The lower panel of Fig. 4 shows that the investor distribution of GGFs is dramatically different from that of non-GGF venture capital funds (see Subsection 3.2 below).  \n\nSince GGFs are directly set up by central and local governments, the development of GGFs is heavily impacted by government policies and regulations. Since 2007, a series of GGF regulations have been published by the agencies overseeing GGFs, including the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Together with the Ministry of Science and Technology, the MOF first published a rule in 2007 that specifies the framework for administering Technology-SME-oriented VC investment guidance funds.28 Then in 2015, the MOF released another notification that provides guidelines for the administration of so-called “state-investment funds.\\*29 Further in 2016, the NDRC released its own rule regarding the administration of industry guidance funds with government ownership.30 Although these regulations from various oversight agencies have slightly different policy foci, they all govern the establishment and operation of GGFs in China. Together with some strong policy initiatives around 2015,31 these regulations almost immediately stimulated a surge of GGFs in China (Fig. 4). For example, more than 400 GGFs were established in 2016 alone. The number of newly founded GGFs has fallen since the 2016 peak, but it remains significant at around 100 funds each year.  \n\nWhile a potentially important source of capital for Chinese startups, GFs still have a relatively short history, and their continued development faces a set of obstacles. For example, even though the 2015 and 2016 regulations clearly state that GGFs should be operated on market principles and managed by professional firms, estimates based on the Zero2IpO sample suggest that about $75\\%$ Oof all GGFs are still managed by state-owned firms, which raises questions over whether the best management firms have been selected for GGFs. Furthermore, although the regulations prohibit governments from interfering with the daily operations of GGFs, many local governments still frequently require mandatory funding of certain sectors or companies to promote local economy (Lin, 2021). Finally, GGFs may also suffer from governance issues, e.g., appointing managers instead of selecting those most capable based on their track record. Given these obstacles, along with GGFs departure from standard venture capital funds in practice, I exclude GGFs from the main sample in this paper. The remainder of my discussion focuses on the sample of Chinese VC funds that are more market driven and resemble their international counterparts.  \n\n### 3.2. The composition of limited partners  \n\nFor each VC fund, the Zero2IPO database provides information on the number of LPs of each type. Using the main sample of Chinese VC funds constructed in Section 2, I compute the fraction of capital commitment events from each type of LP to gauge the relative importance of different types of LPs in the Chinese VC market.32 Fig. 5 plots the fraction and shows that the most important LP class in the Chinese VC market is “\"wealthy families and individuals,”’ which represent about $60\\%$ of the market share by number of commitment events. According to Chinese regulations, these LPs must be “qualified investors\" that have net assets of at least 10 million RMB (about $\\$1.6$ million) as institutions or that have financial assets of 3 million RMB (about $\\$0.5$ million) or annual income of 500,000 RMB (about $\\$80,000$ in the last three years as individuals.3 The second most important LP class is \\*VC/PE investment institutions,” which account for about $20\\%$ of the market share. These are unspecified institutional investors that make asset allocations to the VC/PE asset class. The third largest LP class is “enterprises,” which contribute about $10\\%$ of the commitments. These LPs are for-profit companies, either state-owned or privately-owned businesses that make contributions to VC funds. Among the set of VC funds with at least one enterprise LP, I find that for about $11\\%$ of the funds, the enterprise is the only LP. Enterprise LPs of this type are also considered to be corporate VCs (i.e., CVCs) (Ma, 2020), which play an important role in financing startups. The other types of LP classes account for less than $10\\%$ in market share as each single group. 34  \n\n![](images/c86aee0ceeeb1c36bed49f91a683409f21d96ba3f19410090797a6fe2ecfe319.jpg)  \nFig. 5. Fraction of Commitment Events by LP Type. Notes: This figure plots the distribution of commitment events by LP type for the main sample of Chinese venture capital funds in this paper. Each LI investing in a VC fund is counted as one commitment event.  \n\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the composition of LPs in the Chinese VC market is dramatically different from that of the US VC market. For example, while the largest LP class in China - wealthy families and individuals - represents as much as $60\\%$ of the market share, the same group of LPs accounts for less than $1\\%$ in the Us.35 At the same time, important institutional investors, such as public pension funds and university endowments, each contributing about $30\\%$ of the LP market share in the US VC market, are not significant players in China (Lerner et al., 2007). As different types of LP investors have different risk appetite and liquidity demand and are subject to different industry dynamics and economic cycles, differences in the profile of LP investors between the China and US VC markets could have unique implications for the evolution of the Chinese VC market.  \n\nFor quite some time, large and public institutions such as pension funds and banks had not been allowed to invest in the Chinese equity market. However, the experience of other countries suggests that the participation of large and sophisticated institutional investors in a country's equity market can be very valuable. These investors not only have the capacity to supply long-term and large amounts of capital, but they can also stabilize the equity market as they are often less speculative and focused on the long-term value of investments. Additionally, the participation of large institutional investors in the equity market, such as university endowments, can make higher returns for the investors themselves and increase their ability to pay their own obligations. Perhaps having realized the value of large institutional investors' participation in the equity market, in recent years Chinese regulators have started to make policy changes to relax existing restrictions. In particular, a rule was passed in 2015 to allow public pension funds held by local governments to make equity investments of up to $30\\%$ of their net assets (Table 2).36 Due to a set of organizational frictions, the implementation of the 2015 rule is still on-going. In the long run, given the scale of public pension funds,37 the rule change could allow public pension funds to become a significant source of capital for the VC market.  \n\nTable 2 List of regulatory changes.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\">The Supply of Venture Capital</td></tr><tr><td>Limited partners (LPs)</td><td>1.1 In 2014, insurance companies were allowed to invest in venture capital funds following the release of “Guanyu Baoxian Zijin Touzi</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">Venture capital funds</td><td>Guanli Banfa\"by the Chinese State Council.</td></tr><tr><td>1.3 In 2oo7, a new organization form-limited partnership -became available for Chinese venture capitalfunds following the passage of the Partnership Enterprise Law (PEL) in August 2006.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>1.5 In 2014, Chinese VC firms were required to register with the Asset Management of Association of China (AMAC) on a publicly accessible website.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">The Demand forVenture Capital</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">High-tech entrepreneurs</td><td>2.1 In 1999, Chinese universities started their decade-long expansion of college student recruitment.</td></tr><tr><td>2.2 Many local Chinese governments adopted returnee-friendly policies to attract emigrants who have studied and worked overseas to come back to China and start businesses.</td></tr><tr><td>2.3 In 2015,a policy initiative called“Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation\"was launched by the Chinese State Council.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">The VC Exit Channels Thestockexchanges</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3.1In 2009,theShenzhen ChiNextexchangewas established.</td></tr><tr><td>3.2In 2019,theShanghaiStar exchangewaslaunched.</td></tr><tr><td>3.3In2021,BeijingStockExchangewasestablished.</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNotes: This table summarizes some recent regulatory changes relevant to the Chinese venture capital market that have been discussed in the paper.  \n\nA similar regulatory change also occurred in the insurance industry. In December 2014, the China Insurance Regulatory Com. mission issued a notification that allows insurance companies to invest as much as $2\\%$ of their total assets in VC funds.38 The rule was further updated in 2018, which confirmed insurance companies' eligibility for investing in venture capital funds.39  \n\nOverall, there seems to be a trend that more and more public Chinese institutions will be allowed to make equity investments and participate in the venture capital market. This will ultimately change the composition of LPs in this market, potentially reducing the role of individual and family LPs and increasing the significance of institutional LPs. How this change will impact the supply of venture capital and the development of the Chinese VC market remains an open question.  \n\n### 3.3. The organization form of venture capital funds  \n\nSimilar to their US counterparts, Chinese venture capital funds are also organized as limited-life and close-ended funds.40 In this subsection, I focus my discussion on the organization forms of Chinese venture capital funds, as these forms have direct implications for the incentives of LPs and venture capitalists, and on the management and allocation of venture capital.  \n\nBefore a regulatory change in 2006, the only legal structures available for Chinese VC funds were the Limited Liability Company (LLC), Joint Stock Company, and General Partnership. Among these structures, a vast majority of the VC funds used the LLC organizationtype, which accounted for $98\\%$ of the VC funds. The remaining $2\\%$ of VC funds were organized as joint stock companies since the number of investors in the funds may have exceeded the legal limit of 50 for a LLC company.  \n\nIn 2007, following the passage of the Partnership Enterprise Law (PEL),41 a new organization form - limited partnership - became available for Chinese venture capital funds. Similar to its US counterpart, limited partnership in China is a pass-through entity and does not pay tax on its own, and thus does not suffer from the double taxation problem like other Chinese organization entities such as LLCs  \n\n![](images/1dd54741732f20912a56ea6540bc2acccf1dc0c0b854732e80d21f57d04e1ffd.jpg)  \nFig. 6. VC Funds Organized as Limited Partnerships. Notes: This figure plots the number of Chinese venture capital funds in the main sample and the fraction of these funds that are organized as limited partnerships. The plot is by fund closing year over the 2000-2020 period. The vertical line represents the year 2007, the first year in which the limited partnership form became available in China.  \n\nand joint stock companies.42  \n\nI plot the fraction of VC funds that are organized as limited partnerships by fund closing year in Fig. 6. Several patterns emerge from the plot. First, the limited partnership form has already become the most popular organization type for Chinese venture capital funds. For example, after 2011, more than $60\\%$ of the new VC funds closed in each year have been organized as limited partnerships. In more recent years, the fraction of new VC funds organized as limited partnerships has reached almost $100\\%$ .Second, the adoption of the limited partnership form had a slow start before 2011. This slow adoption is at least partly due to a legal obstacle: a limited partnership firm was not allowed to open a security account with any Chinese securities-registration-and-clearing institution (ultimately important for exit if any of the invested portfolio companies goes public) since limited partnership is not considered a “legal person” by Chinese laws. The problem was solved toward the end of 2009 as the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) specifically changed the security account rule for limited partnerships.43 As demonstrated by Fig. 6, the removal of the legal obstacle has had a large impact on the adoption of the limited partnership form by Chinese VC funds.  \n\nUnlike its more recent adoption by venture capital funds in China, limited partnership has long been the dominant form of organizing venture capital funds in the US since the early 1980s (Gompers and Lerner, 1996). Existing literature has argued that the limited partnership form is an optimal organization structure for making venture capital investments because it enables large institutional investors to inject significant sums of capital and to serve as LPs, while also allowing seasoned and specialized asset managers to draw on their experience and expertise in managing the capital as GPs (e.g., Rosenberg, 2002; Kenney, 2000). Consistent with this idea, we indeed observe that limited partnership has long served as the dominant organization form for VC funds in the US and has quickly become the most commonly used form for VC funds in China after it became available. This also suggests that the limited partnership form appears to be an important financial instrument for raising and allocating venture capital across a spectrum of political environments and social norms. Still, micro-level evidence is sparse regarding how the limited partnership form impacts the incentives of LPs and GPs and the investment decisions of venture capitalists. The 2007 legal change in China potentially provides an ideal setting to study this question for two reasons. First, the change is more recent, and second, the LLC form can serve as a more natural and appropriate comparison group for limited partnerships. I leave this open question for future research.  \n\n## 4. The demand for venture capital  \n\nIn this section, I discuss some of the demand side factors that are important for the development of the Chinese venture capital market. It is known that venture capital finances high-tech and high-growth entrepreneurship that typically carries tremendous risk and uncertainty. Therefore, to have a prosperous venture capital market, enough talented and skilled entrepreneurs must be willing to take on this risk and form VC-investable businesses. A few factors in the Chinese system may have played an important role in supplying these entrepreneurs.  \n\nFirst, initiated by the policy of “reform and openness\" in 1978, the Chinese economy has become increasingly liberated and capitalistic. As a result, the huge market has created countless opportunities for brave entrepreneurs. Atracted by these opportunities, the Chinese society as a whole has become highly entrepreneurial. For example, as of July 2021, there are about 146 million active busines entities operating in China. 4 The prosperity of entrepreneurship in the Chinese population naturally creates entrepreneurship that is investablebyVCs.  \n\nA second policy change that may have unintentionally increased the supply of Chinese entrepreneurs is the expansion of university recruitment beginning in 1999.45 The policy change is significant. Before the change, university recruitment grew at about $8.5\\%$ annually. After the change, the growth rate reached almost $50\\%$ in 1999, remaining at relatively high rates for another decade until 2012. At the end of the university recruitment expansion, the gross enrollment rate in China reached about $35\\%$ .The1999 education policy change increased the supply of high-tech entrepreneurs in China for two reasons. First, the change directly increased the number of well-educated individuals who are better prepared to start high-tech entrepreneurship.46 Second, the policy dramatically increased labor market competition for new graduates to take jobs in existing firms and sectors, which facilitated the choice of some students into entrepreneurship upon graduation.47  \n\nA third factor that may have also been important for Chinese high-tech entrepreneurship is the increasing supply of so-called \"returnee” entrepreneurs. These are the entrepreneurs who have studied or worked overseas and eventually come back to start businesses in China. One example is Robin Li, who both studied and worked in the US for many years before he returned to China and co-founded one of the largest Chinese tech giants, Baidu, in 2000. To provide more quantitative evidence, I retrieve top management data of Chinese public firms from the CNRDS database and examine the founders overseas experience.48 I define a founder of a public firm as either the CEO or chairman of the board who held their positions before the firm went public. Focusing on the sample of public firms that had their IPOs between 2000 and 2020, I find that a significant fraction of the founders in the high-tech sectors are returnees. For example, as much as $14\\%$ of all founders in the Biotechnology sector are returnees, and more than $10\\%$ in the IT sector are returnees (Fig. 7). Examining the fraction of returnee founders over time, the lower panel of Fig. 7 suggests that there is also an increasing supply of returnee entrepreneurs in China in more recent years.  \n\nTo attract highly skilled emigrants back to their local regions, many Chinese local governments have also adopted returnee-friendly policies, including tax breaks, subsidized housing, local grants, and awards for returnees.49 Some academic studies suggest that these policies have produced positive impacts on improving local corporate governance and fostering entrepreneurial activity (e.g., Zweig, 2006; Giannetti et al.,2015).  \n\nFinally, entrepreneurship itself may also respond to available financial or economic resources, and therefore, some factors on the financing side beyond those discussed in Section 3 may also play an important role in promoting entrepreneurship in China. For example, Allen et al. (2005) have argued that reputation- and relationship-based informal finance is important for the growth of the private sector in China. Informal finance includes funding from founders' family and friends, private credit agencies, investments from \"ethnic Chinese\" (investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese), and trade credits. These informal financing channels may be particularly important in supporting entrepreneurship when formal financial and legal systems are under-developed as is the case in China (Porta et al., 1998). Another financing side factor that may have also been important for Chinese entrepreneurs is household equity. For example, Wang (2012) shows that following a 1994 reform that allowed state employees to purchase their rental homes at subsidized prices, entrepreneurship increased in Urban China. She also finds evidence that this increase in entrepreneurship is driven by the reduction in labor mobility costs and alleviation of credit constraints following the reform. The household equity channel may have been a particularly important factor in China given that China has the highest home ownership rate in the world (e.g., Huang et al., 2021). Some other financing side factors may have also played an important role for Chinese entrepreneurship. For example, foreign direct investment (FD1) is an important source of capital for Chinese entrepreneurs (e.g., Allen et al., 2005), and China remains the top destination for FDI in the world.5o  \n\n![](images/3b8615267f434b26772e0c63329d411e63be1b8c229a5d627d5f931783f44f57.jpg)  \nFig. 7. Returnee Founders of Chinese Public Firms. Notes: The upper panel of this figure plots the fraction of returnee founders over allfounders of Chinese public firms by industry. The lower panel plots the number of IPOs and the fraction of IPOs with at least one returnee founder by IPO year.  \n\nIn sum, the set of unique factors discussed above may have contributed to entrepreneurship in China, particularly high-tech entrepreneurship. Without systematic studies, the exact impact and relative importance of each factor is still not well understood and warrants future research in these areas. Finally, more recent policy initiatives, such as the Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation  \n\n![](images/6ec642b12c82f4d123f4ccfdfdd0149aa543a26b229b1e7aa52a00527b23acb1.jpg)  \nFig. 8. Chinese VC Exit by Type. Notes: The upper panel of this figure plots the number of Chinese VC-backed companies' exits by different exit types. The lower panel plots the capital value in billions of US dollars that is returned to the Chinese VC funds in these exits by different exit types.  \n\nProgram, may also affect the supply of entrepreneurs in China, the impacts of which could be tested in the future.51  \n\n## 5. The VC exit  \n\nIn this section, I discuss the exit channels for Chinese VCs. Having accessible exit channels is crucial for the healthy development of a venture capital market as VCs need to exit from their portfolio holdings after years of illiquid investments, return the capital to their LPs, and then raise new funds.  \n\nI examine the exit channels based on the main sample of Chinese VC funds retrieved from the Zero2IPO database. Among the portfolio companies invested by these funds, the upper panel of Fig. 8 reports the number of venture-backed companies that have gone through each type of exit. The numbers suggest that there are four types of exit for Chinese VC funds. The IPO channel is the most important, accounting for almost $60\\%$ of the exits. The second most important exit channel is the M&A route, which accounts for $22\\%$ The third channel is secondary sale, accounting for $16\\%$ of the exits. These are sales of equity stakes of the portfolio companies to other institutional or individual investors. The last channel is management buyout, which accounts for less than $4\\%$ of the exits. The lower panel of Fig. 8 reports the total dollar value of each type of exit received by Chinese VC funds. The rank of the four exit channels based on their importance remains unchanged. However, the lower panel also reveals that in terms of capital returned to VC investors, the IPO and M&A channels play a much more important role than the other two exit channels. For example, the IPO and M&A channels returned almost 13 times more capital to VC investors compared to the secondary sale and management buyout channels. This finding is also consistent with the pattern found in other countries that IPOs and M&As are the two main channels of exit for VCs.  \n\nFocusing on IPO and M&A exits, we notice a dramatic difference between the US and China VC market. While IPO has traditionally provided the largest source of revenue for US VCs, M&A has accounted for the vast majority of venture-backed exits by number in recent years. For example, although the US had a strong IPO environment in 2018, the share of all venture-backed exits via IPO versus M&A is only $11\\%$ in the Us.52 In contrast, as demonstrated by Fig. 8, IPO is a much more important exit channel for Chinese VCs, providing almost 3 times as many exits as M&A and returning almost 4 times as much capital as M&A. The difference between the US and China VC markets in IPO versus M&A exit channels reflects some differences in the environment and frictions in the two markets conducting each type of exit. For example, conducting an M&A transaction in China typically requires regulatory approval, which could increase the uncertainty of the deal. In addition, debt financing for M&As in China is also restricted.53  \n\nBecause the IPO exit channel serves as the most important exit channel for Chinese VC funds, I examine it in more detail. The upper panel of Fig. 9 plots the number of venture-backed IPOs by stock exchange. Several patterns emerge. First, the vast majority of IPO exits for Chinese VC funds went through the domestic stock exchanges. For example, the number of IPOs that went through the four domestic stock exchanges (Shenzhen ChiNext, Shanghai Main, Shanghai Star, and Shenzhen Main) is 15 times as many as those that went through overseas stock exchanges. This difference is in contrast to foreign VCs that operate in China, which typically rely on overseas IPOs much more heavily (Huang and Tian, 2020). Second, among the domestic stock exchanges providing IPO exits, the two newer stock exchanges (Shenzhen ChiNext and Shanghai Star) specifically established to improve IPO exit for high-tech companies are more important exit channels for Chinese venture-backed companies than the two traditional stock exchanges (Shenzhen Main and Shanghai Main).54 For example,the former two stock exchanges contributed about $55\\%$ of all domestic VCs IPO exits, while the latter two only contributed about $39\\%$  \n\nThe main boards of the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges (Shenzhen Main and Shanghai Main) were established in 1990 as the first two stock exchanges in mainland China. While they still serve as important exit channels for Chinese VC-backed companies, they also place more stringent requirements on the companies going public in terms of firm assets, profitability, and other conditions. As it often takes longer for high-tech companies to generate profits, especially those backed by VCs, the more stringent requirements makes getting listed on the two traditional Chinese stock exchanges more difficult for VC-backed companies. To solve these problems, the Chinese government has launched a number of new stock exchanges over the years.  \n\nShenzhen ChiNext was established in 2009, and since its launch, it has become the most important exit channel for domestic VCbacked companies. For example, Shenzhen ChiNext alone has contributed approximately $35\\%$ of all domestic VCs IPO exits. A recent study by Bernstein et al. (2020) also finds that the ChiNext stock exchange has been a successful experiment on improving entrepreneurial firms access to the public capital market. Touted as China's equivalent to the US Nasdaq, another new board - Shanghai Star - was established in 2019 with the objective of giving Chinese science and technology companies greater access to capital markets.5 As shown by the lower panel of Fig. 9, the Shanghai Star almost immediately became the most important IPO channel for Chinese VCbacked companies after its launch.  \n\nOverall, Fig. 9 shows that while Chinese VCs rely on domestic stock exchanges for IPO exits, they also rely more heavily on the newer stock exchanges that have lower listing criteria. This suggests that domestic VC-backed companies were constrained in the IPO exit channel before the newer stock exchanges were established. This is somewhat unsurprising given that the traditional Chinese stock exchanges have stringent requirements and the approval-based system often makes the go-public process lengthy and highly uncertain. As the newer stock exchanges were introduced over the years, the constraints in the IPO exit channels for domestic VC-backed companies have been gradually relieved. To further improve capital market access for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  \n\n![](images/c86395e65389aca630ce32058a1843d1c02044e5667fa1c66494072101545298.jpg)  \nFig. 9. IPO by Stock Exchange. Notes: The upper panel of this figure plots the number of IPOs backed by Chinese VC funds by stock exchange for the main sample of Chinese VC funds. The lower panel plots the number of IPOs by IPO year for IPOs on different stock exchanges. The vertical lines represent 2009 and 2019, the years in which Shenzhen ChiNext and Shanghai Star boards were launched, respectively.  \n\nin China, the Chinese government launched another new stock exchange in Beijing in 2021.56 As the IPO exit channel has become more accessible for Chinese VC-backed companies, it is likely that the IPO exit channel will continue to serve as the dominant route for Chinese VCs exiting their investments.57 Indeed, as shown by Fig. 10, the dominance of the  \n\nJ. Chen  \n\n![](images/69c0c9f49bcaa2e577a3039d4d70ddf79909baae26dd50d8d69a7ed4771db21b.jpg)  \nFig. 10. The Importance of IPOs as the Main Exit. Notes: This figure plots the number of IPOs and M&As backed by the Chinese VC funds in the main sample by exit year.  \n\nIPO channel over M&A has become even more prominent in recent years, especially after the launch of the Shanghai Star board. The improvement of the IPO exit for Chinese VCs will also likely impact how they raise and manage funds and make investments. Though the overall impact of this improvement on the development of the Chinese VC market is expected to be positive, micro-level evidence remains scant thus far. Future research could rely on the launch of the new stock exchanges, such as Shenzhen ChiNext and Shanghai Star, for exogenous variation and provide more insight into these areas.58  \n\n## 6. Concluding discussions  \n\nIn this paper, I have chosen to discuss the institutional details of the Chinese venture capital market that are more recent and easily quantifiable and that impact the Chinese VC market more directly, either from the supply or demand side of venture capital or through exit channels. Given this choice, I have left out other potentially important regulations for Chinese VCs, e.g., the Torch program in the 1980s,59 the Innofund in the 1990s, and the split-share structure reform in 2005. Due to a lack of data, this paper also skipped the discussion of venture capital contracts in the Chinese setting.6o  \n\nAs evidenced from the discussions in this paper, the development of the Chinese VC market is heavily influenced by the Chinese government, either through regulations like those discussed in the paper or through direct actions such as running government guidance funds competing with VCs or contributing capital to VC funds as LPs.61 Additionally, taxation is also often used as an important policy tool. For example, the Chinese government made tax policy changes in 2017 and 2018 that allow VC investors to deduct $70\\%$ of the invested capital from their taxable income earned from their investments.62 Moving forward, the Chinese government at various levels will likely continue to play an important role in the development of the Chinese VC market and keep shaping its direction.  \n\nIn summary, I have both described the datasets available for research on the Chinese VC market and discussed institutional details relevant to the market. The quality of the datasets will likely continue to improve and become more reliable over time as public disclosure by Chinese VC funds increases. In terms of institutional details, it is evident that the Chinese VC market provides fertile ground for researchers to test various economic theories and empirical predictions. It should be also clear that more research is warranted on the Chinese VC market as it has grown to be the second largest in the world. The materials in this paper may serve as a first step toward these future efforts. I conclude by listing a handful of open research questions motivated by my discussion:  \n\n· What is the impact of the limited partnership organization form on the fundraising, managing, and investing of venture capital funds? · What are the key determinants of Chinese entrepreneurship, especially high-tech entrepreneurship? · How does the improvement of the IPO exit channel impact venture capitalists' fundraising and investments? Specifically, what are the impacts of the launch of the Shenzhen ChiNext board in 2009 and the Shanghai Star board in 2019?  \n\n## References  \n\nAhlstrom, D., Bruton, G.D., Yeh, K.S., 2007.

To address this important gap, we have devised a machine-human hybrid approach to perform the classification task forVC types. Specifically, we have compiled a list of 49,187 VCs that made investments in China before 2021 from CVSource database, collected VC ownership information from other public sources, developed machine-learning algorithms to predict VC types, and used human coders when machine-learning failed to produce a prediction. Utilizing this hybrid approach, we have classified VCs into one of the following types: GVC (public agency-affliated, stateowned enterprise-affliated), CVC (corporate VC), IVC (independent VC), BVC (bank-affliated VC), FVC (financial/non-bank-affliated VC), UvC (university-affliated VC), and PenVC (pension-fund-affliated VC). We not only provide the most up-to-date database for VC types in the Chinese setting but also demonstrate how to leverage machine-learning algorithms to devise a transparent coding approach for VC-typeclassifications.  \n\n## Background & Summary  \n\nScholars have increasingly emphasized the importance of differentiating among various types of venture capitalists (VCs) such as independent VCs, corporate VCs, and governmental VCs, each with unique interests in the selection, investment, and fostering of ventures. For example, unlike independent VCs (IVCs) that focus on financial returns on investments, corporate VCs (CVCs) are mainly set up to capture technology windows or harness industry growth, thus prioritizing the strategic alignment between their parent firms and their investee ventures'. Governmental VCs (GVCs), demonstrating remarkable growth over the past two decades, are deemed an important policy tool for bridging the equity gap and supporting high-risk start-ups that would otherwise struggle to attract private capital2. Additionally, VCs might also have affiliations with other entities such as banks, financial institutions, universities, or pension funds, each with divergent objectives. Due to this heterogeneity in ownership, different VCs offer distinct value-added services, resources, and network access to their investee ventures and influence the ventures towards different exit channels3. It is thus of great importance to develop and continually update datasets that can facilitate research in this area, enhancing our understanding of the nuanced roles of various VCs in nurturing entrepreneurship and innovation.  \n\nDespite the global proliferation of research on VC types4, there is an extreme dearth of such research in the context of China, the world's second-largest VC market, partly because of the scarcity of high-quality datasets differentiating among types of VCs. For example, as Dushnitsky and Yu (2022, p.1, p.4) argued, “most of what we know about CVC investors ... is based on data from the so-called developed world, and especially the United States and Western Europe” while “the Chinese setting can offer insights into different evolutionary paths\" of CVC activities'. While the leading databases in China (e.g., CVSource, PEdata, and ITJuzi) have provided tags to annotate a few types of VCs (e.g., GVC, CVC), the tags are either incomplete or not up to the standard of research rigor. In an effort to mitigate this data limitation, Dushnitsky and $\\mathrm{Y\\bar{u}^{1}}$ have compiled a large dataset of CVCs in China by integrating multiple data sources; however, this proprietary dataset is not publicly accessible'. Similarly, prior studies on GVCs in China have manually collected and consolidated data regarding VCs? government ownership, but these datasets are typically reserved for private usage5,6. The first and sole study to have publicly disclosed data on VC types in China’s context is Chen et al.7. They manually developed a dataset categorizing 6,553 VCs according to their affiliations and made it freely available. However, this dataset only encompasses VCs active in China's market between 2000 and 2016, rendering it inadequate for analyzing the dramatic changes in VC activities in recent years. For instance, the influx of new VCs into China's market continued after 2016, resulting in a population of over 49,000 VCs as of 2021. Consequently, there remains a conspicuous absence of up-to-date, high-quality datasets delineating the types of VCs that have invested in China's market.  \n\nMore importantly, previous research on China's datasets has leaned heavily on manual coding, a laborious and time-consuming method1,5,6. They use public sources (e.g., WIND, China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{VCs}}$ websites) to discern the ownership of each VC. Such a manual approach suffers from low levels of transparency and is not able to conduct data/results triangulation. As Dushnitsky and Yu (2022, p.18) commented, “We point to an important issue associated with data availability in the Chinese setting. We find that CVC patterns based on data from one database are often not replicated when testing a similar specification using a different database? In other words, it is difficult to triangulate VC-type data from manually coded databases because of the inconsistency of their classification standards and low transparency.  \n\nMachine-learning-based technologies allow the development of a more reliable, consistent, and transparent dataset. Recent advancements in machine-learning algorithms have showcased their superior capabilities in performing classification tasks8. Developing a customized algorithm for VC-type classification and making it open to the public would largely help researchers increase the effciency of data processing and the reliability of the findings. This is particularly pertinent given the exponential growth of VC numbers from thousands to tens of thousands in recent years, rendering manual coding nearly infeasible for completing the necessary tasks.  \n\nUsing a hybrid approach that combines machine-learning-based and manual coding techniques, we have developed a comprehensive dataset, termed ChinaVCtype, that classifies VC types based on their affliations as of 2021. Specifically, we assembled a list of VCs that had invested in China before the end of 2021, sourced from the CVSource database, a leading database on VC investment in China?. We then obtained their ownership details, such as shareholders, shareholder equity, and shareholder business scope, from public sources like Qichacha, a leading database on business administration information in China. In alignment with previous studies\", we designed a multi-step process to categorize each VC into one of the following types: GVC which includes VCs affiliated with public agencies or state-owned enterprises, CVC, independent VC (IVC), bank-affiliated VC (BVC), financial/non-bank-affiliated VC (FVC), university-affliated VC (UVC), and pension-fund-affliated VC (Pen VC). The majority of this classification task is undertaken by machine-learning algorithm. If the algorithm can generate predictions, human coders are invited to double-check its coding quality. Whenever the algorithm is indecisive in predictions, we resort to human coders. A series of validation tests have been conducted by comparing the results of this newly developed dataset with prior studies, affirming its high quality.  \n\nThis study makes three important contributions. First, the dataset we have developed can foster a wide range of topics concerning VC types and entrepreneurship in the context of China. This includes concentrating on a specific VC type (e.g., GVC, CVC), comparing different VC types (e.g., GVC vs. CVC vs. IVC), and assessing the generalizability of VC analyses from developed countries to the Chinese setting. Second and more importantly, going beyond prior studies that struggle to triangulate VC-type data from multiple Chinese VC databases due to low transparency and low consistency of those databases? classification criteria, we have devised a machine-human hybrid approach that makes the VC-type classification process open, transparent, and consistent. By doing so, our study offers a unified VC-type data platform for future research to replicate, compare, and extend prior findings. Third, leveraging the machine-human hybrid approach, we not only provide a methodological foundation for future scholars to apply the data from various platforms on a large scale but also underscore the potential of machine-learning algorithms to assist scholars in performing extensive classification tasks.  \n\n### Methods  \n\nFollowing prior literature, we develop our ChinaVCtype dataset by classifying VCs to seven types, including GVC (public agency-afiliated or SOE-affliated VC), CVC, IVC, BVC, FVC, UVC, and $P e n V C^{4,7}$ Weadopted prior studies' coding schemes whenever possible and made adaptation when necessary. We have developed machine learning algorithms to make predictions and invited human coders to conduct the classification tasks when machine learning algorithms failed to generate a prediction for a VC's type. The whole coding process is to be elaborated in the section“Data coding scheme?\"  \n\nData collection. _  To generate a list of VCs, we started with the population of VCs that have invested in China's market as of 2021. In this study, we have adopted a broad definition of VC, referring to entities that make risky equity investments in entrepreneurial ventures. Consequently, the scope of VC in our study encompasses not only the narrowly defined VC but also private equity (PE), and even corporations that directly invest venture capital in ventures. This is because “a clear distinction between venture capital and private equity (PE) is lacking in China\"9, and we have observed that many corporations may not yet have established their CVC entities to serve as an extension for their corporate venturing activities. Following this broad definition, in the CVSource database, there were 49,187 VCs that have made investments in China as of 2021, and the first deal appeared to be in 1978. Thus, we develop VC types for these 49,187 VCs in China’s market between 1978 and 2021.  \n\nVCs basic information (e.g., VC name, age, location) was collected from CVSource. Information on VCs first-level shareholders (e.g., shareholder name, equity ratio) was collated from Qichacha's professional version (pro.qc.com). For those VCs that were not captured by Qichacha, we checked other public sources (e.g.,. Tianyancha, Bloomberg, Crunchbase, VC official websites, press releases, media reports) to gather information. If any inconsistency across sources was detected, we followed Bertoni and Marti10 to triangulate between multiple sources.  \n\n![](images/77fe832e0606e8cbfbf999f189484338dcd07d3a2011ea9c663a05ad7eb6c4d3.jpg)  \nFig. 1 Coding process. This figure shows the coding process to determine VC types.  \n\nData coding scheme. Figure 1 elucidates the coding process utilized to categorize various types of VCs. This process is bifurcated into two sections. Part I pertains to VCs possessing shareholder information such as first-level shareholder names and their respective equity in VCs. For these VCs, we formulated a method called \"shareholder-based judgement?\" This method initially employs machine learning or human coders to classify each shareholder's type. Subsequently, the shareholder's type and equity data are used to categorize the VC's type. Part II addresses VCs that lack shareholder information. For these VCs, we employed a method referred to as “direct judgement?\" In this approach, machine learning or human coders are used to directly determine the specific category to which a VC belongs.  \n\nPart I. Shareholder-based judgement. Based on the VC list from CVSource, we consolidated their full names and searched in Qichacha for their shareholder names, which resulted in 119,760 unique shareholders for 36,860 VCs. We collcted the basic information of shareholders (e.g., business scope, equity ratio) and developed a four-step (Steps 1.1-1.4) approach to determine VC types, as described below.  \n\nStep 1.1 Consolidate shareholder information from Qichacha.We gathered basic information of VCs' shareholders from Qichacha, including shareholder names, registered capital, ranges of the number of employees, business categories, locations, business scope, introduction, and industries. This data included numerical, ordinal, discrete, and textual data, requiring different pre-processing techniques. We need to pre-process these various types of data to be recognized by machines.  \n\nFirst, regarding numerical data (e.g., registered capital), we transformed them into ordinal data by using the tenth quantile as the range of classification.  \n\nSecond, as for ordinal and discrete data (e.g., ranges of the number of employees, business categories, locations, industries, registered capital transformed), we used one-hot encoding to transform them to be in the dummy formatl1.  \n\nThird, considering the nature of Chinese context, we conducted multiple steps to pre-process textual data: We began with removing special symbols and unnecessary words (such as punctuation and messy code) and keeping Chinese characters, English characters, and numbers only. Next, we adopted the enterprise information dictionary and finance dictionary from Jieba (https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba), which is the most advanced word segmentation tool for Chinese, to segment words in each sentence, and applied stopwords lists from Harbin Institute of Technology to remove unimportant words or connectives12. After that, each shareholder's name, business scope, and introduction were processed by TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), a well-known weighting technique in information retrieval and text mining that can effectively measure the similarity between sentencesl3. Following the application of TF-IDF, each sentence was transformed into a vector. However, the high dimension of each vector poses a challenge for subsequent machine learning. To address this issue, we applied the low variance filtering method, which helps delete low-variance variables that have little influence on machine learning's prediction target. This method allows us to minimize the number of dimensions of the vectors and focus on key differences between each sentence. After data pre-processing, we obtained the representation of textual data.  \n\nTable 1. F1-scores of six models predicting shareholder type based on the results of test dataset. It reports the F1-scores of six models that are used to predict shareholder types in the test dataset. Note: Each type's prediction is independent of other types'; in other words, a shareholder may be labelled positive for two or more types.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Typetopredict</td><td colspan=\"6\">PredictionModels</td></tr><tr><td>Decision tree</td><td>RandomForest</td><td>SVM</td><td>KNN</td><td>MLPClassifier</td><td>Xgboost</td></tr><tr><td>1 (Public agency)</td><td>0.87</td><td>0.90</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.88</td><td>0.71</td><td>0.97</td></tr><tr><td>2 (Corporate)</td><td>0.85</td><td>0.91</td><td>0.62</td><td>0.67</td><td>0.72</td><td>0.91</td></tr><tr><td>3 (Bank)</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.00</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>4 (Financial)</td><td>0.48</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.03</td><td>0.18</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.61</td></tr><tr><td>5 (University)</td><td>0.91</td><td>0.67</td><td>0.40</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.00</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>6 (Professional)</td><td>0.82</td><td>0.87</td><td>0.64</td><td>0.73</td><td>0.63</td><td>0.88</td></tr><tr><td>7 (SOE)</td><td>0.56</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.57</td><td>0.55</td><td>0.60</td><td>0.75</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nStep 1.2 Use supervised machine learning to predict shareholder types. According to previous studies, there are eight mutually exclusive types of shareholders: \\*public agency, corporate, bank, financial, university, professional, person, and pension?\"7 Machine learning is applied to differentiating among the first six types because they have plenty of textual information for algorithms to learn, while for person and pension we mainly applied human coders because it is faster to filter individual names by human coders and because China has very few pensionfunds.  \n\nIn addition, for a shareholder categorized as corporate, bank, financial, or professional types, it may have another level of label denoting whether it is state-owned enterprise (SOE)7. We also used machine learning to learn this feature and make prediction on the SOE label.  \n\nStep 1.2.1 Sample split.  The type of machine learning employed in this study is supervised machine learning. in which the algorithm first learns from a pre-labelled training dataset, predicts the labels of a test dataset, and is only applied to new data prediction if the prediction performance on the test dataset is deemed acceptable. In this sense, the training dataset is for a machine learning model to train its parameters, and the test dataset is to test the generalization ability of the model.  \n\nTo train the machine learning model, a sample with correctly labelled shareholder type (e.g. public agency, corporate, bank, fnancial, university, professonal, SOE) and feature information (e.g., shareholder names, registered capital, ranges of the number of employees, locations, business scope, introduction, and industries) is needed. For this purpose, we resorted to Chen et al's VCAC dataset7. They provided us the manually coded types of VCs' shareholders between 2000 and 2016, but they did not have shareholders feature information. To obtain the features for prediction, we searched in Qichacha using these shareholders names and obtained 6,404 unique shareholders with complete information. We divided these 6,404 shareholders into a training dataset and a test datasetas $80\\%$ (5,123 shareholders) and $20\\%$ (1,281 shareholders).  \n\nStep 1.2.2 Model training.  In total, we adopted six classical prediction models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, MLPClassifier, and Xgboost for prediction, using Python software. The metrics of prediction performance include precision, recall, and F1-score. Among the metrics, precision represents the percentage of how many positive cases predicted-to-be are with truly positive labels in the test datasetl4. In contrast, recall reflects how many truly positive cases have been recognized by the model as positive in the test datasetl4. F1-score synthesizes these two metrics and reflects the comprehensive performance of model prediction15. Thus, we used F1-score to illustrate the comparison of prediction performance. As shown in Table 1, Xgboost demonstrated superior predictive performance, with the highest accuracy consistently across all types. Thus, Xgboost model was used to predict shareholder types.  \n\nThe F1-score analysis of Xgboost reveals that Type 4 (Financial) records the lowest score, suggesting a low accuracy in predicting this type. A detailed manual investigation was carried out, revealing that the inadequate prediction performance is due to the resemblance in the text of Type 2 (Corporate), Type 4 (Financial), and Type 6 (Professional). As an illustration, suppose a shareholder's business scope contains “investment and engagement in industrial projects (投资兴办实业)” Because it mentions industrial projects, the shareholder should be categorized as Type 2 (Corporate). However, the term “investment\" in the business scope may lead to the misclassification of the shareholder as Type 4 (Financial) or Type 6 (Professional). Another example would be, in the introduction of Type 6 (Professional) shareholders, terms such as “venture capitalist (风险投资)” and “business consulting (管理答询)” are frequently used, which also appear in the introduction of Type 4 (Financial) frms. To enhance the accuracy of the model's predictions, it is imperative to implement additional rules to differentiate between Type 2 (Corporate), Type 4 (Financial), and Type 6 (Professional).  \n\nStep 1.2.3 Keyword-based prediction. To tackle the issues mentioned earlier, we manually screened the cases with low prediction power and implemented additional heuristics specifically designed for Type 2 (Corporate), Type 4 (Financial), and Type 6 (Professional) prediction, as shown in Table 2.  \n\nTable 2. Additional heuristics for shareholder type prediction. It shows the heuristics developed by human coders to finetune shareholder type prediction after machine learning.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Descriptionsofheuristics</td></tr><tr><td>-Predict a shareholder as Type 4(Financial)if any of the following keywords appears inFirmName: securities,insurance,trust,financial services,mergersandacquisitions,guarantees(证券，保险，信托，金融服务，并购，担保).</td></tr><tr><td>-Predict a shareholder as Type 4 (Financial) if any of the following keywords appears in Business Scope: non-performing assets,resource development(不良资产，资源开发). -Predict a shareholder as Type 4(Financial) if any of the following keywords appears in Industry:life insurance,insurance agent services,</td></tr><tr><td>insurancebrokerageservices,trust companies,credit services,publiclyoffered securities investmentfunds,notaryservices,otherfutures marketservices,reinsurance,commercialbankingservices,securities market management services,securities andfuturesregulatory services, 公司，信用服务，公开募集证券投资基金，公证服务，其他期货市场服务，再保险，商业银行服务，证券市场管理服务，证券期货监管服 务，证券经纪交易服务，财产保险，财务公司服务）.</td></tr><tr><td>-For a shareholder that is predicted as both Type 2 (Corporate) and Type 4 (Financial), we label it as Type 4 (Financial) if any of the following keywords appears inFirmName:investment,assets,futures,capital,finance,financialleasing（投资，资产，期货，资本，金融，融 资租赁).</td></tr><tr><td>-For a shareholder that is predicted as both Type 4 (Financial) and Type 6 (Professional), we labelit as Type 6 (Professional) if any of the following keywords appears inFirmName:venture capital, investment,consulting,asset management,incubation,innovation（投，投资， 咨询，资产管理，孵化，创新).</td></tr><tr><td>-For a shareholder that is predicted as both Type 2 (Corporate) and Type 6 (Professional), we label it as Type 6 (Professional) if any of the followingkeywords appearsinBusinessScope:business consulting(管理咨询）.</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable 3. Cross-labels on shareholder-type classification by machine learning algorithms. It reports the number of cross-labelled shareholders by machine learning till step 1.2.3. Note: Shareholders classified as corporate, bank, financial, or professional types can also bear the label of SOE. In other words, the cross-labels between SOE and any of these four types are not problematic and thus reported as $\\mathrm{^{\\infty}N.A}$ \" in thistable.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>2 (Corporate)</td><td>3 (Bank)</td><td>4(Financial)</td><td>5(University)</td><td>6(Professional)</td><td>7 (SOE)</td></tr><tr><td>1 (Public agency)</td><td>28</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2(Corporate)</td><td></td><td>5</td><td>65</td><td>0</td><td>340</td><td>N.A.</td></tr><tr><td>3 (Bank)</td><td></td><td></td><td>19</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N.A.</td></tr><tr><td>4 (Financial)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>152</td><td>N.A.</td></tr><tr><td>5(University)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>6(Professional)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>N.A.</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nAfter incorporating the additional heuristics, the F1-score for Type 4 (Financial) increased to 0.65, signifying a noteworthy enhancement. However, this increase in F1-score is not suffcient, highlighting the need for additional human involvement in addressing the remaining cross-labelling issues.  \n\nStep 1.2.4 Screening cross-labels.  The application of machine learning algorithms for shareholder type prediction resulted in multiple labels for a shareholder. A further analysis revealed 613 cross-labelled cases between categories, as shown in Table 3. For instance, 28 shareholders were predicted to be both an “Type 1 (Public agency)\" and “Type 2 (Corporate),” and 340 were predicted to be both “Type 2 (Corporate)\" and “Type 6 (Professional).\"  \n\nTo address this issue, the first three authors conducted a re-screening and double-checking process for the cross-labelled cases. We utilized public sources of shareholder information, including shareholder names, offcial websites, press releases, media reports, and IPO prospectuses, to make the judgements. For instance, if a shareholder was predicted to be both \\*Type 1 (Public agency)” and “Type 2 (Corporate)\" but had “Guidance Funds\" in its name, human coders reclassified it as “Type 1 (Public agency)\" To maintain the quality of the screening and checking process, three authors worked together on all 609 cases. In cases of disagreements, the fourth author was consulted to provide an independent perspective, and the team engaged in thorough discussions to achieve consensus.  \n\nStep 1.3 Invite human coders to code shareholder type.On several occasions, machine learning did not yield the anticipated results for shareholders. First, there were 602 shareholders for whom machine learning could not generate any predictions despite possessing information on the business scope. This is, in part, due to the brevity of their business scope descriptions. In this case, two human coders were brought in to perform the coding task, adhering to the human coding procedure outlined by Chen et al.7. The two coders independently classified the types of the 602 shareholders, and Cohen's Kappa statistic for their results was 0.9821, indicating a very high inter-rater reliability. In instances of disagreement between the two coders, an author, serving as the third coder, was brought in to discuss and resolve the discrepancies.  \n\nAdditionally, 2,681 shareholders? information regarding business scope was completely absent. Again, we invited two human coders to independently work on the coding task, following Chen et al's procedure?. Cohen's Kappa statistic was 0.9838, indicating a very high inter-rater reliability. An author acted as the third coder to intervene to reconcile any differences in the classifications provided by the two coders.  \n\nTable 4. Coding scheme of shareholder types by human coders.

Consistent with Chen et al:s7 “coding on shareholder type\", a two-step approach for shareholder-type coding was conducted.  \n\nFirst, for each shareholder, we utilized its business scope information collected from Qichacha—and if this information was missing, we used information available from public sources-to categorize it into one of the eight mutually exclusive types: public agency, professional, corporate, bank, fnancial, university, person, and pension. The coding scheme is shown in Table 4.  \n\nSecond, for shareholders categorized as corporate, bank, financial, or professional types, we also assessed whether it is SOE. Specifically, we adhered to the procedure outlined by Chen et al.7 for “coding the SOE nature of shareholders.?7 We based our judgement of the SOE classification on two established documents they adopted, namely, “Measures for the Supervision and Administration of the Transactions of State-owned Assets of Enterprises (Order No. 32)” and “Measures for the Supervision and Administration of State-owned Equity of Listed Companies (Order No. 36):\"  \n\nStep 1.4 Use shareholders' type and equity ratio to code VC type. With the predicted/coded results on sharehoider type and the collected information about share ratio, we proceeded with VC-level type classification. Following prior literature', we created two modes of coding, namely, \"non-exclusive VC type coding” and \"'mutually exclusive VC type coding? This step was done by manual coding via Stata software.  \n\nNon-exclusive VC type coding is to account for research needs drawing from theories that concern the diversity of shareholders (e.g., resource-based view, agency theory, institutional logics theory). For example, a VC can tap into a variety of resources if it has multiple types of shareholders or may face different pressures from different types of shareholders, such as a public agency, corporate, and bank. Consequently, a VC can be associated with multiple affiliations that together shape its investment strategies. The coding scheme for non-exclusive VC type coding is adopted from prior literature, as shown in Table 5.  \n\nMutually exclusive VC type coding is to accommodate research needs that concern the heterogeneity at VC level, such as the diversity of VCs in a syndicate. In this case, it would be better if a VC is affliated with a unique type, and every type is mutually exclusive. For this aim, we created a mutually exclusive coding scheme of VC type following prior literature7. The coding follows a sequential process, as shown in Table 6.  \n\nPart I1. Direct judgement.  After we found shareholder information for 36,860 VCs and classified their types based on shareholder information in Part I, we were left with 12,729 VCs that had no shareholder information on Qichacha. They could be individuals, VCs registered out of Mainland China, or VCs that had deregistered, thus lack of record in Qichacha. For VCs with missing shareholder information, we collected their own information from CVSource and developed a three-step (Steps 2.1-2.3) approach to determine their types, as described below.  \n\nTable 6. Coding scheme of mutually exclusive VC type for VCs with shareholder information available. Adopted from Chen et al.?.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Mutually exclusive VC type</td><td>Coding scheme</td></tr><tr><td>GVC</td><td>Meet two criteria:(1)has a shareholder that is labelled as public agency or SOE, and (2)the total equity shares owned by public agency andSOE shareholders aregreater than that of any other type of shareholders(or thetotal number of public agency and SOE shareholdersis greater than that of any other type of shareholders if the equity ratio information is not available).</td></tr><tr><td>CVC</td><td>Meet two criteria:(1)theVCis not classified as GVC,and (2)theVChas a uniquecorporateshareholder thatowns over99%ofits equity orif theVC'sbusinessscopeinvolves offeringproducts andservices.</td></tr><tr><td>IVC</td><td>Either meet criteria (1) and (2)or meet criteria (1)and (3):(1)the VCis not classified as GVC or CVC,(2)professional and person shareholders own thelargest total equity(or are thelargest group of shareholders if the equity ratio information is not available),and (3)the VChas more than two corporate shareholders but none of them owns over</td></tr><tr><td>BVC</td><td>99% of its equity.

This data included ordinal, discrete, and textual data, requiring different pre-processing techniques. We pre-processed these various types of data for machine learning.  \n\nFirst, regarding ordinal data (e.g., investment rounds), we transformed them into discrete data by using the tenth quantile as the range of classification. Second, as for ordinal and discrete data (e.g., locations, industries, registered capital transformed), we used one-hot encoding to transform them to be dummy variables. Third, we pre-processed textual data, similar to what we did to the textual data of shareholders: We kept Chinese or English characters and numbers only. Next, we adopted two dictionaries (i.e., enterprise information dictionary, finance dictionary) from Jieba to segment words and applied stopwords to remove unimportant words or connectives. After that, we used TF-IDF to process each VC's name and introduction, followed by low variance filtering to delete low-variance variables. After data pre-processing, we obtained the representation of textual data.  \n\nStep 2.2 Use supervised machine learning to predict VC types. The machine learning algorithm is capable of predicting the type of a VC only for mutually exclusive VC type but struggles to generate predictions for non-exclusive VC type. This limitation arises from the difficulty faced by the algorithm in learning and predicting the various affliations a VC might have in the absence of shareholder information. Thus, we employed machine learning to implement a mutually exclusive coding scheme for VC types. Specifically, the machine identifies whether a VC falls under the categories of GVC, CVC, IVC, BVC, FVC, UVC, PenVC, or if it's unable to classify a VC into any category.  \n\nStep 2.2.1 Sample split. We used Chen et al's VCAC dataset7, obtained 6,379 VCs that had basic information from CVSource as well as an assigned VC type, and divided this sample into a training dataset and a test dataset as $80\\%$ $'5,103\\mathrm{VCs})$ and $20\\%$ $(1,276\\mathrm{VCs})$  \n\nStep 2.2.2 Model training. Similar to shareholder-level prediction, at VC level we applied Xgboost prediction model because it outperformed other models, with the highest accuracy consistently across all types. Table 7 listed the details.  \n\nStep 2.2.3 Keyword-based prediction. Similarly, for cases with low prediction power in Step 2.2.2, we implemented some heuristics specifically designed for Type 2 (CVC), Type 3 (IVC), Type 4 (BVC), and Type 5 (FVC) prediction, as shown in Table 8. By manually developing some additional heuristics as outlined in Table 8, the F1-scores exhibited notable improvements. Specifically, the F1-score increased to 0.86 for Type 2 (CVC), to 0.88 for Type 4 (BVC), and to 0.55 for Type 5 (FVC), indicating a noteworthy enhancement. We did not develop any heuristics for Type 6 (UVC) because its low F1-score was mainly due to its limited number of observations in the training dataset instead of its overlapping with other categories, and human screening was applied to improve itscategorization.  \n\nStep 2.2.4 Screening cross-labels. The machine learning algorithm may suggest multiple types for a VC. Upon further examination, there were 5 instances of cross-labelling between VC categories, as shown in Table 9. To address the issue of cross-labelled VCs, we followed the same double-checking process as we did for shareholders in Step 1.2.4, using public sources of VC information such as VC names, offcial websites, press releases, and media reports.  \n\nTable 7. F1-scores of Xgboost predicting VC type based on the results of test dataset. It reports the F1-scores of the Xgboost model predicting VC type in the test dataset. Note: Each type's prediction is independent of other types'; in other words, a VC may be labelled positive for two or more types.

Cross-labels on VC-type classification by machine learning algorithms. It reports the number of crosslabelled VCs by machine learning till step 2.2.3.  \n\nStep 2.3 Invite human coders to directly judge on VC type. So far, out of the 12,729 VCs lacking shareholder information, 5,506 VCs were successfully categorized by machine learning algorithms. For the rest (7,223 VCs) that did not have adequate VC level information or machine learning could not yield the anticipated results for their types, two independent human coders were invited to directly determine VC types, following a two-step approach. Cohen's Kappa statistic between their results was 0.9936, indicating a high inter-rater reliability. An author stepped in as the third coder to settle the disagreements between the two coders.  \n\nFirst, based on allthe information from public sources, each human coder determined whether a VC belongs to a type, as outlined in Table 10. For example, when determining GVC, we mainly relied on Qichacha’s label for public agency or SOE and we double-checked the quality of Qichacha's labelling. If a VC investor is labelled as public agency or SOE according to Qichacha, we directly determined it as GVC. If Qichacha does not have the information, we resorted to a set of public sources (e.g., Tianyancha, Baidu, Bloomberg, Crunchbase, Google, government websites, PEdata, ITJuzi, news reports, VCs' official websites, Sogou) to classify whether it is GVC, adopting Chen et al's? definition of GVC7. When determining other types of VCs, we mainly relied on information from the same set of public sources to pinpoint the VCs main business scope to make direct judgement on VC types.  \n\n### Data Records  \n\nThe ChinaVCtype dataset can be accessed through figshare.com16. It consists of two plain text files in CSV format, namely, “ChinaVCtype.csv\" and “Alias.csv?\"  \n\nThe “ChinaVCtype.csv” file provides the type of 49,187 VCs that have made investments in China between 1978 to 2021. The definitions of variables are listed below:  \n\n1. VC_fullname: A string variable that denotes the full name of a VC.   \n2. Unified_social_credit_ ID: A string variable that denotes the unified social credit ID of a VC, if available.   \n3. GVCagency_ne: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as public agency-affliated based on the non-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise. A missing value indicates that the information on this variable is lacking.   \n4. GVCagency_equity: A continuous variable that represents the total equity owned by public agency shareholders in a VC. Noteworthy, the value of GVCagency_equity could be underestimated if the equity ratio of a public-agency shareholder for a VC is missing. And a missing value of GVCagency_equity indicates that equity ratio data for the VC is not available.   \n5. GVCsoe_ne: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as SOE-affliated based on the non-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise. A missing value indicates that the information on this variable is lacking.   \n6. GVCsoe_equity: A continuous variable that represents the total equity owned by SOE shareholders in a VC. Noteworthy, the value of GVCsoe_equity could be underestimated if the equity ratio of an SOE shareholder for a VC is missing. And a missing value of GVCsoe_equity indicates that equity ratio data for the VC is not available.   \n7. IVC_ ne: A dummy variable that equals 1 ifa VC is labelled as IVC based on the non-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise. A missing value indicates that the information on this variable is lacking.   \n8. CVC_ne: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as CVC based on the non-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise. A missing value indicates that the information on this variable is lacking.   \n9. BVC_ne: A dummy variable that equals ifa VC is labelled as BVC based on the non-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise. A missing value indicates that the information on this variable is lacking.   \n10. FVC_ne: A dummy variable that equals 1 ifa VC is labelled as FVC based on the non-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise. A missing value indicates that the information on this variable is lacking.   \n11. UVC_ne: A dummy variable that equals 1 ifa VC is labelled as UVC based on the non-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise. A missing value indicates that the information on this variable is lacking. Pen VC_ne: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as PenVC based on the non-exclusive V( type coding, and O otherwise. A missing value indicates that the information on this variable is lacking.   \n13. GVC_excl: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as GVC based on the mutually-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise.   \n14. GVC_equity: A continuous variable that represents the total equity owned by public agency-affliated and SOE-affliated shareholders in a VC. Noteworthy, the value of GVC_equity could be underestimated if the equity ratio of a shareholder for a VC is missing. And a missing value of GVC_equity means that equity ratio data for the VC is not available.   \n15. CVC_excl: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as CVC based on the mutually-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise.   \n16. IVC_excl: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as IVC based on the mutually-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise.   \n17. BVC_excl: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as BVC based on the mutually-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise.   \n18. FVC_excl: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as FVC based on the mutually-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise.   \n19. UVC_excl: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as UVC based on the mutually-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise.   \n20. Pen VC_excl: A dummy variable that equals 1 if a VC is labelled as PenVC based on the mutually-exclusive VC type coding, and O otherwise.   \n21. Unknown: A dummy variable that equals 1 ifa VC is labelled as unknown VC, and 0 otherwise. For this variable, both non-exclusive andmutually-exclusive VCtype coding generated the same.   \n22. Direct _judge: A string variable that indicates whether a VC's type is determined at the VC level or the shareholder level. It has three possible values: (1) “No\": This value indicates that the case is judged at the shareholder level because shareholder infor  \n\nTable 10.

Corporate_parent: A string variable that denotes a CVC's corporate parent, if available.   \n24. Parent_unifed_social_credit _ID: A string variable that denotes the unified social credit ID of a CVC's corporate parent, if available.   \n25. Parent_industry_qc: A string variable that denotes the industry of a CVC's corporate parent, according to Qichacha's industry classification.   \n26. Parent_listed: A string variable that indicates whether a CVC's corporate parent is publicly listed or not. It has three possible values:   \n(1) “Listed\": This value indicates that the parent firm is a publicly listed firm as of July 2024.   \n(2) “Delisted\": This value indicates that the parent firm had been listed previously but was already delisted by the time of observation in July 2024.   \n(3) Blank: The parent firm is not listed yet.  \n\n27. Parent _listedmarket: A string variable that denotes the listed stock market of a CVC's corporate parent. . Parent_stockcode: A string variable that denotes the stock code ofa CVC's corporate parent.  \n\nThe “Alias.csv\" fle lists all the alias names for VCs, to further improve the matching by users. It also includes the alias names of 529 VCs that appeared in Chen et al.'s7 VCAC dataset but not in our ChinaVCtype.csv, to enhance the compatibility of our dataset. In addition, if a VC's name is shown in China VCtype.csv but not in the Alias.csv, it indicates that the VC does not have an alias in our dataset. The total number of records in Alias.csv is 43,428, with variable definitions listed below:  \n\n1. VC_fullname: A string variable that denotes the full name of a VC. This is the same name used in \\*ChinaVCtype.csv?\"   \n2. Alias: A string variable that denotes the alias name of a VC. A VC could have multiple alias names, each being listed in separate rows.  \n\n### TechnicalValidation  \n\nTo ensure the quality of the dataset, the following measures were implemented:  \n\nUpon dataset composition: Matching VC names between multiple sources. One difficulty in developing our dataset is to match VC names among multiple sources (e.g, CVSource, Qichacha) when they adopt different forms of VC names. To start, we referred to CVSource's deal database and compiled an initial list of 49,589 VCs that have invested in China before the end of 2021; however, most VC names are abbreviated in CVSource's deal database. This presented a challenge in matching these names with their full versions and searching for their shareholder information in public sources.  \n\nTo address this challenge and ensure the accuracy of our VC full names, we employed a multi-step approach. First, because an organization's unified social credit ID (e.g., 91310000691612937 A, GP Capital Co., Ltd.) or its industrial and commercial registration number (e.g., 310000000096327, GP Capital Co., Ltd.) could be its unique identifier in China, we first applied these two pieces of information, if available in CVSource, to get VCs full names. Specifically, we collected VCs' unified social credit ID (e.g., 91310000691612937 A, Shanghai GP Capital) and full names from CVSource's GP (general partner) database, resulting in 13,767 VCs with such information. Second, in cases where CVSource's GP database did not contain this information, we used VCs' abbreviated names to search in Qichacha database. Specifically, we resorted to Qichacha's “firm name cleaning\" function as a solution. This feature, available in Qichacha's professional version (pro.qcc.com), retrieves a firm's full name when an abbreviated name is submitted. We submitted all variations of VCs names recorded in CVSource (i.e., a VC's abbreviated name, its corresponding GP name, its corresponding LP name when it acts as a limited partner) to Qichacha's “frm name cleaning\" function. A key advantage of Qichacha's “firm name cleaning? function is that it can provide a firm's full current name when an abbreviated or previous name is submitted. This step has led to the successful matching of 31,106 VC full names. We also collected their unified social credit ID or industrial and commercial registration number if available in Qichacha's “firm name cleaning? In total, the above two steps resulted in 44,873 full names of VCs, and there were 4,716 VCs that could not be matched with CVSource's GP or Qichacha databases using their names.  \n\nNext, we conducted a comprehensive search in Qichacha database for the shareholder information of the 44,873 VCs using their full names. Our search revealed that out of these VCs, 36,860 had available shareholder information that covered 119,760 unique shareholders, and 8,013 VCs lacked shareholder information due to their status as either foreign or deregistered entities. For the 36,860 VCs with shareholder data, we categorized them following the shareholder-based judgement procedures outlined in Part I of Fig. 1. For the 8,0i3 VCs devoid of shareholder information, we directly determined their types following the direct judgement procedures given in Part II of Fig. 1.  \n\n![](images/7e7f735f4c14244b8ed19e26d12dc68100742eb269e82263f74027427af2680b.jpg)  \nFig. 2 The process of identifying VC full names. This figure provides a visual representation of the entire process involved in identifying the full names of VCs.  \n\nAdditionall, for the remaining 4,716 VCs that could not be matched with CVSource's GP or Qichacha databases using their names, we manually searched for their full names in public sources and directly classified them, again adhering to the procedures detailed in Part II of Fig. 1. In total, we classified 12,729 VCs directly without reliance on shareholder information.  \n\nUpon acquiring the full names of VCs, we thoroughly consolidated the list. This process uncovered that a VC might have several different names within the CVSource dataset.For instance,“杭州阿里巴巴创业投资管理有 限公司”(Hangzhou Alibaba Venture Capital Management Co., Ltd.) and “阿里巴巴创投\" (Alibaba VC) denote the same VC firm. After eliminating these duplicate instances, we compiled a definitive list of 49,187 unique VCs identified by their full names.  \n\nFigure 2 depicts the entire process of identifying the full names of VCs.  \n\nUpon direct judgement on VC types by human coders: Triangulating across coders.  In directly judging the types of 12,729 VCs, 5,506 were successfully categorized by machine learning algorithms, while the remaining 7,223 that did not have complete information necessary for machine learning required further manual classification by human coders. The human coders conducted a thorough review of public sources to ensure accuracy. To maintain quality control, we formed a four-person team consisting of two master students with relevant industry experience and two authors. The third author provided training and quality checks for student research assistants until they met our standards. The research assistants then classified the VCs, with the third author conducting a double-check of any inconsistent results. If disagreements persisted, the first author was consulted to resolve the issue and achieve a final decision. This rigorous process helps ensure the quality of human coding.  \n\nUpon the results ofVC type classification: Comparing with prior studies. To verify the quality of the ChinaVCtype dataset, we merged it with CVSource, profiled the distributions according to VC types (e.g.. numbers of VCs by type, investment deals by type), and compared the results with those in prior studies.  \n\nFigure 3 shows the distribution of VCs by their type in China's market between 1978 and 2021, using a mutually-exclusive coding of VC type. Out of the 49,187 VCs, $73.84\\%$ are IVCs, making them the largest group in China, followed by CVCs $(13.75\\%)$ ,GVCs $\\left(8.90\\%\\right)$ ,FVCs $(2.96\\%)$ ,BVCs $(0.25\\%)$ , and UVCs $(0.11\\%)$ .Because only 3 Pen VCs were identified, this category was omitted in the remaining analysis.  \n\nFigure 4 displays the distribution of investment deals by their lead VC's type in China between 1978 and 2021, using a mutually-exclusive coding of VC type. As shown in Fig. 4, during this period, IVCs made the most investments $(75.07\\%)$ in China’s market, followed by GVCs $(12.59\\%)$ ,CVCs $(8.13\\%)$ , and FVCs $(3.94\\%)$ ,while BVCs and UVCs contributed less than $1\\%$ each. Noteworthy, while the total number of GVCs is fewer than that of CVCs (see Fig. 3), they were more active in China's market compared to CVCs (see Fig. 4).  \n\nFigure 5 displays the annual trend of investment deals made by each type of VC (i.e., the lead VC) in China's market between 2000 and 2021, using a mutually-exclusive coding of VC type. Data before 2000 were dropped in the trend analysis due to their scantiness. As shown in Fig. 5, the number of deals invested by each type of VC experienced ups and downs during the reported period and crested in 2016. However, since IVC's predominant proportion may obscure others? trends, an extra comparison excluding IVC is shown in Fig. 6. It is now clear that both GVCs and FVCs peaked their deal numbers in 2016, while CVCs reached their peak two years later.  \n\n![](images/989ced387e28e8eccf3610c1274be98daa21197f546fb5d80f5c51fa8649bacb.jpg)  \nFig. 3 Number of VCs by affliation.

This figure reports the distribution of investment deals by the type of lead VC in China's market between 1978 and 2021.  \n\nNext, we compared these results with previous studies that have conducted thorough manual checks on VC type to overcome the limitations of existing databases. Specifically, we focus on the results of GVC or CVC studies. While IVC is the largest group, GVC and CVC have their unique characteristics, and analyzing these two groups can better validate whether our data can well distinguish among VC types.  \n\n![](images/97dc837f6c1018f5f2870fdb55bbd210cdbb3d50f6f97dff941c338c84d1c0b3.jpg)  \nFig. 5 Number of investment deals by VC type.

This figure reports the number of investment deals made by GVCs, CVCs, FVCs, BVCs, and UVCs in China's market between 2000 and 2021.  \n\nRegarding GVC studies in the context of China, three exemplars have been identified. Suchard et al. sampled 4,700 entrepreneurial firms that received first-round investments from 1,254 VCs between 1988 and 2011, and hand-collected “data on government ownership of a VC through VC profles, web searches, and the Chinese company registration database (NECIPS):\"5 In their sample, 240 VCs were classified as GVCs, accounting for $19.14\\%$ . For our study, we restricted our sample to all first-round investments before the end of 2011, identifying a total of $1{,}885\\mathrm{VCs}$ among which, 361 were GVCs, a percentage of $19.15\\%$ that is comparable to Suchard et al's observation. Additionally, Suchard et al. reported that \"\\*We obtain government percentage ownership data from company registration records for $78\\%$ of these [GVCs]. The average government ownership of a VC is $74\\%$ ?5 In our sample, $84.49\\%$ of the 361 GVCs have government percentage ownership data, and the average government ownership ofa VC is $86.01\\%$ . Based on these comparisons, we find that our sample is more comprehensive than Suchard et al's (in terms of sample size and ownership data) and our descriptive statistics are consistent with theirs, reassuring the quality of China VCtype dataset.  \n\nZhang and Mayes collected a list of VCs from PEdata database between 1991 and $2010^{6}$ .They restricted GVCs to be those owned and controlled by government agencies (i.e., excluding GVCs that were mainly owned by SOEs), and to identify their targeted GVCs, they “check[ed] the detailed description of venture capital firms in PEdata and augment[ed] the data by cross-checking the offcial website of each VC firm to ensure a reliable identification?6 In addition, for their research purpose, they only kept ventures receiving first-round investments from a GVC or non-GVC solo investor (i.e., no syndicate), and dropped deals if investment amount information is missing. In total, they ended with “2,554 VC-backed portfolio companies, of which 436 are backed by GVCs\", translating to a GVC investment ratio of $17.07\\%0^{6}$ . To mimic their sampling strategy, we restricted our sample to A-round deals that were made before the end of 2010, had only one VC investor, and had investment amount information. Also, following their definition of GVC, we kept only GVCs that were owned and controlled by government agencies by dropping GVCs with a ratio of SOE equity no less than $50\\%$ . This resulted in a sample consisting of 2,663 VC-backed ventures, out of which 463 are backed by GVCs, translating to a GVC investment ratioof $1\\dot{7}.39\\%$ . Our results, regardless of using the total number of GVC investments or GVC investment ratio, are similar to those of Zhang and Mayes. This is remarkable, especially considering that our dataset and theirs adopted different sources (CVSource vs. PEdata) and coding methods (machine learning vs. manual coding).  \n\nIn addition, Zhang17 collected a sample of first-round VC investments in China between 1995 and 2011 from PEdata, and manually coded if a VC was GVC or not. She defined GVCs as those established, mainly funded, and managed by the government. In her sample, out of 5,222 first-round investment deals, 1,052 were made by GVCs, resulting in a GVC investment ratio of $20.14\\%$ . Based on our dataset and using the same sampling strategy, we ended with 5,578 first-round investment deals between 1995 and 2011, of which 1,238 were invested by GVCs (with state equity ratio no less than $20\\%$ ), indicating a GVC investment ratio of $22.19\\%$ .The GVC investment ratio is nearly the same across her and our samples. Moreover, in terms of syndication or not, Zhang divided GVC deals into 611 GVC-solo deals ( $58.10\\%$ of all GVC deals) and 441 GVC-syndication deals. In comparison, our sample contained 750 GVC-solo deals $(60.58\\%$ of all GVC deals) and 384 GVC-syndication deals. The distributions of GVC sub-type investments between our sample and Zhang's are roughly consistent, and the difference between the two might be attributed to the different sources (CVSource vs. PEdata) used to identify if a deal was solo or syndication.  \n\nSecond, regarding CVC studies in the context of China, Dushnitsky and $\\mathrm{Yu}\\mathrm{\\'}s^{1}$ study is the only one that has reported statistics of CVC activity in China using manually coded data', which can be a benchmark for comparison. They collected data from five different sources, including ThomsonOne, CapitalIQ, CVSource, PEdata, and ITJuzi, and integrated them to form a proprietary dataset. They defined an investor as a CVC “if it was an industrial company or the affiliated sub-unit (such as a wholly-owned subsidiary or a majority-owned subsidiary) of an industrial company?1 Our definition of CVC is identical to theirs, which not only includes narrowly defined strategic VC/PE investors but also covers corporates that have made CVC investments but not yet established a dedicated VC for this corporate venturing purpose. To build their dataset, Dushnitsky and Yu started with all VCs that were publicly listed (excluding real-estate and financial sectors), manually identified CVCs by using their main business scope and shareholder information, and compared their classification “with the investor's type field in the databases and ran another check to confirm whether any CVC investors were erroneously omitted.?1 In addition, they dropped CVCs that made less than three deals during the observation period. As revealed by their final dataset, 173 publicly listed CVCs have disbursed 3,571 CVC investments between 2013 and 2017; on average, each publicly listed CVC made 4 deals in a year. Following their sampling strategy (i.e., excluding real-estate and financial sectors and dropping CVCs with less than three deals), our results show that 513 CVCs have made 4,129 CVC investments between 2013 and 2017; on average, each CVC made 1.6 deals in a year. That is, we discovered 340 more CVCs than Dushnitsky and Yu did (which discrepancy could be attributed to private CVCs), and our number of CVC deals was 558 more than theirs (which discrepancy may also be due to private CVC deals). This difference in the average CVC's annual deal number is reasonable because private CVCs, on average, invested in fewer deals than publicly listed CVCs did.  \n\nTable 11 provides a summary of the comparisons made between our dataset on GVC or CVC investments and prior studies that used manual coding on VC types. We used the same definitions of GVC or CVC and followed their sampling strategies in each comparison. The results consistently show that the ChinaVCtype dataset is of high quality.  \n\n### Usaqe Notes  \n\nThe CSV fles are encoded in UTF-8 and separated by commas. The VC names are in Chinese.  \n\nWe will maintain the dataset in the future and may add new features or variables as they emerge from our research or are suggested by the users of our dataset. In this case, a log file willbe provided to inform users of any new features added to the dataset.  \n\nImplications.Building on Chen et al's previously developed VCAC dataset and leveraging more advanced machine learning techniques, in this study, we have developed a new dataset, i.e., ChinaVCtype, to provide the classification for VC types in China's market. The ChinaVCtype dataset has advantages over the VCAC dataset in two important ways.  \n\nFirst, ChinaVCtype covers a wider range of VCs in China's market than VCAC because we have adopted a broader definition of VC to cover not only narrowly defined VCs/PEs but also other organizations that directly invest venture capital in ventures. In contrast, Chen et al.7 followed a narrow definition of VC that mainly covered VCs/PEs in CVSource. Adopting a broader definition of VC is extremely valuable because there is a significant increase in organizations that have made VC investments in China but have not yet established their VC arms dedicated to this purpose.

To illustrate the potential of adopting a broader definition of VCs that follows ongoing research trends, Table 12 shows a comparison between VCAC and China VCtype in terms of applying different VC definitions. If we adopt the same definition as Chen et al.? by using CVSource's label on VCs/PEs, the number of VCs between 2000 and 2016 is 10,932, slightly more than Chen et al.7; the discrepancy may be attributed to CVSource's continuous updates on their VC/PE labels. It shows the wider coverage of ChinaVCtype compared to VCAC. Moreover, if we adopt a broader definition, this number will increase to 23,726. The comparison becomes even more significant between 2017 and 2021: 13,622 narrowly defined VCs versus 33,906 broadly defined VCs, partially due to Chinas continuous policy support towards entrepreneurship and the launch of the STAR Market (Science and Technology Innovation Board)  \n\nTable 15.

Given the dramatic increase in organizations that play the role of VCs in providing venture capital to startups, investigations into these broadly defined VCs can provide a more complete understanding of China’s VC market and its interplay with entrepreneurship and innovation.  \n\nSecond, ChinaVCtype includes a wider array of variables compared to VCAC to enhance dataset quality. For example, VCAC utilizes the full names of VCs as the index for users matching, which may, however, change over time. To address this issue, ChinaVCtype not only provides the full names of VCs but also includes their unified social credit ID if such information is accessible on Qichacha, in order to assist users in aligning their data with our VC classification. Another example is the corporate parents of CVCs. While VCAC lists the names of corporate parents for CVCs, it only includes 368 corporate parents. In contrast, China VCtype expands this number to 3,508—approximately ten times that of VCAC. Beyond just names, ChinaVCtype provides additional details about corporate parents, such as their unified social credit ID, industry sector, public listing status, and the markets where they are listed. The increased sample of corporate parents and these additional variables pertaining to CVCs can foster new avenues of research in this field.  \n\nDespite its notable advantages over VCAC, China VCtype does have some limitations of which researchers should be aware. Unlike VCAC, which is a panel dataset accounting for changes in a VC's type due to shareholder changes over time, ChinaVCtype remains cross-sectional for some reasons. We acknowledge that it is meaningful to reveal type dynamics by using a panel approach.Take 浙江浙大友创投资管理有限公司(Zhejiang Zheda Youchuang Investment Management Co., Ltd) from the VCAC dataset as an example. It started as a UVC in 2000,changed to a GVC in 2008 due to the entry ofa public-agency-type shareholder—浙江新通留学有限公司 (Zhejiang Shinyway Education Group), and subsequently shifted to an IVC in 2014 because of the departure of the public-agency-type shareholder and the entry of two private firm shareholders. Nevertheless, due to the drastic increase in our sample size, collecting historical shareholder information of 49,187 VCs over 43 years would be financially costly. It might be economically more reasonable to remain cross-sectional also because the proportion of VCs that experienced type changes in VCAC is only $3.32\\%$ (i.e., $212{\\mathrm{VCs}}$ 0.Among them,174 VCs changed once, 31 changed twice, 4 changed three times, 2 changed four times, and 1 changed five times. In addition, only 72 had experienced a switch between a private type and a GVC type, accounting for $1.12\\%$ Oof VCAC's whole sample. These suggest that in China, changes in VC types are uncommon. Generally, since VCs are light-asset companies and the fund management license is not scarce, registering a new VC is often more straightforward and less problematic than altering the type of an existing one. Consider the transition between GVCs and private VCs as an example. GVCs typically lack the incentive to become private because the primary objective of state capital in VCs is to attract private investment, not to convert private VCs into state-controlled VCs. Even if individuals within a GVC wish to adopt a private structure,the simplest way is to register a new, private VC firm, thereby avoiding potential issues related to state asset loss. Conversely, while some private fund management teams might acquire stakes in GVCs to improve fundraising from SOEs, this is an infrequent occurrence because it would be more flexible to form syndications with GVCs, thereby avoiding the complexities of ownership changes. Given this backdrop, it is logical for ChinaVCtype to remain a cross-sectional format, weighing the costs and benefits; nevertheless, this approach may not serve researchers interested in the dynamics ofVCtypes.  \n\nTo alleviate this concern, we offer insights into the dynamics of VC types using VCAC dataset, enabling researchers to utilize ChinaVCtype with caution. First, Table 13 reports the total times of changes for each type of VCs. It indicates that IVCs experienced the most changes compared to other types of VCs, followed by FVCs, GVCs, and CVCs. No PenVCs experienced a type change.  \n\nSecond, Table 14 provides more details regarding the direction of changes, indicating that the most frequent direction of changes is from FVC to IVC (45 times),followed by GVC to IVC (40 times) and IVC to FVC (40 times). Thus, studies on FVC, IVC, and GVCs should be more cautious about VC-type changes than studies on other types of VCs.  \n\nThird, researchers may also be interested in the trend of changes. As illustrated in Table 15, although the instances of VCs changing their types seem to increase over time, peaking at 77 in 2016, the proportion of VCs undergoing type changes within the entire sample has remained very low. On the one hand, this finding alleviates the potential drawbacks of remaining China VCtype cross-sectional; on the other hand, it does hint that studies on more recent VC markets shall be more careful in interpreting their results based on China VCtype.  \n\n### Code availability  \n\nThe program used for machine learning is Python.

Exploiting the timing of VC exit, we find that the CSR performance of VC-backed companies improves after the exit of VC. Using the age of VC funds as an instrument for VC exit, we find that the effect is likely to be causal.

In particular, compared with other institutional investors, VCs have shorter investment horizons, and hence may not care about the long term welfare of other stakeholders (Chemmanur et al., 2011). On the other hand, VCs, like other institutional investors, could be concerned with social norms and motivated by social returns (Dyck et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020). Furthermore, VCs may value the benefits brought by better CSR performance, such as product market differentiation and insurance against negative outcomes, more than other investors (Servaes and Tamayo, 2013; Lins et al., 2017; Albuquerque et al., 2019; and Hong et al., 2019). In particular, the social performance of VC firms may affect their ability to raise money from their investors (Hartzmark and Sussman, 2019). As such, VCs may push for better CSR performance of their portfolio companies. It is therefore unclear ex ante how VC involvement and monitoring could affect their portfolio companies' CSR performance.  \n\nWe examine the effect of VC involvement and monitoring on CSR performance using data from China. One challenge in studying the relationship between VC and CSR is that VCs are involved in mostly private and newly public companies; however, most CSR databases, such as the MSCI KLD index and Thomson Reuters' ASSET4 ratings, cover mostly large and mature companies. Several unique features of the Chinese VC industry and the CSR rating data enable us to overcome this challenge. First, the CSR rating data, provided by Hexun.com, cover all publicly traded companies in China and allow us to examine the impact of VCs on CSR performance of newly public companies.2 Second, VCs in China often remain involved in their portfolio companies and influence the operation and governance of those companies long after IPO (Barry et al., 1990; Hochberg, 2012; Wongsunwai, 2013; and lliev and Lowry, 2021). According toZero2IPO's data, over $52.86\\%$ of VCs in China held shares of their portfolio companies more than three years after the IPO during 2008-2015. In our sample, the median VC also remains in their portfolio companies three years after the IPO. Third, Chinese VCs hold significant stakes in their portfolio companies after IPO. In our sample, conditional on VCs remaining in their portfolio companies after the IPO, VCs hold an average of $6.78\\%$ of the total shares of the portfolio companies. VCs therefore remain as one of the largest, if not the largest, shareholder of their portfolio companies even after IPOs in China.? This provides us with a unique opportunity to examine the effect of VC on their portfolio companies’ CSR performance.  \n\nExamining newly public companies also makes it easier to deal with the selection problem common in the VC literature (Sorensen, 2007 and Da Rin et al., 2013) because we do not use the variation in which companies receive VC funding. Instead, we exploit the variation generated by VC exit. In particular, the securities law in China mandates that VCs, along with other investors who also hold shares before the IPO, disclose all their selling transactions after the IPO. We are therefore able to identify the exact dates of final VC exits after the IPO. Focusing on newly public firms in China, we first conduct a stacked difference-in-differences (DID) analysis of the impact of VC exit on their portfolio companies’ CsR performance. In this setting, we exploit the changes in VC involvement generated by VC exit; as such, we suffer less from the selection issue. The remaining endogeneity concern is the timing of VC exit, which we addresslater.4  \n\nWith the stacked DID, we find that the CSR performance of VC-backed companies improves after the exit of VC. In particular, VC involvement is negatively associated with portfolio companies? responsibility toward employees, suppliers and customers, and the environment. In sharp contrast, VC involvement is positively associated with portfolio companies? responsibility toward shareholders and other measures of shareholder value, suggesting that VCs pressure their portfolio companies to maximize shareholder value at the expense of other stakeholders and the environment.5 To trace the timing of the negative effect of VC on CsR, we find that the positive effect of VC exit on CSR performance appears only after, but not before, the exit of VCs, thereby suggesting that the results are unlikely to be driven by VCs’ reaction to changes in firm fundamentals.  \n\nThe VC exit decisions are certainly not random (Gompers and Lerner, 1998; Lin and Smith, 1998; and Paeglis and Veeren, 2013), which could bias the stacked DID results. To mitigate this concern, we use the age of the VC funds as an instrumental variable for VC exit decisions. Most VC funds are organized as limited partnerships and have a limited lifetime. VCs are more likely to exit from their portfolio companies when approaching the end of their lifetime. As such, the VC fund age is likely to satisfy the relevance condition. To satisfy the exclusion condition, the age of VC funds can only affect their portfolio companies' CSR performance through its impact on exit timing. However, as documented in Kandel et al. (2011) and Barrot (2017), the age of VC funds can affect investment choices. If the choices are correlated with CsR performance, the exclusion condition will be violated. To mitigate this concern, we show that the age of VC funds has no effect on CSR performance or changes in CSR performance before the exit of VCs, thereby suggesting that the fund age is unlikely to directly impact CSR performance. Using this instrument, we find similar results from the two-stage least square (2SLS) regressions, suggesting that the negative effect of VC on CSR performance is likely to be causal.  \n\nNext, we proceed to examine the heterogeneity of the effect of VC on CSR performance. First, we distinguish between VCs that sit on the board of directors of their portfolio companies and those that do not. Consistent with the fact that VCs on the board can monitor more effectively, we find that the negative impact of VC on CSR performance concentrates on VCs that are on the board of directors. Second, we explore the heterogeneity in VC experience, performance, and reputation. We construct three proxies, namely the total amount of historical investment, the total numbers of firms brought to IPOs, and the share of the total market value of companies brought to IPOs, as measures of VC experience, performance, and reputation. Using these proxies, we find that the negative effect of VC on CSR performance is driven mostly by less experienced, badly performing, or less reputable VCs. This result suggests that the negative impact may disappear as VCs become more mature and care more about their reputation. Because domestic VCs in China are relatively young and less experienced, what we document in this paper may not be generalizable to more developed countries, in which VCs are more mature and more experienced.  \n\nFinally, we explore the heterogeneity in the types of VC sponsors. Specifically, we categorize VCs into three groups, those sponsored by domestic private institutions (PVC), those sponsored by local governments (GVC), and those sponsored by foreign institutions (FVC). Interestingly, both PVCs and GVCs have a strong negative impact on their portfolio companies' CSR performance. However, FVCs have no negative impact on CSR performance. The results again suggest that the negative impact of VCs on CSR performance may be limited to Chinese domestic VCs.  \n\nOur paper contributes to the literature on the impact of VCs on their portfolio companies. The early literature shows that VCs are actively involved in their portfolio companies. VCs often sit on the board of directors, help to raise capital, and mentor company founders (Sahlman, 1990; Lerner, 1994; Lerner, 1995; Hellmann and Puri, 2000). Hellmann and Puri (2002) find that VCs improve professionalization of their portfolio companies. Wasserman (2006) and Kaplan et al. (2012) both find that VCs are involved in CEO replacement. Bottazzi et al. (2008) measure VCs’ value adding services by looking at specific actions VCs take in their portfolio companies. Bernstein et al. (2016) identify the causal effect of VC monitoring by exploiting exogenous variation in VC monitoring intensity generated by the introduction of new airline routes between VCs and their portfolio companies. Most papers in this literature examine the impact of VCs on operation, innovation, and successful exit (IPO or merger). Our paper contributes to the literature by instead studying the impact of VC on portfolio companies' social performance.  \n\nIn this regard, our paper is closest to Alakent et al. (2020) and Li et al. (2021). Alakent et al. (2020) find that US firms backed by VCs before IPOs have worse CSR performance. Instead, Li et al. (2021) find that VC-backed Chinese firms have better CSR performance. Our paper differs from these two papers along the following dimensions. First, both papers examine the impact of VC backing during the pre-IPO period on CSR performance after IPO; therefore, it is unclear why the impact of VC could last long after IPO. We instead identify the impact of actual VC involvement on CSR performance. Second, both papers rely only on cross-sectional variation in VCbacking, while we only rely on time series variation in VC involvement. The time-series variation allows us to better mitigate the selection bias. Furthermore, we are able to use the age of VC funds to generate plausibly exogenous variation in VC exits and hence are able to further mitigate endogeneity concerns.6  \n\nOur paper also contributes to the literature on the causes and consequences of CSR performance. Ferrell et al. (2016) find that wellgoverned firms with less severe agency problems engage more in CSR. Dyck et al. (2019) and Chen et al. (2020) find that institutional investors promote CSR. Dai et al. (2020) and Schiller (2020) find that corporate customers shape their suppliers' CSR practices. Houston and Shan (2021) find that banks can influence their borrowers’ CSR practices. Other papers in the literature examine the effect of CsR on firm value (Servaes and Tamayo, 2013; Flammer, 2015), knowledge spillover (Flammer and Kacperczyk, 2019), disaster insurance (Lins et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2019), and access to finance (Cheng et al., 2014). Our paper contributes to the literature by studying the impact of VC on CSR performance. Given the critical importance of VC in promoting innovation and economic growth, understanding their social impact can inform better public policy.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the sample construction proces; Section 3 presents the baseline results of the effect of VC on CSR performance; Section 4 presents the results on cross-sectional heterogeneity of the impact of VC on CSR performance; Section 5 provides some additional robustness test results; and Section 6 concludes the paper.  \n\n## 2. Data and summary statistics  \n\n### 2.1. Sample construction  \n\nWe start with all public firms in China. We obtain CSR measures from Hexun.com, the leading CSR rating system in China. We obtain VC information from the Zero2IPO database. We collect financial statement data and other firm-level information on listed firms from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. We then apply the following filters to the data. First, we exclude all financial firms; second, we exclude firms without VC at IPO; third, we exclude specially treated (ST or $S\\mathrm{T}^{*}$ ) stocks;and finally, we drop firms that went IPO before 2006 for two reasons. First, VCs only affect newly public companies; second, in 2006, the Chinese government implemented a massive accounting reform, causing differences in accounting items between firms that went public before and after 2006. Our final baseline sample consists of 2678 firm-year observations.  \n\n### 2.2. Measuring CSR  \n\nHexun.com, which was founded in 1996, was the first vertical financial portal and one of the largest financial and securities information service providers in China. Hexun.com began to provide CSR scores and ranking data for alisted companies in China in 2010. The measures are based on firms’ annual CSR reports and annual reports published by the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). In December 2008, the SHSE mandates that firms listed on its “\"Corporate Governance Sector\" (230 firms with the best governance practices at the time) issue a CSR report with their annual report beginning in the 2008 reporting year. Similarly, also in December 2008, the SZSE mandated listed firms on its “Shenzhen 100 Index\" to issue a CSR report (top 100 listed firms ranked by total market capitalization). In addition to companies mandated by the stock exchanges, an increasing number of companies voluntarily issue CSR reports. In our robustness checks, we show that the results are not driven by the self-selection of firms voluntarily issuing CSR reports.  \n\nIn addition to the CSR reports issued by these companies, Hexun evaluates the CSR activities of other companies based on their annual reports and other proprietary information. Most companies in our sample, those that went public after 2006 are not among those mandated by the SHSE or the SZSE, because the companies in our sample are relatively young and small. We provide a comparison between our sample and the universe of all public companies listed on SHSE and SZSE in Table 1. Over our sample period, the number of public companies in China increased from 2661 in 2011 to 3626 in 2017. The number of firms issuing CSR reports increased from 519 in 2011 to 795 in 2017. On the other hand, the total number of firms in our sample increased from 210 in 2011 to 577 in 2010, among which 22 firms issued a CSR report in 2011 and 67 firms issued a CSR report in 2017.  \n\nOne major advantage of using Hexun CSR rating data is that it covers all listed companies, and hence, our analysis is less subject to selection bias. Other CSR ratings for Chinese companies, such as the RKS rating, cover only firms that issue annual CSR reports. Furthermore, those firms are mostly mature firms and have very little VC involvement. One concern is that the Hexun CSR ratings may be constructed differently for firms with a CSR report and firms without a CSR report. To mitigate this concern, we control for whether a firm publishes a CSR report in one of our robustness tests, and still find similar results.  \n\nHexun.com evaluates the performance of listed firms along five dimensions: responsibility toward shareholders (SR), responsibility toward employees (ER), responsibility toward suppliers, consumers and customers (SCCR), responsibility toward the environment (EVR), and responsibility toward government (GR). In this paper, we focus on the three dimensions related to CSR, ER, SCCR, and EVR.  \n\nWhile Hexun mostly applies a unified rating scheme, it adjusts the rating slightly for several specific industries. We first describe the rating scheme for most industries. Responsibility toward employees (ER) is evaluated based on employee income and training opportunities (5 points), safety (5 points), and caring for employees (5 points). The maximum possible score for ER is 15 points. Responsibility toward suppliers, consumers and customers (SCCR) is evaluated based on product quality (7 points), customer satisfaction (3 points), and supply chain integrity (5 points). The maximum possible score for SCCR is 15 points. Responsibility toward the environment (EVR) is evaluated based on environmental awareness (2 points), certificates of environmental management systems (3 points), investment in environmental protection (5 points), pollutant emissions (5 points), and energy conservation (5 points). The maximum possible score for EVR is 20 points. We then calculate the total CSR score, CSR, as the sum of the scores of the three subcomponents.  \n\nHexun makes the following industry adjustments. For consumer product industries, the maximum score of responsibility toward employees is rescaled to 10 points, and the maximum score of responsibility toward suppliers, consumers and customers is rescaled to 20 points. For manufacturing industries, the maximum score for responsibility toward the environment is rescaled to 30 points. For service industries, the maximum scores of responsibility toward the environment is rescaled to 10 points.  \n\nHexun does not disclose the exact algorithm it uses to generate the ratings. To better understand its algorithm, we conduct a detailed analysis of some subcomponents for which the data can be obtained from annual reports. For example, one tertiary component of responsibility toward shareholders is the return on assets (ROA, 2 points). Each year, Hexun ranks ROA of all public firms, and the ROA rating for the firms is a monotonic transformation of the rankings of ROA. We provide the mapping for the ratings for which we can find the values of the original ranking variables in Appendix B. In general, the ratings are monotonic step functions of the rankings of theunderlying variable.  \n\n### 2.3.VC variables  \n\nWe collect VC data from the Zero2IPO database, which also provides information on VCs? portfolio firms. We exclude firms that do not have VC investment at the time of IPO. We define the variable, VC, as a dummy variable that equals one if there is at least one VC fund holding the shares of the firm during that year, and zero otherwise. We then decompose VC into VCs sponsored by domestic private institutions (PVC), VCs sponsored by local governments (GVC), and VCs sponsored by foreign institutions (FVC). To further examine the influence of VC directors, we manually collect data on VC directors from directors? resume data provided by CSMAR. If the resume shows that the director works in the VCs that invested in the same company, we record him or her as a VC director, and define VC_Board as one if the firm has at least one VC director on board, and zero otherwise. VC_Share is defined as the percentage of VC shareholdings.  \n\nTable 1 CSR reporting and sample distribution.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Year</td><td colspan=\"2\">All public

VC equals one if VCs hold shares of the firm, and zero otherwise. Other variable definitions are presented in Appendix A. All continuous variables are winsorized at the $1^{s t}$ and $99^{t h}$ percentiles.  \n\n### 2.4. Control variables  \n\nWe include a broad set of control variables in various specifications. We include firm characteristics, such as the natural logarithm of firm age (Log Age), the natural logarithm of total assets (Size), return on assets (ROA), leverage (Leverage), cash holding scaled by total assets (Cash) as control variables. Moreover, we control for corporate governance factors, such as whether the firm's CEO is also the chairman of the board (Dual), whether financial reports are audited by a big four accounting firm (Big 4), the percentage of the independent directors on the board of directors (Indep), and the percent of shares held by other institutional investors (Inst Own). We provide the definitions of all variables used in the paper in the appendix.  \n\n### 2.5. Summary statistics  \n\nPanel A of Table 2 reports the summary statistics of our main variables. The average total CSR score is 4.47 with a standard deviation of 10.04, indicating that there is significant variation in CSR performance among listed companies. The mean of ER is 2.30/15, SCCR is 1.08/15, and EVR is 1.09/20. The percentage of firms with at least one VC shareholder in a specific year (VC) is only $38\\%$ Although the average percentage of shares owned by VCs is only about 3.63, suggesting that most VCs continue to be a large, if not the largest shareholder, even after the company goes public.  \n\nThe average firm size (the natural logarithm of the total assets) is 21.39. The average leverage (Leverage) and annual ROA are 0.32 and 0.05, respectively. Different from US public companies, the percentage of shares owned by institutional investors other than VC is verysmall(about $6.91\\%$  \n\n### 2.6. CSR patterns of VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms  \n\nTo better understand the dynamics of the CSR performance of IPO firms, in particular, how CSR performance changes after IPO, we plot the average CSR scores of IPO firms without VC-backing with respect to years since the IPO in Panel A of Fig. 1. First, there is no particular pattern in CSR after the IPO. If anything, CSR gradually increases after the IPO. We then plot the CSR dynamics for firms with VC backing with respect to the years to VC exit in Panel B of Fig. 1. Two observations stand out. First, CSR performance barely changes before VC exits. Second, CSR performance increases after VC exits, providing preliminary evidence that VC involvement could lead to worseCSRperformance.  \n\n## 3. VC and CSR performance  \n\n### 3.1. Stacked difference-in-differences  \n\nGiven the staggered nature of VC exit, a generalized difference-in-differences analysis is likely to be biased (Callaway and Sant'Anna, 2021; Goodman-Bacon, 2021; Baker et al., 2022). To mitigate this concern, we instead estimate a stacked difference-indifferences specification. In particular, we use the following procedure to create a stacked sample. First, we group treated firms by the VC exit year. For example, firms whose VC exited in 2012 will be in the 2012 exit group, which we call a cohort. For cohort $t,$ we include the observations from t - 2 to $t+2$ for these treated firms. We then choose firms whose VC exited in years greater than $t+2$ Or whose VC never exited during our sample period as control firms for cohort t. We also include the observations from $t-2$ to $t+2$ for these control firms. This procedure ensures that we include only either yet-to-be treated firms or never treated firms as control firms, thereby eliminating the bias in the standard staggered difference-in-differences specification. We then stack all cohorts to form the stacked sample. We provide the summary statistics of the stacked sample in Panel B of Table 2.  \n\nWe examine the effect of VC involvement on the CSR performance of their portfolio firms using the following stacked DID specification,  \n\n$$\nC S R_{i,t,c}=\\alpha_{i,c}+\\alpha_{t,c}+\\beta V C_{i,t-1,c}+\\gamma X_{i,t-1,c}+\\varepsilon_{i,t,c},\n$$  \n\nwhere i indexes firm, t indexes year, and $c$ indexes the exit year or cohort; the dependent variables are the total CSR score (CSR) and subcomponents (ER, SCCR, and EVR) of firm i in year $t,$ the independent variable $V C_{i,t-1}$ $c$ is the VC existence dummy variable of firm i in year $t-1;X_{i,t-1,}$ $c$ is a set of firm-level control variables measured in year $t-1$ , and $\\alpha_{t,\\mathrm{~}c}$ and $\\alpha_{i,\\textit{c}}$ are cohort-year and cohort-firm fixed effects. All continuous variables are winsorized at the $1^{s t}$ and $99^{t h}$ percentiles. Standard errors are clustered by firm. With the cohort-year and cohort-firm fixed effects, we are using only the within firm variation in the existence of VC shareholders, that is, we are identifying the changes in CSR driven by the exit of VCs.  \n\n### 3.2. Baseline results  \n\nWe report the results in Table 3. We present the estimation results both with and without the control variables to mitigate the concern that some of these control variables may be endogenous. In Columns (1) and (2) for the aggregate CSR measure, the coefficient estimates on VC are negative and statistically significant, suggesting that VC involvement is negatively associated with CsR performance. Compared with the average CSR performance in our sample, the CSR scores of listed firms become $24\\%$ (1.074/4.47)higher after VCs exit the firms. We then present the results for the three subcomponents in Columns (3)-(8). Firms show a $10\\%$ $(0.23/2.30)$  \n\n![](images/b7e59ab66380456589f2047b5eab7f68254b89abbd9da5b6ab5578c43b9ea263.jpg)  \nPanel A: Firms without VC backing  \n\n![](images/84f51253a2d2e86edbfba3e7dff530dac303d405789170d390e2ad8525b39d7a.jpg)  \nPanel B: Firms with VC backing   \nFig.1.CSR dynamics. This figure plots the average CSR of firms without VC backing (Panel A) and firms with VC backing (Panel B).  \n\nhigher score of responsibility toward employees $(E R)$ ,a $39\\%$ (0.393/1.08) higher score of responsibility toward suppliers, consumers, and customers (SCCR), and $41\\%\\left(0.450/1.09\\right)$ higher score of responsibility toward the environment (EVR) after VCs exit the firms. The coefficient estimates with and without controls are very similar, suggesting that VCs’ exit decisions are not highly correlated with these firm characteristics.  \n\nLarge firms and profitable firms tend to have better CSR performance. Consistent with the findings in Dyck et al. (2019) and Chen et al. (2020), institutional ownership is positively associated with CsR performance. In particular, one concern of the baseline results is that when VCs exit their portfolio companies, other institutional investors fillin and then lead to better CSR performance. By including institutional ownership as a control variable, we mitigate that concern.  \n\nOverall, the results suggest that VC may pressure firms to maximize shareholder welfare at the expense of other stakeholders and  \n\nTable 3 VC and CSR.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>()</td><td>(8)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">CSR</td><td colspan=\"2\">ER</td><td colspan=\"2\">SCCR</td><td colspan=\"2\">EVR</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>-1.051*</td><td>1.074**</td><td>-0.216</td><td>-0.230*</td><td>-0.383*</td><td>-0.393*</td><td>-0.452*</td><td>-0.450**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.560)</td><td>(0.548)</td><td>(0.137)</td><td>(0.134)</td><td>(0.216)</td><td>(0.211)</td><td>(0.231)</td><td>(0.227)</td></tr><tr><td>Log Age</td><td></td><td>1.276</td><td></td><td>-0.830</td><td></td><td>0.007</td><td></td><td>-0.453</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(3.314)</td><td></td><td>(0.889)</td><td></td><td>(1.216)</td><td></td><td>(1.373)</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td></td><td>1.758**</td><td></td><td>0.507**</td><td></td><td>0.599**</td><td></td><td>0.652**</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.745)</td><td></td><td>(0.205)</td><td></td><td>(0.284)</td><td></td><td>(0.295)</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td></td><td>7.812</td><td></td><td>1.454</td><td></td><td>2.907</td><td></td><td>3.451</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(6.251)</td><td></td><td>(1.968)</td><td></td><td>(2.414)</td><td></td><td>(2.346)</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td></td><td>2.110</td><td></td><td>0.478</td><td></td><td>0.484</td><td></td><td>1.148</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(2.550)</td><td></td><td>(0.575)</td><td></td><td>(1.033)</td><td></td><td>(1.068)</td></tr><tr><td>Cash Holding</td><td></td><td>-2.003</td><td></td><td>-0.398</td><td></td><td>-0.586</td><td></td><td>1.019</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(1.636)</td><td></td><td>(0.442)</td><td></td><td>(0.649)</td><td></td><td>(0.636)</td></tr><tr><td>Dual</td><td></td><td>0.349</td><td></td><td>-0.040</td><td></td><td>0.254</td><td></td><td>0.135</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(0.656)</td><td></td><td>(0.162)</td><td></td><td>(0.260)</td><td></td><td>(0.266)</td></tr><tr><td>Big 4</td><td></td><td>1.432</td><td></td><td>0.292</td><td></td><td>0.903</td><td></td><td>0.821</td></tr><tr><td>Indep</td><td></td><td>(1.849)</td><td></td><td>(0.382)</td><td></td><td>(1.077)</td><td></td><td>(1.023)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>5.236</td><td></td><td>0.706</td><td></td><td>1.327</td><td></td><td>3.202</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(4.807)</td><td></td><td>(1.203)</td><td></td><td>(1.752)</td><td></td><td>(2.037)</td></tr><tr><td>Inst Own</td><td></td><td>0.057*</td><td></td><td>0.014</td><td></td><td>0.018</td><td></td><td>0.025**</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td></td><td>(0.031)</td><td></td><td>(0.009)</td><td></td><td>(0.013)</td><td></td><td>(0.011)</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R-squared</td><td>6313</td><td>6313</td><td>6313</td><td>6313</td><td>6313</td><td>6313</td><td>6313</td><td>6313</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.640</td><td>0.642</td><td>0.690</td><td>0.692</td><td>0.628</td><td>0.630</td><td>0.626</td><td>0.630</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort-YearFixed Effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort-Firm Fixed Effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table presents the baseline results on the effect of VC on the CSR performance of their portfolio companies from estimating $C S R_{i,t,c}=\\alpha_{i,c}+\\alpha_{t,c}+$ $\\beta V C_{i,t-1,c}+\\gamma X_{i,t-1,c}+\\varepsilon_{i,t,c}.$ The dependent variable CSR is the total CSR score.

This result is contrary to the effect of other institutional investors, which, as shown by Dyck et al. (2019) and Chen et al. (2020), are often associated with better CSR performance. The difference can be driven by either the different nature of VC or our focus on Chinese VCs.  \n\n### 3.3. The timing of the effect of VC exit  \n\nOne concern for the baseline specification above is that the results may be driven by endogenous VC exit decisions and the changing CSR performance of portfolio companies even before VC exit. As a first step to mitigate this concern, we examine the timing of the effect of VC exit on CSR performance. In particular, we first expand our stacked sample to include observations from $t-3$ to $t+3$ for cohort $t$ and then estimate the following,  \n\n$$\nC S R_{i,t,c}=\\alpha_{i,c}+\\alpha_{t,c}+\\sum_{\\tau=-2}^{3}\\beta_{\\tau}E x i t_{\\tau,c}+\\gamma X_{i,t-1,c}+\\varepsilon_{i,t,c},\n$$  \n\nwhere $E x i t_{\\tau}=1$ if the observation is in $\\tau$ years after ( $\\cdot-\\tau$ years before if $\\tau<0\\mathrm{.}$ ) VC exit; in particular, $E x i t_{0}=1$ if the observation is in the first year without VC; year $t-3$ is the benchmark year. Under this specification, $\\beta_{\\tau}$ s should be close to zero for all $\\tau<0$ if the baseline results are not driven by pre-existing trends.  \n\nWe estimate Eq. (2) for the total CSR score (CSR) and its subcomponents. We plot the coefficient estimates of $\\beta_{\\tau}$ sandtheirconfidence intervals, and the results are presented in Fig. 2. Panel A plots the coefficient estimates for the total CSR score. The coefficient estimates are all small and statistically insignificant for $\\tau\\leq0$ . In contrast, the coefficient estimates are greater and become statistically significant for $\\tau>0$ . We then focus on the coefficient estimates for ER, SCCR, and EVR in Panels B-D, which all show a similar pattern as in Panel A. These results suggest that CSR performance improves only after, but not before, VC exits and that the effects of VC exit on these CSR performance measures are unlikely to be driven by pre-existing trends.  \n\n### 3.4. Addressing endogeneity concerns  \n\nOur baseline results may be subject to endogeneity concerns. First, VC involvement and exit can be endogenous. For example, if VCs are more likely to exit through IPOs (instead of through mergers and acquisitions) from firms with worse CSR performance, public firms with VC backing are likely to perform worse in CSR. Although our method does not rely on this cross-sectional variation in VC backing, it remains a concern. Furthermore, VC exit decisions are certainly not random, and could be correlated with unobservable firm characteristics. In particular, VCs may stay in weaker firms longer and exit only when the firms can sustain themselves (Bottazzi et al., 2008), causing selection bias in generalized DID estimates. To ensure that the effect is causal and is driven by VC monitoring, we use an instrumental variable approach to isolate the exogenous variation in VC exit timing.  \n\n![](images/ef0a783dcbbaf9bc632045e6cdebeaac4c9a94e6b884ce43d553ee77d4e3ee0a.jpg)  \n\n![](images/21bf22cc7461f241bb2b4f4b5e8fb40e1dcfae5034be0f47560c31de2822a88d.jpg)  \n\n![](images/83126e1498ca045cc04dffe18af5a4331b396b3700edd905cd10078c8490d9fe.jpg)  \nPanel C: SCCR  \n\n![](images/59c793af331b36f3732431f0eb37799463adb313dda68a873307c44ce6d7acf8.jpg)  \nPanel D: EVR   \nFig. 2. The timing of the effect of VC exit on CSR performance. This figure plots the coefficient estimates of $\\beta_{\\tau}\\mathbf{s}$ and their $95\\%$ confidence intervals from estimating $\\begin{array}{r}{C S R_{i,t,c}=\\alpha_{i,c}+\\alpha_{t,c}+\\sum_{\\tau=-2}^{3}\\beta_{\\tau}E x i t_{\\tau,c}+\\gamma X_{i,t-1,c}+\\varepsilon_{i,t,c}}\\end{array}$ where $E x i t_{\\tau}=1$ if the observation is in $\\tau$ years after if the observation is in $\\tau$ years after $\\cdot-\\tau$ years before if $\\tau<0$ ); in particular, $E x i t_{0}=1$ if the observation is in the first year without VC.  \n\nSpecifically, we use the age of the VC funds to instrument for VC exit. Most VC funds are organized as limited partnerships and have a limited lifetime (typically 5-10 years). As such, VCs may be forced to exit their portfolio firms when they are getting close to the end of their lifetime. As such, the age of VC funds is likely to be correlated with VC exit decisions. For identification, we also need the exclusion condition, which requires that the VC fund age only affects CSR performance through its impact on VC exit timing. However, Barrot (2017) shows that the age of VC funds affects VCs' choice of investment projects. He shows that older VC funds are more likely to invest in mature firms. In this case, if mature firms also experience more improvement in CSR performance over time, the exclusion condition will be violated. To mitigate this concern, we first conduct several diagnostic tests. In particular, we examine whether fund age is associated with the CSR performance of portfolio companies before the exit of VCs. If VC fund age directly impacts the CSR performance, it should affect CSR performance before exit. On the other hand, if the VC fund age can only affect CSR performance through its impact on VC exit, it should have no effect on CSR performance before exit.  \n\nFirst, we try to examine whether the age of VC funds is correlated with the CSR of companies during the first reporting year after the IPO. We calculate the age of each VC fund as the current year minus the starting year of the fund. We choose to focus on the first reporting year after the IPO because we do not have CSR scores for private firms. We present the cross-sectional regression results in Panel A of Table 4. The results show that the VC fund age has no effect on the CSR performance of their portfolio companies at IPOs.  \n\nNext, we examine whether the VC fund age may affect the dynamics of the CSR of their portfolio companies after the IPO. For example, if older VC funds invest in mature firms and the CSR performance of mature firms may improve less than that of younger firms, then the age of VC funds can directly affect the dynamics of CsR. In this case, we first calculate the changes in CSR score during the first two years after the IPO, and then regress the changes in CSR on the age of the VC funds. The results are presented in Panel B of Table 4. Again, the age of VC funds has no effect on the changes in the CSR performance of their portfolio companies. The results in Table 4 therefore suggest that the age of VC funds is unlikely to directly affect the CSR performance of their portfolio companies. As such, the exclusion condition is likely to be satisfied.7  \n\nWe then proceed to conduct instrumental variable estimation. In particular, we use the natural logarithm of one plus the age of the VC fund as the instrument (Log_Fund_Age) and the two-stage least squares (2SLS) to estimate the instrumental variable specification, again on the stacked sample. The results are presented in Table 5. We show the first-stage regression results in Column (1). The coefficient estimate on the instrument, Log_Fund Age, is negative and statistically significant, suggesting that older VC funds are more likely to exit their portfolio firms. The F-statistic of the first stage regression is 45.23, suggesting that the instrument is strong. The second-stage regression results are presented in Columns (2)-(5). The IV coefficient estimates continue to be negative and statistically significant. In fact, the magnitudes of the IV estimates are greater than the OLS estimates in Table 3. VC involvement reduces the overall CSR score. For the subcomponents, VC involvement also reduces responsibility toward employees (ER), suppliers and customers (SCCR), and the environment (EVR).  \n\nWe hypothesize that VCs try to maximize shareholder value at the expense of other stakeholders. In this subsection, we examine whether VCs indeed improve shareholder value. To measure shareholder value, we first use the Hexun score on responsibility toward shareholders (SR). Responsibility toward shareholders is evaluated based on firm profitability (10 points), solvency (3 points), payout (8 points), penalties and enforcement actions issued by regulators (5 points), and innovation (4 points). The highest possible score for SR is 30 points. We also complement the shareholder responsibility score with the annual stock return (Return), return on assets (ROA, profit margin (Profit Margin), and payout ratio (Payout). Because VC exit decisions are likely to be affected by operating performance and stock returns, the OLS regression results can be severely biased by reverse causality. Therefore, we again use the age of VC funds as an instrument for VC exit timing, and present the second stage results in Table 6. The coefficient estimates on VC are all positive and two are statistically significant, suggesting that, to some extent, the presence of VC improves shareholder value. In particular, VCs are associated with a 2.6 percentage points higher stock return and 0.9 percentage points higher payout ratio. These results suggest that VCs may pressure their portfolio companies to minimize cost and to pay out more to shareholders, which then causes the firms to underinvest in CsR.  \n\n## 4. VC heterogeneity  \n\nVCs may differ in ownership structure, investment experience, profitability, and authority in portfolio companies. The heteroge. neity of VCs may affect VCs' incentives, and hence their impact on their portfolio companies. In this section, we explore the crosssectional heterogeneity of the impact of VC on the CSR performance of their portfolio companies.  \n\nTable4 The age of VC fund as an instrument: diagnostic tests.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Panel A: VC fund age and CSR at IPO</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td></td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CSR</td><td>ER</td><td>SCCR</td><td></td><td>EVR</td></tr><tr><td>Fund Age</td><td>0.054</td><td>-0.021</td><td>-0.012</td><td></td><td>-0.021</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>(0.051)</td><td>(0.018)</td><td>(0.017) 474</td><td></td><td>(0.021)</td></tr><tr><td>AdjustedR-squared</td><td>474</td><td>474</td><td></td><td></td><td>474</td></tr><tr><td>Control Variables</td><td>0.009</td><td>0.007</td><td></td><td>0.014 Yes</td><td>0.018</td></tr><tr><td>Year Fixed Effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td><td>Yes Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"></td></tr><tr><td>Panel B: VC fund age and changes in CSR after IPO</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td></td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Change in CSR</td><td>Change in ER</td><td></td><td>Change inSCCR</td><td>Change in EVR</td></tr><tr><td>Fund Age</td><td></td><td>0.026</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.060 (0.073)</td><td>(0.022)</td><td>0.032</td><td></td><td>0.003 (0.020)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>473</td><td>473</td><td>(0.036) 473</td><td></td><td>473</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R-squared</td><td>0.021</td><td>0.020</td><td>0.021</td><td></td><td>0.022</td></tr><tr><td>ControlVariables</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Year Fixed Effects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td>Yes</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table presents the results of two diagnostic tests regarding the use of VC fund age as an instrumental variable for VC exit.

The dependent variable CSR is the overall corporate social responsibility score. The subcomponents of CSR are responsibility toward employees $(E R)$ , responsibility toward suppliers, consumers and customers (SCCR), and responsibility toward the environment (EVR). The instrumental variable, Log Fund Age, is the natural logarithm of one plus the age of the youngest VC fund ever involved in the firm. VC equals one if VCs hold shares of the firm, and zero otherwise. Variable definitions are presented in Appendix A.

VCs on the board  \n\nThe extent to which VCs can effectively monitor their portfolio companies may depend on whether VCs sit on the board of directors. Holding directorships in portfolio firms can give VCs more power and convenience to actively pursue their own interests in the portfolio companies. In our sample, about $79.71\\%$ of VCs hold the directorship position in their portfolio companies. These VCs are not only skilled in capital management but are also experts in corporate operations and entrepreneurship in certain areas. They help portfolio companies recruit and monitor key managers, work with suppliers and consumers, become involved in tactics and strategy establishment, raise capital, and help with M&As. In some cases, they can appoint key members of the top management team to gain direct control or take over day-to-day business and operations, both before and after going public (Barry et al., 1990; Sahlman, 1990; Lerner, 1995; Hellmann and Puri, 2002).  \n\nAs such, we expect that the effect of VC on CsR will be stronger when VCs are on the board of directors and are more able to monitor their portfolio companies. To see if that is the case, we estimate the following,  \n\nTable 6 VC and shareholder value.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">VC</td><td>SR</td><td>Return</td><td>ROA</td><td>Profitmargin</td><td>Payoutratio</td></tr><tr><td>4.155</td><td>2.592**</td><td>0.024</td><td>8.118</td><td>0.903*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Observations</td><td>(3.128)</td><td>(1.223)</td><td>(0.025)</td><td>(14.241)</td><td>(0.539)</td></tr><tr><td>5954</td><td>5723</td><td>5954</td><td>5667</td><td>5954</td></tr><tr><td>R-squared</td><td>0.142</td><td>-0.228</td><td>-0.089</td><td>-0.062</td><td>0.127</td></tr><tr><td>ControlVariables</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort-YearFixedEffects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort-FirmFixedEffects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThis table presents 2SLS regression estimations of the effect of VC on shareholder value. The dependent variables are SR, the responsibility toward shareholder score, Return, annual stock return, ROA, return on assets, Profit Margin, the profit margin, and Payout, the payout ratio. The instrumental variable, Log Fund Age, is the natural logarithm of one plus the age of the youngest VC fund ever involved in the firm. $V C$ equals oneif VCs hold shares of the firm, and zero otherwise. Variable definitions are presented in Appendix A. All continuous variables are winsorized at the $1^{s t}$ and $99^{t h}$ percentiles. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level.

(3) using the stacked sample. The coefficient estimates on VC Board are all negative and statistically significant. In contrast, the coefficients on VC_Other are all much smaller and statistically insignificant. These results suggest that the baseline results are driven by VCs on the board of directors, who can better monitor their portfolio companies.  \n\n### 4.2. VC experience  \n\nNext, we examine whether VC experience changes the effect of VC monitoring on CSR performance. To this end, we follow the literature to measure VC experience using several different measures (Lerner, 1994; Gompers, 1996; Nahata, 2008; and Chemmanur et al., 2011). In particular, using data from Zero2IPO, we calculate the total number of historical investment rounds made by the VC (VC Rounds), the number of firms brought to the IPO by the VC (VC IPO), and total investment by the VC divided by the total investments by all VCs (VC_Share) to measure VC experience, performance, and reputation.° We calculate these measures at the start of our sample period (2010) and we then define two dummy variables, High and Low. High equals one if the measures of the VCs involved in the firm are above the sample median and zero otherwise; Low equals one if the measures of the VCs involved in the firm are below the sample median and zero otherwise; and High and Low both equal zero if all vCs have exited from the firm. We then estimate the following,  \n\n$$\nC S R_{i,t,c}=\\alpha_{i,c}+\\alpha_{t,c}+\\beta_{1}H i g h_{i,t-1,c}+\\beta_{2}L o w_{i,t-1,c}+\\gamma X_{i,t-1,c}+\\varepsilon_{i,t,c}.\n$$  \n\nThe results are presented in Table 8. In Panel A, the two dummy variables, High and Low are defined based on whether the total number of investment rounds by the VC is above or below the sample median. The coefficient estimates on High are all small or statistically insignificant. In contrast, the coefficient estimates on Low are similar to those coefficients on VC in Table 3, suggesting that the baseline results are mostly driven by relatively inexperienced VCs.  \n\nIn Panel B, the two dummy variables are defined based on the number of firms brought to IPO by the VC. The pattern is similar to Panel A. The coefficient estimates on High are small or statistically insignificant, except for responsibility toward employees (ER). The coefficient estimates on Low are again similar to those in Table 3, suggesting that the baseline results are mostly driven by poorly performingVCs.  \n\nFinally in Panel C, we define the two dummy variables based on total investment by the VC scaled by the total investment by all VCs, the VC reputation measure as in Nahata (2008). In this case, the coefficient estimates on High and Low are again similar to those in Panels A and B. Overall, the results in Table 8 suggest that the negative effect of VC on CSR performance is driven mostly by inexperiencedvCs.  \n\n### 4.3. VC types  \n\nNext, we examine whether the different types of sponsors of VCs impact their portfolio companies? CSR performance differently. In particular, we categorize VCs into three categories, sponsored by a domestic private institution (PvC), sponsored by local governments (GVC), and sponsored by a foreign institution (FVC). Distinguished between domestic and foreign VCs could help answer the following question: Whether the effect is mostly driven by foreign VCc who would have less or no interest in the social welfare.

The dependent variable CSR is the overall corporate social responsibility score. The subcomponents of CSR are responsibility toward employees (ER), responsibility toward suppliers, consumers and customers (SCCR), and responsibility toward the environment (EVR). VC_Board equals one if VCs sit on the board of directors, and zero otherwise. VC_Other equals one if VCs hold other positions or no positions, and zero otherwise.

Significance at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ levels is indicated by $\\cdots\\ast\\ast$ and $^*$ , respectively.  \n\nbetween private and government sponsored VCs could help us better understand the incentives of the VCs. In particular, we expect government sponsored VCs to have a positive or a less negative impact on CsR because governments should care more about social Welfare.  \n\nWe then estimate the following,  \n\n$$\nC S R_{i,t,c}=\\alpha_{i,c}+\\alpha_{t,c}+\\beta_{1}P V C_{i,t-1,c}+\\beta_{2}G V C_{i,t-1,c}+\\beta_{3}F V C_{i,t-1,c}+\\gamma X_{i,t-1,c}+\\varepsilon_{i,t,c},\n$$  \n\nThe results are presented in Table 9. The coefficient estimates on PVC and $G V C$ are qualitatively similar to the coeficient estimates On $V C$ in Table 3. In contrast, all the coefficient estimates on FVC have the opposite signs, suggesting that the baseline results are driven entirely by domestic VCs, and that foreign VCs do not have a negative impact on portfolio firms' CSR performance. Furthermore, interestingly, government-backed VCs reduce their portfolio companies’ CSR performance. These results suggest that Chinese domestic VCc, especially those sponsored by local governments, are more likely to pursue short-term monetary returns at the expense of social Welfare.  \n\n## 5. Additional results  \n\n### 5.1. VC shareholding  \n\nIn the analysis, we examine the effect of VC using the dummy variable of whether a VC holds shares of the company. In this subsection, we instead examine the effect of VCs? shareholding. In particular, we calculate the percentage of firm shares owned by VCs as VC_Share and estimate the following,  \n\n$$\nC S R_{i,t,c}=\\alpha_{i,c}+\\alpha_{t,c}+\\beta V C\\_S h a r e_{i,t-1,c}+\\gamma X_{i,t-1,c}+\\varepsilon_{i,t,c},\n$$  \n\nThe results are presented in Table 10. Similar to our baseline results, the coefficient estimates on VC_share are all negative and statistically significant.  \n\n### 5.2. VC firm fixed effects  \n\nOne VC firm often has multiple VC funds with different expiration times. The VC firm can therefore choose a particular fund to invest or divest from certain types of projects, which could introduce selection bias to our estimates. To mitigate this concern, we include VC firm fixed effects to our baseline specification for firms with VC backing. The results are presented in Table 11. The coefficient estimates on VC are again all negative and three of them are statistically significant. The reduced statistical significance is likely to be driven by the the large number of fixed effects. These results suggest that the effect of VC on CSR is unlikely to be driven by VCfirmselectionissues.  \n\n### 5.3. CSR reports  \n\nHexun rates firms' CSR performance based on information from CSR reports and annual reports. In addition to firms listed on the \"Corporate Governance Sector' of the SHSE and those in the “Shenzhen ${}^{100^{\\mathrm{*}}}$ index that are required to publish CSR reports, some firms also voluntarily issue CSR reports. Because CSR reports are likely to contain more detailed information regarding firms' CSR performance, the ratings based only on annual reports and those based on both annual reports and CSR reports may be different. To mitigate this concern, we include a dummy variable, CSR Report, which equals one if the firm publishes a CSR report in that year, to our  \n\nTable8 VC reputation and CSR performance.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"5\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4) EVR</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>0.077</td><td>-0.046</td><td>0.139</td><td>-0.016</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.728)</td><td>(0.169)</td><td>(0.309)</td><td>(0.284)</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>-1.451*</td><td>-0.269</td><td>-0.612**</td><td>-0.569*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(0.761)</td><td>(0.178)</td><td>(0.293)</td><td>(0.317)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>6212</td><td>6212</td><td>6212</td><td>6212</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R-squared</td><td>0.634</td><td>0.688</td><td>0.622</td><td>0.620</td></tr><tr><td>ControlVariables</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort-YearFixedEffects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort-FirmFixedEffects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel A: The number of investment rounds   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td>CSR</td><td>ER</td><td>SCCR</td><td>EVR</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">High</td><td>0.046</td><td>-0.079</td><td>0.137</td><td>0.012</td></tr><tr><td>(0.791)</td><td>(0.186)</td><td>(0.317)</td><td>(0.319)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Low</td><td>-1.578**</td><td>-0.254*</td><td>-0.691**</td><td>-0.633**</td></tr><tr><td>(0.660)</td><td>(0.149)</td><td>(0.269)</td><td>(0.272)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>6212</td><td>6212</td><td>6212</td><td>6212</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted R-squared</td><td>0.634</td><td>0.688</td><td>0.622</td><td>0.620</td></tr><tr><td>ControlVariables</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort-YearFixedEffects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort-FirmFixedEffects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nPanel B: The number of firms brought to IPO   \nPanel C: The shares of total investment   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CSR</td><td>ER</td><td>SCCR</td><td>EVR</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">High</td><td>0.028</td><td>-0.067</td><td>0.126</td><td>-0.031</td></tr><tr><td>(0.721)</td><td>(0.168)</td><td>(0.306)</td><td>(0.282)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Low</td><td>-1.435*</td><td>-0.253</td><td>-0.616**</td><td>-0.566*</td></tr><tr><td>(0.768)</td><td>(0.179)</td><td>(0.295)</td><td>(0.320)</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>6212</td><td>6212</td><td>6212</td><td>6212</td></tr><tr><td>AdjustedR-squared</td><td>0.634</td><td>0.688</td><td>0.622</td><td>0.620</td></tr><tr><td>ControlVariables</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort-YearFixedEffects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort-FirmFixedEffects</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe table presents the results on the effect of VCs with different experience, performance, and reputation levels on portfolio firms' CSR performance. We use the total number of historical investment rounds made by the VC (VC_Rounds), the number of firms brought to the IPO by the VC (VC_IPO), and total investment of the VC divided by total investments by all VCs (VC Share) to measure VC experience, performance, and reputation. We calculate these measures at the start of the sample period (2010) and we then define two dummy variables, High and Low. High equals one if the measures are above the sample median and zero otherwise; Low equals one if the measures are below the sample median and zero otherwise; and High and Low both equal to zero if the firm has no VCs involved. The dependent variable CSR is the overall corporate social responsibility score. The subcomponents of CSR are responsibility toward employees $(E R)$ , responsibility toward suppliers, consumers and customers (SCCR), and responsibility toward the environment (EVR).

Nonetheless, the coefficient estimates on VC remain negative. The decline in statistical significance is likely driven by the dramatic decreases in sample size.  \n\n### 5.5. Adjusted CSR measures  \n\nOne concern is that all our CSR scores, similar to the MSCI KLD measure, are rescaled every year. In this subsection, we therefore follow the CsR literature to scale the raw measures by the difference between the maximum scores and the minimum scores of the year. We then replace the dependent variables in Eq. (1) with these adjusted CSR measures. The results, as presented in Panel A of Table 14. are qualitatively similar to those in Table 3.  \n\nAs described earlier, Hexun also assigns different weights of the subcomponents to different industries. To ensure that our results are not driven by the different weights, we readjust the weight to be the same across allindustries. The results with these adjusted ratings are presented in Panel B, and are similar to the results based on unadjusted ratings.  \n\n### 5.6. RKS CSR measures  \n\nAlthough we argue that the Hexun.com rating provides the most accurate and comprehensive coverage, we want to show that our results are robust using other measures. In this section, we examine whether our results hold using the RKS rating. Different from Hexun.com, the RKS rating relies exclusively on the CSR reports firms issued by the firms, and hence the coverage is much smaller. The RKS rating also has four subcomponents, namely, the macrosom (M), content (C), technology $(T)$ andindustry $(I)$ .Wepresentthe results using the RKS rating in Table 15. Similar to the results in Table 3, the coeficient estimates on VC are all negative and mostly statistically significant, suggesting that our baseline results are robust to alternative CSR ratings.  \n\n## 6.

Using the age of VC funds as an instrument for VC exit decisions, we find that the negative effect of VC on CSR performance is likely to be causal. We also find that the negative effect of VC on CSR performance is mostly driven by VCs on the board of directors, relatively inexperienced, bad performing, and less reputable VCs.  \n\nOur results are different from those in the existing literature, most of which documents that institutional investors lead to better CSR performance of their portfolio companies (e.g. Dyck et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020), suggesting that VCs may have different incentives than other types of institutional investors. We also acknowledge that our results may not generalizable to other countries, therefore, our paper calls for more research in understanding more generally how VCs may impact social welfare.  \n\nTable15 Robustness with RKS CSR ratings.   \nAppendix A: Variable definitions.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td>Definition</td><td>Source</td></tr><tr><td>CSR</td><td>Theoverallcorporatesocialresponsibilityscore</td><td>hexun.com</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(continuedonnextpage)</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n(continued)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variables</td><td>Definition</td><td>Source</td></tr><tr><td>SR</td><td>Responsibility toward shareholders</td><td>hexun.com</td></tr><tr><td>ER</td><td>Responsibility toward employees</td><td>hexun.com</td></tr><tr><td>SCCR</td><td>Responsibility toward suppliers,consumers and customers</td><td>hexun.com</td></tr><tr><td>EVR</td><td>Responsibilitytowardtheenvironment</td><td>hexun.com</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>Adummyvariable;equals1ifVCinvolves,and0otherwise</td><td>Zero2IPO</td></tr><tr><td>PVC</td><td>A dummy variable; equals1if domestic privateVCinvolves,and 0 otherwise</td><td>Zero2IPO</td></tr><tr><td>GVC</td><td>A dummy variable;equals1if government VC involves,and 0 otherwise</td><td>Zero2IPO</td></tr><tr><td>FVC</td><td>A dummy variable; equals 1 if foreign VC involves, and 0 otherwise</td><td>Zero2IPO</td></tr><tr><td>VC_Board</td><td>A dummy variable equals 1 if a firm has at least one VC director, and0otherwise</td><td>Hand-collected</td></tr><tr><td>VC_Share</td><td>Percentage ofVCshareholdings</td><td>Hand-Collected</td></tr><tr><td>Log Fund_Age</td><td>Thenatural logarithm of the number of years since thefirmwasfounded</td><td>CSMRA</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>The natural logarithm of the total assets of thefirm at theend of theyear</td><td>CSMRA</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>The return on assets, net income divided by total assets</td><td>CSMRA</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>Thebookvalue ofleverage scaledby total assets</td><td>CSMRA</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>cashandcashequivalencescaledbytotalassets</td><td>CSMRA</td></tr><tr><td>InstOwn</td><td>Thepercentage of ownershipby institutionalinvestors other thanVC</td><td>CSMRA</td></tr><tr><td>Dual</td><td>A dummy variable; equals 1 if the CEO is also the chairman of the board, and0otherwise</td><td>CSMRA</td></tr><tr><td>Big4</td><td></td><td>CSMRA</td></tr><tr><td>Indep</td><td>The proportion of independent directors on the board of directors</td><td>CSMRA</td></tr><tr><td>RKS CSR</td><td>The overall RKS corporate social responsibility score</td><td>RKS</td></tr><tr><td>M</td><td>TheRKS macrosom score</td><td>RKS</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>TheRKS content score</td><td>RKS</td></tr><tr><td>T</td><td>TheRKS technology score</td><td>RKS</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The RKS industry score</td><td>RKS</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n![](images/28c01b29c0a4c3eaa47ab0ae277553c0864682f8c502dcc5a85fda690a542a56.jpg)  \nPanel A: ROA   \nPanel B: ROE   \nAppendix B: Hexun scores.  \n\nThis appendix plots the relationship between the rankings of the original variable and the scores provided by Hexun in 2015.

In this respect, venture capital (VC) is considered by both academics and practitioners as one of the key drivers of the success of  entrepreneurial firms.  Several previous  firm-level  studies  investigated the relationship between VC funding and firm performance. On average, they show that VC-backed firms grow faster, patent more, have higher productivity and are more likely to go public than non-VC-backed ones (Wright and Robbie, 1998).  \n\nHowever, the causality of the impact of VC on firm performance is still a pending research question (Gompers and Lerner, 2001). In other words, the higher performance of VC-backed firms (compared to non-VC-backed ones) might be (at least partially) explained by the 'screening' ability of VC investors. Moreover, even though screening is controlled for, it is important to understand how VC investors foster the performance of portfolio firms: is the higher performance of VC-backed firms related to the VC funding received or to value-adding activities performed by VC investors? Finally, in the case of a significant 'value-adding effect' on portfolio firms' performance, it is interesting to test whether this effect persists over time or fades away after a few years.  \n\nIn this work we aim to fill these gaps. First, to tackle reverse causality problems between VC and firm performance, we perform a matching procedure before the first round of VC funding and we estimate the impact of VC both before and after the first round of VC funding. Second, in order to isolate the 'value-adding effect' from the financial effect', we use different productivity growth measures as dependent variables. In fact, by scaling sales growth with the necessary growth in inputs, productivity measures allow us to control for VC funding injections that increase firms’ inputs (capital and/or labor). Third, we test whether a value-adding effect exists and, if so, we verify whether VC investors are able to 'imprint' porfolio firms during their holding period. Finally, we test whether the value-adding effect is decreasing over time.  \n\nIn the empirical section of the paper, we consider a sample of 696 entrepreneurial firms, 267 of which are VC-backed. They are located in six European countries: Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. This sample is extracted from the VICO dataset, a brand new firm-level longitudinal dataset sponsored by the European Union under the $7^{\\circ}$ Framework Program (for more details, see the official website at: http://www.vicoproject.org). For more details on the procedures used in the data gathering process and on all of the variables included in the dataset, see Bertoni and Marti (2011).  \n\nThe econometric estimates show that VC-backed firms do not exhibit a significantly different productivity growth than that of their matched non-VC-backed counterparts before the first VC round, thus excluding a screening effect. This is not in line with some previous studies, mostly based on US manufacturing firms. This difference in screening abilities between US and European VC investors might be explained by the higher level of development of US VC market (than that of the European VC market). These results hold when we control for: i) the 'potentially different' growth orientation between VC-backed and matched non-VC-backed firms before VC funding; and i) the reputation of VC investors. Conversely, productivity growth is significantly higher in VC-backed firms after the first VC round, so confirming a value-adding effect. Moreover, VC-backed firms do not exhibit a decrease in productivity growth measures after the exit of VC investors, suggesting an imprinting effect. Finally, the effect of VC seems to be persistent over time. Our findings are robust, as confirmed by a series of different robustness checks we ran.  \n\nTo sum up, this study considerably extends our understanding of the impact of VC on the performance of European entrepreneurial firms in high-tech industries. From a policy perspective, this study reveals that VC is a valid tool for improving the performance of European entrepreneurial firms and indirectly to increase the dynamic efficiency of the economic system. Since the business environment in Europe makes it difficult for VC investors to successfully develop and exit entrepreneurial firms, incentive schemes should be further developed to enhance this type of investment.  \n\n# The Impact of Venture Capital on the Productivity  \n\nGrowth of European Entrepreneurial Firms:  \n\nScreening' or 'Value added' Effect?  \n\n## Abstract  \n\nWe aim to ascertain to what extent the better performance of European venture capital (VC)- backed firms in high-tech industries is due to either éscreening’ or 'value added' provided by VC investors. We compare portfolio firms? productivity growth before and after the first VC round, using a matched control group as benchmark. We show that productivity growth is not significantly different between VC and non-VC-backed firms before the first round of VC financing, whereas significant differences are found in the first years after the investment event. We also find that the value-adding services provided by VC investors 'imprint' the portfolio firm.  \n\n# 1. Introduction  \n\nVenture capital (VC, henceforth) is generally considered by both academics and practitioners as the most suitable financing mode for entrepreneurial firms. The extant literature has shown how VC investors (VCs, henceforth) play a key role in the screening process (Amit et al., 1998; Chan, 1983; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984), as well as in the post-investment monitoring of the portfolio firm (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2003; Lerner, 1995; Sahlman, 1990). VCs provide value-adding services (Sapienza et al., 1996; Sorensen, 2007), such as coaching, mentoring and access to investment bankers, which could have signaling effects (Megginson and Weiss, 1991). Furthermore, VCbacked firms benefit from the network of contacts that may be provided by reputable, well-connected VCs (Hsu, 2006; Lindsey, 2008).  \n\nSeveral previous studies evaluated the impact of VC on firm performance. In particular, some studies focused on different measures of firm growth, such as sales and employment growth (e.g. Alemany and Marti, 2005; Bottazzi and Da Rin, 2002; Bottazzi et al., 2008; Davila et al., 2003; Gompers and Lerner, 2001). Regarding productivity measures, Alemany and Marti (2006) used measures of partial productivity (i.e. capital and labor productivities), whereas Chemmanur et al. (2011) and Colombo et al. (2012) resorted to total factor productivity (TFP, henceforth).  \n\nHowever, as highlighted by Gompers and Lerner (2001), one of the pending research questions is the causality of the impact of VC on portfolio firm performance. In fact, the higher performance found in VC-backed firms is related to the presence of VCs in portfolio firm's equity capital, but it might also be explained by the attractiveness of firms with greater business opportunities. In other words, VC-backed firms might be better than non-VC-backed ones before the first round of VC financing. If this is true, then the higher performance of VC-backed firms can be (at least partially) explained by the 'screening' ability of VCs.  \n\nIn addition, even though screening is controlled for, there could still be some doubts about how VCs foster the performance of portfolio firms. VCs not only provide financial resources but also contribute to enhancing firm performance through valueadding activities. Since the superior performance of VC-backed firms might be solely related to the funding received, which is not easily available to similar firms without VC backing, it is important to isolate these two (financial' and 'value added') effects. Balboa et al. (2011) address this gap but they neglect to consider screening in their approach.  \n\nFurthermore, in the case of a significant value-adding effect on portfolio firms' performance, it is relevant to analyze whether this effect persists over time or fades away after a few years.  \n\nIn this work we aim to fill these gaps. First, to tackle the abovementioned reverse causality problems, we propose a procedure that allows us to: i) reduce the selection bias problem in our sample by applying a matching procedure before the first round of VC funding; i) control for reverse causality concerns by estimating the impact of VC both before and after the first round of VC funding. Secondly, in order to isolate the value-adding effect from the financial effect, we focus on productivity growth. In fact, by scaling sales growth with the necessary growth in inputs, productivity measures allow us to control for VC funding injections that increase firms’ inputs (capital and/on labor). It is worth noting that considering only output indicators (e.g. growth in sales or employees) without any regard for the cost-side would give us only a partial and incomplete indication of firm performance, and this could lead to wrong conclusions about the net benefits due to VC involvement. As productivity reflects both output performance and efficiency in the use of inputs, it is tailored to measure the impact of  \n\nVC financing that may have beneficial effects on both sides. In this study, we employ the growth in labor productivity, capital productivity and TFP as performance measures. Third, we test for the existence of a value-adding effect by VCs in porfolio firms and examine different characteristics of such value-adding activities. Primarily, we study whether VC involvement significantly leads to an increase in firm performance. Then we verify whether VCs are able to 'imprint' portfolio firms during their holding period. If they do, such 'imprinting' effect would continue to operate and benefit the portfolio firm, even after the exit of VCs. Finally, we test whether the impact of the value added provided by VCs on firm performance is decreasing over time. In particular, we argue that value-adding services provided by VCs should determine an increase in firm performance especially in the first years after VCs' entry into portfolio firms' equity capital.  \n\nOur sample includes 696 entrepreneurial firms, 267 of which are VC-backed. They received their first round of VC funding between 1995 and 2004. Sample firms are located in six European countries, namely Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.  \n\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the development of our research hypotheses. Section 3 describes the methodology applied to test our hypotheses. Section 4 describes the dataset and the sampling process and shows descriptive statistics on the sample used. Results are reported in Section 5. Section 6 shows further analyses we conducted to test the robustness of our findings. Finally, Section 7 discusses and concludes.  \n\n# 2. Theory and research hypotheses  \n\nEntrepreneurial firms may lack commercial and managerial competences (Teece, 1986) which limit their growth and even threaten their survival (Carpenter and Petersen, 2002a), especially when they operate in high-tech industries (Gans and Stern, 2003). Because of the technology-intensive nature of their activity, their lack of a track record and the nature of their assets (which are firm-specific and/or intangible and hence cannot be pledged as collateral), they face severe adverse selection and moral hazard problems in raising external capital (Berger and Udell, 1998; Bertoni et al., 2010; Carpenter and Petersen, 2002b; Denis, 2004).  \n\nVC financing is generally considered by both academics and practitioners as the most suitable financing mode for entrepreneurial firms, especially in the earlier stages of their life. Allegedly, VCs are able to 'pick winning firms′ that have promising future business opportunities, which are hidden to other investors, and provide them with the financing necessary to realize these opportunities (Amit et al., 1998; Chan, 1983; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984). However, they also “build winners? by providing portfolio firms with coaching (Hellmann and Puri, 2002; Jain and Kini, 1995), effective monitoring (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2003; Lerner, 1995; Sahlman, 1990) and valuable business contacts (Hsu, 2006; Lindsey, 2008).  \n\nThere is a vast theoretical and empirical literature about the impact of VC on firm performance. Firm-level studies targeting European countries have considered different measures of firm performance. On average, they show that VC-backed firms grow faster, patent more, have higher productivity and are more likely to go public than nonVC-backed ones (e.g. Wright and Robbie, 1998).  \n\nIn particular, in this work we focus on the impact of VCs on portfolio firm performance by considering that, in addition to funding, the positive effect might be explained by two different factors: i) screening; and i) value added.  \n\n## 2.1 Screening  \n\nVCs do not invest randomly; rather they select firms by continuously screening the market in order to find good investment opportunities (e.g. Chan, 1983; Muzyka et al., 1996). As a result, the superior performance of VC-backed firms might be related to the fact that VCs are able to select higher quality firms (Gompers and Lerner, 2001). In fact, VCs are recognized as agents that are better able to address information asymmetry problems than other financial intermediaries, especially when investing in unlisted firms (Amit et al., 1998). As a consequence, VCs’ screening ability could be a significant determinant of the superior performance of VC-backed firms (see, among others, Shepherd and Zacharakis, 2002; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984).2  \n\nNevertheless, it is important to consider that VC can also be a signal of high risk investments. Thus, if compared to alternative investments, VC financing may lead to a higher percentage of failures (Gifford, 1997). This survivorship bias may limit the validity of the previous works that looked at surviving VC-backed firms only.  \n\nAccordingly, the question to be answered is: Do portfolio firms perform better because of screening activities performed by VCs?  \n\nPrevious studies, reported in Table 1, provided mixed results on this issue.  \n\n# [Table 1]  \n\nBaum and Silverman (2004) focus on three initial start-up characteristics, namely social capital (alliances), intellectual capital (patents) and human capital (management), and analyze if these have the same influence on the financing decision of the VCs and the post-investment performance of portfolio firms. They suggest that VC-backed startups outperform non-VC-backed ones, but conclude that the question of causality remains unsolved. Chemmanur et al. (2011) find that the efficiency of VC-backed firms, before the first VC round, is higher than that of non- VC-backed counterparts. Furthermore, the growth in efficiency of VC-backed firms after the first VC round is higher than that of non- VC-backed firms.  \n\nOn the other hand, Davila et al. (2003) show that VC-backed firms grow more than their counterfactual after the initial VC round, but firm growth before VC funding does not attract VC investments. Bertoni et al. (2011) find strong evidence of a significantly higher growth of VC-backed firms, especially on employment. Conversely, they find weak evidence that firm growth before the first VC round leads to a greater likelihood of obtaining access to VC financing. Similar results are obtained by Engel (2002) on a sample of German firms, Balboa et al. (2006) on a sample of Spanish firms, and Colombo and Grilli (2010) on a sample of Italian firms. None of them find any evidence of a positive screening effect.  \n\nTo sum up, there is mixed evidence on the better performance of VC-backed firms before the first VC round. Nevertheless, based on the predictions of the literature about the superior screening abilities of VCs, we posit the following hypothesis.  \n\nHypothesis 1: the productivity growth of VC-backed firms is significantly higher than that of non-VC-backed ones before the first VC round.  \n\n## 2.2. Value added  \n\nAccording to the agency costs theory (Jensen and Meckling, 1976), a close supervision (i.e. monitoring) of portfolio firms after the investment event (Admati and Pfleiderer, 1994; Lerner, 1995) helps VC managers in: i) detecting potential problems (Mitchell et al., 1997); i) reducing agency costs; and i) increasing portfolio firm performance.  \n\nBut agency costs theory neglects to consider that VCs perform a key coaching function (Colombo and Grilli, 2010), largely beyond pure monitoring. VC involvement allows the portfolio firm to increase the bundle of resources (Barney, 1991) it already had, including both financial (Hellman and Puri, 2002) and managerial resources (Sorensen, 2007). During the holding period VCs provide help in defining strategic planning, assistance in management recruitment and compensation, access to their network of contacts (i.e. banks, suppliers and customers) and expertise in operational planning (Gompers and Lerner, 1998; Gorman and Sahlman, 1989; Sahlman, 1990; Sapienza et al., 1996; Sorensen, 2007), all of which become valuable resources for the portfolio firm (Shepherd et al., 2000). Such value-adding services are especially desirable in: i) early stage firms (Aspelund et al., 2005; Gerstein and Reisman, 1983); and i) high-tech industries (Colombo and Grilli, 2005).  \n\nHence, the resource-based view adds to the agency perspective by recognizing that access to resources and capabilities is an important driver of firm performance (Ireland et al., 2003). This complementary approach of agency costs theory and resource-based view is not new in the VC/private equity literature (Meuleman et al., 2009).  \n\nAfter accounting for the effect of funding, VC involvement should lead to an increase in firm performance grounded on better resources (i.e. value-adding services)  \n\nand monitoring (e.g. incentives to portfolio firm's managers). Therefore, we posit the following hypothesis.  \n\nHypothesis 2: the productivity growth of VC-backed firms is significantly higher than that of non-VC-backed ones in the holding period.  \n\nAs suggested by Bamford et al. (1999) and Boeker (1989), early decisions and founding conditions ‘imprint? the firm's future evolution. In these initial stages, entrepreneurs adopt an initial strategy based on the resources they have at hand and those they can realistically acquire (Dollinger, 1995). Since VC involvement implies a sort of firm re-birth', the resources provided by VCs contribute to the existing bundle of resources and help entrepreneurs in defining a new firm strategic behavior with longlasting effects. Consequently, we expect that the 'imprinting' exerted by VCs during the holding period will continue to operate and benefit the portfolio firm, even after VCs' exit. The basic argument is that VCs' capabilities indelibly influence the organization and all sort of operations. In so doing the ways they organize things become routines that will continue to be active and effective even after their eventual departure (Barringer et al., 2005; Boeker, 1988, 1989; Heirman and Clarysse, 2005; Packalen, 2007; Stinchcombe, 1965).  \n\nIn particular we assume that, once the impact of VCs' involvement (which moves the portfolio firm's productivity towards higher levels than before VCs' entry) is absorbed, portfolio firms do not decrease their performance (i.e. productivity growth). Therefore, we posit the following hypothesis.  \n\nHypothesis 3: the productivity growth of VC-backed firms is not expected to decrease after VCs' exit.  \n\nThen, we go a step beyond in analyzing the characteristics of value added provided by VCs. In fact, the intensity of the effect of VC on firm performance might be different according to the different time elapsed from the first VC round. We argue that the value-adding services provided by VCs should determine an increase in firm performance especially in the first years after VCs' entry. Milanov and Fernhaber (2009) affirm that the most sensitive years are the first three years since the firm is established. Since we assume that the entry of a VC investor will imply a sort of re-birth of the portfolio firm, the most significant effect should be found in the first two years following the year of the first VC round, i.e. three years from the portfolio firm's rebirth (Bertoni et al., 2011),. Therefore, we posit the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 4: the productivity growth of VC-backed firms is significantly higher than that of the non-VC-backed ones in the first two years after the first VC round.  \n\n# 3. Methodology  \n\n## 3.1. The empirical models  \n\nWe use the following model to test our first three hypotheses (H1, H2 and H3, hereafter):  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{P r o d\\_g r o w t h_{i t}=\\alpha_{0}+\\mu_{i}+\\beta x_{\\bar{\\varepsilon},\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}}+\\gamma_{\\bar{\\ p}r e}V C_{i,\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}}^{\\bar{\\ p}r e}+\\gamma_{i n}V C_{i,\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}}^{i n}+\\gamma_{\\alpha\\bar{f}\\bar{\\varepsilon}\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}\\bar{\\mathbf{e}}r}V C_{i,\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}}^{\\alpha\\bar{f}\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}\\bar{\\mathbf{e}}r}+\\varepsilon_{i\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}}\\left[1\\right]}\\end{array}$ where Prod_growtl $i_{1,1}$ is one-year productivity growth of firm $i$ in year $t$ Productivity growth represents either TFP growth or partial (capital or labor) productivity growth.4 $X_{i,\\tau}$ is a set of control variables. In particular, we include country dummies, industry dummies and year dummies which allow us to control for cross-sectional differences among countries, industries and acrosstime, respectively.\\* We also include firm age. $\\sharp_{\\bar{\\downarrow}}$ represents firm-fixed effects; they are included to control for unobserved heterogeneity at firm-level that may lead to a biased estimate of VC coefficients. $\\Xi_{i\\bar{\\Gamma}}$ is an i.i.d. error term. Vcpre is a dummy variable that equals 1 for firm $i$ receiving VC financing in the two years prior to the first VC round (i.e. from $t{-}2$ to $t$ ，with $t$ representing the VC investment year), and O otherwise. $\\frac{\\mu}{V}\\bar{C}_{\\bar{1},\\bar{1}}^{\\mathrm{in}}$ is a dummy that equals 1 for firm $i$ receiving VC financing, starting from the following year after the VC investment until the end of the holding period (i.e. from $t{+}I$ until the VCs' exit year, with $t$ representing the investment ya), and o otherwise. $\\mathbb{V}\\mathbb{C}_{1,1}^{\\mathrm{after}}$ equals for ion $i$ that eceived VC financing for later years, i.e. after VCs' exit year, and O otherwise.  \n\nTo test H1 we look at the coefficient of Vc?re, , representing the screening activity performed by VCs. If the coefficient is not significant we may conclude that screening does not significantly determine the future outperformance of VC-backed firms.  \n\nH2 aims at estimating the value-adding effect provided by VCs. To test this effect, net of the screening effect, we need to perform the following Wald test:  \n\n$$\n\\gamma_{i n}-\\gamma_{i n s}\\gamma=0\n$$  \n\n[2]  \n\nSimilarly for H3, we test the (alleged) imprinting effect (i.e. the persistence in firm performance after VCs' exit) by verifying whether the productivity growth after VCs' exit is not lower than that achieved before VCs' entry. We perform the following Wald test:  \n\nAs regards H4, which explores the timing of the value-adding effect engendered by VCs on firm's productivity growth, we use the following regression framework (similar to that suggested by Chemmanur et al., 2011):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{P r o d\\_g r o w t h_{i t}=\\alpha_{0}+\\mu_{i}+\\beta\\boldsymbol{x}_{i,\\mathrm{t}}+\\gamma_{\\overline{{p r e}}}V C_{i,\\mathrm{t}}^{\\overline{{p r e}}}+\\gamma_{\\overline{{s}}\\overline{{n}}o r e\\mathrm{t}}V C_{i,\\mathrm{t}}^{\\overline{{s}}\\overline{{n}}o r t}+\\gamma_{l o n g}V C_{i,\\mathrm{t}}^{l o n g}+\\varepsilon_{i t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere Vcghort is a dummy that equals 1 in the first two years following the first VC round (i.e. from $_{t+1}$ to $_{t+2}$ , with $t$ representing the investment year, as suggested by Bertoni et al., 2011), and vclong equals 1 for later years (i.e. from $_{t+3}$ until the end of the observation period), and O otherwise.  \n\nThe impact of VCs in the short and long term, net of the screening effect, can be obtained by performing the following Wald tests, respectively:  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}{\\gamma_{s t o r a s}-\\gamma_{s r a}>0}\\ {~}\\ {\\gamma_{s o n g}-\\gamma_{s r a}>0}\\end{array}$ [5] [6]  \n\n## 3.2. The dependent variables  \n\nWe analyze both TFP growth and partial (labor and capital) productivity growth measures. TFP measures the residual growth in a firm's output not accounted for by the growth in inputs (namely labor and capital), given the production technology in place in the firm's industry.  \n\nMore specifically, to estimate TFP, we resort to the GMM-system (GMM-SYS) estimator developed by Blundell and Bond (2000).\\* In accordance with Van Biesebroeck (2007), we estimate TFP separately for each industry. Then, in the final step, the residuals of the production function are used to estimate firm's TFP growth.?  \n\nWe estimate labor and capital productivity growth measures as the ratio between logarithms of sales and payroll expenses and the ratio between logarithms of sales and fixed assets, respectively.  \n\nOne may argue that labor productivity growth is a better measure of performance than TFP growth, because the measurement of labor productivity does not require the measurement of capital. In fact, the measurement of capital is difficult due to quality heterogeneity and, therefore, the estimates of TFP, as well as capital productivity, heavily depend on how capital is measured. Nevertheless, partial productivity measures are also subject to important criticism. Unlike TFP, labor and capital productivities are only partial measures of firm productivity. In particular, even if there is no improvement in productive efficiency, labor and capital productivities increase when other production inputs are used more relative to labor and capital inputs, respectively. In other words, partial productivities are valid measures of firm efficiency only if the proportion of each productive input remains constant.  \n\nThe use of productivity growth as an indicator of the performance of entrepreneurial firms operating in high-tech industries is well-established in different streams of literature: entrepreneurship (e.g. Colombo et al., 2009; Cowling, 2003; Harada, 2004), finance (e.g. Chemmanur et al., 2010, 2011; Maksimovich and Phillips, 2001, 2008; Schoar, 2002), economics (e.g. Aghion et al., 2009; Aitken and Harrison, 1999; Cingano and Schivardi, 2004; Colombo et al., 2011; Hall and Mairesse, 1995; Javorcik, 2004; McGuckin and Nguyen, 1995) and innovation (e.g. Grilli and Murtinu, 2012a).10  \n\n## 3.3. The estimation methodology  \n\nEquation [1] and equation [4] can be estimated using different estimation techniques. First, we make use of an OLS estimation in which we considered firmspecific effects as equal among all firms. In OLS estimations we control for selection by using a matched sample (as described in Section 4.1) and by inserting the term Vcprs that isolates productivity growth differences between VC-backed firms and non-VCbacked ones before the receipt of VC financing.  \n\nSecond, to properly evaluate the value-adding effect of VCs, we also use to the two-step system generalized method of moments estimator (GMM-SYS, Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998) with finite-sample correction (Windmeijer, 2005). The use of GMM-SYS allows us to estimate the impact of VC by controlling for its endogenous nature. Thus, we estimate both Equation [1] and Equation [4] through the use of GMM-SYS by excluding the term $V C_{i,k}^{z e a s t}$ and by considering the VC variables as endogenous (i.e. instruments start from t-2). However, to avoid the use of a large number of instruments resulting in significant finite sample bias, and the possibility of measurement errors causing potential distortions in our estimates, the instrument set is restricted with moment conditions in the interval between $t{-}2$ and t-3 (see Bond, 2002; Roodman, 2009).  \n\nMoreover, we follow an approach inspired by Sorensen (2007), adding to the set of instruments of the GMM-SYS estimator an additional variable (VC_fundratsim $A_{i}$ which reflects the availability of VC funds at time $t$ in the country in which the focal entrepreneurial firm $i$ operates. This variable represents a good instrument since it is correlated to VC variables , but independent from the error terms of the model. This way, independently of firm’s future productivity growth perspectives, the likelihood of obtaining VC is higher if the firm operates in a geographical area with an abundance of VC. However, the effect of VC on firm's productivity growth is independent of vc_fundratsin $\\theta_{i}$ , and so it is a source of exogenous variation (in a similar vein, see also, Bottazzi et al., 2008; Chemmanur et al., 2011; Ivanov and Xie, 2010).  \n\n# 4.  Data and descriptive statistics  \n\n## 4.1 Sample selection process  \n\nThe sample we used in this study is extracted from the VICO dataset. It includes data on entrepreneurial firms operating in seven European countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). VICO dataset stores information on two strata of firms, VC-backed firms and non-VC-backed (but potentially investable) ones. All firms included in the VICO dataset were: i) less than 20 years old in 2010; i) were independent at foundation (i.e. not controlled by other business organizations); and operate in medium and high-tech manufacturing and services industries (see Table 2). 12  \n\n# [Table 2]  \n\nBoth the groups of VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms include surviving and non-surviving firms (i.e. firms that ceased operations or were acquired). Data were collected through a variety of commercial and proprietary sources. For VC-backed firms, data were first obtained from VentureXpert. More specifically, the VICO dataset includes all equity (or equity-like) financing provided by VCs to entrepreneurial firms in the early stages of their life (seed, early-stage, late-stage and expansion capital).13 Then, other sources (e.g. investor annual reports, investor websites, press releases, VC association yearbooks in each of the seven European countries included in the VICO dataset, Zephyr) were used to improve the coverage of the dataset and cross-check the information. VC-backed firms that received their first round of investment after the tenth year since their foundation were not included. The VICO dataset includes VCbacked firms invested between 1994 and 2004. The main source for data on non-VCbacked firms was Amadeus. Other sources were also used to improve the coverage of the dataset (e.g. Creditreform in Germany, Italian business community's data bank in Italy).  \n\nWe report a more detailed description of the VICO dataset in Appendix B.  \n\nThe sample selection process we used in this analysis was based on several steps. First, for both VC and non-VC-backed firms, we constructed an unbalanced panel of firms whose data on input (labor costs and fixed assets value) and output (sales value) variables were available for at least five consecutive years. This strict requirement is a necessary condition since we lost one-year data in the GMM estimation of TFP (Blundell and Bond, 2ooo) because of first differences, and data on four consecutive years are required to test second-order serial correlation, as Arellano and Bond (1991) pointed out. This first step shrank our dataset to 359 VC-backed firms and 3,956 nonVC-backed firms.  \n\nSecond, we built a matched sample of non-VC-backed firms that is comparable to the sample of VC-backed firms according to a set of a priori defined characteristics (for a similar procedure in the VC literature, see e.g. Brau et al., 2004; Chemmanur et al., 2011; Engel and Keilbach, 2007; Jain and Kini, 1995; Megginson and Weiss, 1991; Puri and Zarutskie, 2012; Tian 2012). In fact, as we explained in Section 2.1, the receipt of VC financing cannot be plausibly interpreted as the result of a random process. Conversely, it is subject to a possible selection bias, i.e. firms choose whether or not to apply for VC funding and VCs select their portfolio firms from the pool of potentially investable firms. From an empirical point of view, the group of VC-backed firms may differ from that of non-VC-backed ones before the initial VC round. A matching estimator solves, at least partially, this selection bias. More specifically, we selected control group firms by using a propensity score method. The aim is to find, for each  \n\nVC-backed firm that received VC financing in year $t$ pairs of non-VC-backed firms that in the same year $t$ had the most similar probability (i.e. propensity score) of receiving VC. In particular, propensity scores are obtained by estimating, for each investment year, a probit model in which the dependent variable is the probability of receiving VC and the independent variables include firm age, firm size, country and industry dummies.14 This second step shrank our dataset to 267 VC-backed firms and 429 nonVC-backed firms.  \n\nIt is important to note that the matching procedure allows us to control for observed heterogeneity among treated and untreated firms, represented only by the characteristics included in the matching process. However, as discussed in the previous section, in order to properly evaluate the impact of VC financing, we resort to: i) a model specification that allows us to control for unobserved effects; and i) a GMM estimation in order to control for the endogenous nature of VC.  \n\n## 4.2 Descriptive statistics  \n\nThis study deals with a total matched sample of 696 firms, 267 of which are VCbacked. Matched firms are located in six European countries15 and were established between 1984 and 2004.  \n\nFor each firm in the sample, accounting data are available from their foundation (whenever possible) up to 2010 (or until available). Our sample includes 5,257 firmyear observations (i.e. 7.55 yearly observations per firm).  \n\nThe breakdown of our sample by country, industry16 and foundation period is  \n\nprovided in Table 3.  \n\n# [Table 3]  \n\nMatched control group firms are distributed very similarly to VC-backed ones, as confirmed by Chi-squared tests $(\\chi^{2}[5]=8.81$ ， $\\chi^{2}[6]=3.52$ and $\\chi^{2}[3]=3.92$ for country, industry and foundation period, respectively). This is not surprising, given that we included country dummies, industry dummies and age in the matching process. The effectiveness of our matching procedure is confirmed by looking at the composition of the control group before matching, in the last columns of Table 3. In fact, significant differences (at $1\\%$ significance level) are found between the control group as a whole (i.e. before matching) and the subsample of VC-backed firms, as confirmed by Chisquared tests $(\\chi^{2}[5]=832.15$ ， $\\chi^{2}[6]{=}474.64$ and $\\chi^{2}[3]{=}652.25$ for country, industry and foundation period, respectively).17  \n\nIn Table 4, we report some descriptive statistics about size (in terms of total assets, fixed assets and sales), employment (in terms of payroll expenses and headcount) and age for VC-backed and matched non-VC-backed firms.  \n\n# [Table 4]  \n\nWe show summary statistics, such as mean, median and number of observations for each category in both pre and post-investment periods.18 Moreover, for every variable, we perform t-tests on the difference-in-mean between the group of VC-backed firms and the matched control group. With the exception of age,f? we do not find significant differences between VC-backed firms and the matched control group before the initial VC round. Conversely, after the first VC round, VC-backed firms are, on average, larger than non-VC-backed firms in terms of total assets, sales, payroll  \n\nexpenses and headcount. This evidence seems to suggest a positive effect of VC on the growth of portfolio firms.  \n\nTable 5 shows descriptive statistics (such as mean, median and number of observations) on TFP and partial productivity growth of VC-backed firms against the matched control group, both in the years before and after the first VC round.  \n\n# [Table 5]  \n\nFor all productivity growth measures we perform t-tests on the difference-in-mean between the VC-backed firms and the matched control group. No significant differences are found in the pre-investment period in terms of TFP growth and labor productivity growth. However, in the pre-investment period, VC-backed firms show a lower capital productivity growth than matched non-VC-backed firms (the difference is significant at $5\\%$ confidence level). Capital productivity is the measure of how well capital (both material and immaterial) is used in providing goods and services. For instance, a lower capital productivity growth could be related to firms that so far had not benefited, in terms of sales made, from the outcomes generated by their investments. This result becomes visible with the ability of VCs to pick firms possessing higher quality capital (e.g. patents) not already exploited and to support those firms in profiting from it.  \n\nVC-backed firms turn out to be more productive than matched non- VC-backed firms after the receipt of VC financing, in terms of both TFP growth and labor productivity growth. Moreover, the difference in capital productivity growth in the postinvestment period is not significant. These unconditional summary statistics seem to suggest that VCs: i) do not show a significant performance in their screening activity (in terms of TFP and labor productivity growth); and i) contribute to increasing firm’s productivity growth.  \n\n# 5. Results  \n\nTable 6 reports the results of Equation [1]. The dependent variables are TFP growth (columns I and II), capital productivity growth (columns II and IV) and labor productivity growth (columns V and VI), respectively. Columns I, MI and V refer to OLS estimations, whereas II, IV and VI report GMM estimations.  \n\n# [Table 6]  \n\nAs regards H1, we find that VC-backed firms do not exhibit significantly different TFP and labor productivity growth to those of their matched counterparts before the first VC round, thus excluding a screening effect by VCs. In terms of capital productivity growth, we find a negative and statistically significant coefficient. This last result is in line with the descriptive statistics shown, as preliminary evidence, in Table 5. This finding could be interpreted as if VCs were able to pick firms possessing higher quality capital (e.g. patents) not already exploited in terms of higher sales and allegedly help them in profiting from it. Therefore, European data on entrepreneurial firms in high-tech industries seem to reject H1 on the screening ability of VCs. This evidence differs from the findings of Chemmanur et al. (2011), which are based on a sample of American manufacturing firms.  \n\nH2 and H3 focus on the impact of VCs on firm's productivity growth in the postinvestment period. We estimate the value-adding effect engendered by VCs and the potential persistence of this effect on portfolio firms' productivity growth (even after VCs' exit). To properly evaluate the value added provided by VCs in OLS estimation, net of the screening effect, we resort to the Wald tests described in Section 3.1 and reported in the last rows of Table 6. TFP and capital productivity growth are significantly higher in VC-backed firms during the holding period. Moreover, portfolio firms do not exhibit a decrease in TFP, capital productivity and labor productivity growth measures after VCs' exit, thus suggesting an imprinting effect of VCs. In other words, portfolio firms are able to maintain the higher productivity level achieved during the holding period.  \n\nIt is also worth noting that the effect of VC involvement seems to be persistent over time on capital productivity growth in OLS estimations (but not in GMM estimates). Either before or after VCs' exit, the capital productivity growth of VCbacked firms is significantly higher than that of the matched control group at $1\\%$ and $5\\%$ statistical significance levels. However, this result might be driven by a ésubstitution effect' in input factors. In other words, VC endorsement could shift portfolio firms towards less capital-intensive production processes. Portfolio firms may use less capital with respect to labor, as roughly suggested in Table 4. Unfortunately, we cannot test this 'substitution effect because we do not have data on materials, energy and fuel (for a similar exercise, see Hirukawa and Ueda, 2008).  \n\nQuite surprisingly, labor productivity growth in VC-backed firms is not significantly higher than that of matched non- VC-backed firms in the holding period. As explained before, also this result might be driven by a substitution effect in input factors. VCs might shift portfolio firms towards more labor-intensive production processes. In other words, portfolio firms may use more labor (e.g. in terms of higher salaries and wages) with respect to capital (see again Table 4). These results are consistent with the interpretation that VCs employ higher quality workers during their holding period in order to improve portfolio firms' operating efficiency, as previously documented by Hellman and Puri (2002).  \n\nTables 7, 8 and 9 allow us to test H4 by showing the results of Equation [4]. The dependent variables are TFP growth, capital productivity growth and labor productivity growth, respectively. In these models, the coefficients of $V C^{s h o r t}$ and $\\mathbf{VC}^{l o n g}$ represent the impact of VCs in the short term and long term, respectively. As in Table 6, to evaluate the value added provided by VCs, net of the screening effect, in OLS estimation we resort to the Wald tests explained in Section 3.1. Each table reports both OLS and GMM estimations (column I and II, respectively) on the full matched sample. In addition, with the purpose of completely excluding any selection effect, the third column of each table reports the results obtained performing GMM estimations on the subsample of VC-backed firms only.  \n\n[Table 7] [Table 8] [Table 9]  \n\nIn both OLS and GMM estimations our results on TFP growth are consistent with Chemmanur et al. (2011), who find that VC-backed firms exhibit a higher TFP growth in the first years after the initial VC round. However, Chemmanur et al. (2011) also find a statistically significant long term effect on TFP growth.  \n\nWith regard to the two variables measuring partial productivity growth, there is a positive and significant effect on firm productivity growth in the short term, whatever the dependent variable used. We interpret the discrepancy in results on labor productivity growth obtained in estimating equation [1] and equation [4] by assuming that the positive effect engendered by VCs is not related to its presence, although it acts in the first years after VCs’ entry. We also find a positively significant impact on capital productivity growth from the third year after $\\mathrm{VCs}^{\\prime}$ entry on at $1\\%$ confidence level both through OLS and GMM estimations on the subsample of VC-backed firms. This finding is in line with what we found in equation [1] through OLS.  \n\nFinally, as regards control variables, we find a negative coefficient of firm age (even though not always statistically significant) in all the estimates. This result is coherent with the extant empirical literature.  \n\nWe ran several different checks to test the robustness of our findings. The results of these additional estimates are reported and discussed in Appendix D.  \n\n# 6.  Further analyses  \n\nAs explained in Section 2.1, we model VCs' screening as a process based on the 'current' economic performance of potentially investable entrepreneurial firms (for a similar approach see e.g. Chemmanur et al., 2011 and Davila et al., 2003). Even though this idea is well grounded in both finance and entrepreneurship literature, VCs might select their portfolio firms through the assessment of their 'potential performance'. Moreover, firm's potential performance might be influenced by the environmental settings in which the focal firm operates (e.g. Clarysse et al., 2011).21  \n\nIt is worth noting that in the VC literature (e.g. Kaplan and Lerner, 2010) the potential performance of portfolio firms is directly related to their market value at the time of VCs' exit (through IPO or trade sale). In this vein, our dependent variables are well suited to measure firm value. First, Chemmanur et al. (2011) show that productivity growth is positively related to the probability of IPO.?? Second, Schoar (2002) suggests that productivity growth is linked to firm profits (and so to firm  \n\nvalue).23 To some extent, through the use of productivity growth we provide an indirect measure of firm value without incurring the well known disadvantages related to the direct measures of profitability (see Griffiths et al., 2011). Third, Hirukawa and Ueda (2008) claim that another proxy of firm value is labor productivity growth. In fact, the latter measure is used by financial analysts to assess the portfolio firm's ability to generate cash flows in the years after VC funding.24  \n\nHowever, to remove any doubts about the reliability of our results, we try to control for the 'potentially different' growth orientation between VC-backed and matched non-VC-backed firms before VC funding.2? We consider two common measures of growth orientation:?° the ratio between intangible assets and total assets (e.g. Caves, 1982; Itami, 1987; Myers, 1977) and the number of employees (Chandler et al., 2009).  \n\nAs regards the latter, Chandler et al. (2009, p. 375) claim that: 'For the managers of emerging ventures, hiring permanent employees may respond to opportunities to expand, gain market share, and provide employment'. Moreover, a growth in the number of employees is a signal that the 'venture is equipped with new human capital through which its objectives can be executed' (Gilbert et al., 2006). As shown in Table 4, we do not find significant differences between VC-backed firms and matched nonVC-backed firms before the initial VC round in term of number of employees. In other words, if the number of employees is a good proxy of firm's growth orientation, there are not statistically significant differences between VC-backed and matched non-VCbacked firms in terms of potential performance. This result seems to confirm the absence of a screening effect by VC in European entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nWith regard to the first measure of growth orientation (i.e. the ratio between intangible assets and total assets), Mahoney and Pandian (1992, p. 370) suggest that 'intangible resources supply the genetics of firm heterogeneity. To some extent, this measure seems to be tailored to capture significant differences in growth orientation between VC-backed and matched non-VC-backed ones before the first VC round. This argumentation is also confirmed by Itami (1987), who claimed that intangible assets are often the only source of competitive advantage that can be sustained over a long period.2 f VCs select porfolio firms on the basis of their intangible assets, our results on value added provided by VCs to their portfolio firms might be misleading. Thus, to isolate the effect of VC value added from VC screening (allegedly or at least partially based on growth orientation), we employ a switching regression-type methodology with endogenous switching.\"\\* In the first stage, we run a probit model to predict the likelihood of getting VC funding and we obtain the inverse Mills ratios for VC-backed and matched non-VC-backed firms. Among the covariates, we include the ratio between intangible assets and total assets, firm age, the annual VC fundraising in the country in which the focal entrepreneurial firm operates (see Section 3.3), the average TFP level in the two years before VC funding (or before the inclusion in the matching procedure for matched non-VC-backed firms), country dummies, industry dummies and year dummies. In the second stage, we run two separate OLS regressions for VC-backed and matched non-VC-backed firms, respectively. The dependent variables are represented by TFP growth. The covariates include the inverse Mills ratios estimated in the first stage (to account for the endogenous nature of VC screening based on unobservable factors) and all of the covariates included in the first stage with the exclusion of VC fundraising.\" The predicted values of TFP growth are used to answer to the following questions: i) what would the TFP growth of a VC-backed firm have been had it not received VC funding?; ii) what would the TFP growth of a matched non-VC-backed firm have been had it received VC funding?  \n\nPanel A of Table 10 reports the results of our analysis. In the first stage (column I), firm age has a positive impact on the likelihood of getting VC funding. As regards the exclusion restriction, the coefficient of VC fundraising is positive and significant. With regard to the variables of interest, prior average TFP is not significant in predicting VC backing, thus confirming our results on H1, about screening ability based on past productivity growth. Conversely, the ratio between intangible assets and total assets is positive and significant, thus casting some doubts about our results on VC screening based on growth opportunities. However, when we look at second stage results (columns II and Il), we see that the inverse Mills ratios calculated in the first stage are positive and statistically significant in both equations. These finding reassure us about the reliability of our results on screening shown in Section 5. In fact, in the event of a positive effect of VC screening on subsequent TFP growth of VC-backed firms, we would expect a positive and statistically significant coefficient in the regression for VC-backed firms but a non statistically significant coefficient in the regression for matched non-VC-backed firms. Conversely, we can safely claim that in our sample there is not a VC screening that positively affects the future TFP growth of  \n\nVC-backed firms. More interestingly, the ratio between intangible assets and total assets is not significant in both second stage equations. So, it seems that the higher TFP growth of VC-backed firms than that of matched non-VC-backed firms is not driven by their different growth orientation.  \n\nIn Panel B of Table 10, we answer the two abovementioned questions in order to test whether our results on value added hold. VC-backed firms show a TFP growth $43.32\\%$ higher than what the same firms would have shown had they not received VC funding. Similarly, matched non-VC-backed firms show a decrease in TFP growth of $91.31\\%$ than what the same firms would have shown had they received VC funding. To sum up, after controlling for the potential reliance of VCs' screening on proxies of firm's growth orientation, we can safely say that our results seem to be confirmed. First, there is a value-adding effect of VCs on TFP growth of their portfolio firms. Second, there is not a screening effect that positively affects the future TFP growth of VC-backed firms. This latter finding is reinforced by the fact that the TFP growth improvement of VCbacked firms is lower than the absolute value of TFP growth deterioration of matched non-VC-backed firms.  \n\n# [Table 10]  \n\nFinally, we test whether our results on VCs' screening change by controlling for the reputation of the VC investor. As highlighted by Bygrave and Timmons (1992, p. 208): 'It is far more important whose money you get than how much you get or how much you pay for it'. For each VC investor we computed two different reputation measures widely used in the literature (Balboa and Marti, 2007; Tian, 2012, among others): i) total assets value under management; and i) the cumulative number of investments. Both these measures are calculated at the time of VC investment in the focal portfolio firm (source: VentureXpert). More specifically, for each reputation  \n\nmeasure we calculated the median value that acts as threshold between high-reputation VCs and low-reputation VCs. For each reputation measure, we performed a t-test in which the null hypothesis is the equality between high-reputation VC-backed firms and low-reputation VC-backed ones in the average level of portfolio firm's TFP in the two years before VC funding. Neither of the t-tests rejects the null hypothesis: Prob (ITI>ltl) $=0.5431$ andProb $(|\\mathrm{T}|{>}|\\mathfrak{t}|)=0.2644$ for the total assets under management and the cumulative number of investments, respectively). This result allows us to exclude a different screening ability among VCs with different reputation.  \n\n# 7. Discussion and conclusions  \n\nThe analysis of the impact of VC financing on the performance of European entrepreneurial firms is important for managers, VCs and government authorities. There are many empirical papers that have shown the superior performance of VC-backed firms after the first VC round. Nevertheless, since it is well documented that VC managers follow a very well-structured screening process, critics have often pointed out that portfolio firms perform better because they were actually better before the investment.  \n\nWe proposed a procedure that allows us to control for such reverse causality concerns and furthermore that allows isolating the ‘value added’ effect from the purely financial effect. First, our results show that productivity growth is not significantly higher in VC-backed firms than matched non-VC-backed firms before the first VC round. This is not in line with some previous studies, mostly based on US manufacturing firms. Such studies provide evidence of the strong screening abilities of US VCs. This difference in screening abilities between US and European VCs might be explained by the higher level of development of US VC market (than that of the  \n\nEuropean VC market) in financing entrepreneurial firms (e.g. Hege et al., 2003). We also test whether our results on screening were not driven by either different growth orientation between VC-backed firms and matched non-VC-backed ones or the reputation of VCs.  \n\nSecondly, we show that productivity growth is substantially higher in VC-backed firms than in matched non-VC-backed ones after the first VC round. Moreover we find an 'imprinting' effect of VC as portfolio firms' productivity growth does not decrease after VCs' exit. Finally, we find that the impact of value-adding services provided by VCs is higher in the first two years after the first VC round.  \n\nThis paper contributes to the extant VC literature in several ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first large-scale multi-country empirical study in Europe on the impact of VC financing on entrepreneurial firms' performance in high-tech industries. Second, we address the reverse causality issue that arises from the idea that it is ‘screening’ rather than ‘value added′ that drives the superior performance of VCbacked firms. Third, we suggest productivity growth measures as a way to distinguish between financial support and non-financial value added provided by VCs and provide evidence on the importance of the latter as the main driver of the better performance of VC-backed firms. Fourth, it is the first study in VC literature aimed at investigating the presence of an “imprinting effect’ of VCs on firm performance. Finally, most previous studies in this field suffer from methodological weaknesses, which are solved in our work.30  \n\nWe are aware that this study has some limitations, which open up opportunities for future research. First, we focus on six European countries. This raises the issue of whether our results could be extended to other European countries. In particular, the VC market in Europe is not as mature as in the Us. Therefore, having access to VC is probably more important (even though more difficult) for European entrepreneurial firms than for their US counterparts. Moreover, VCs' screening abilities might be more effective in the US because they have more experience. As suggested by Hege et al. (2003, p.4): 'venture capital firms in Europe [..] seem to be still lagging in their capacity to select projects. [..] US VCs have better screening skills (due to their greater experience) than European ones. It follows that US VCs are better at sorting out good projects from bad ones\". This might also explain the differences found in our results, when compared to those based on US data (e.g. Chemmanur et al., 2011). Thus, it could be very useful in future works to compare US and European VC industries to understand the peculiarities as well as the features Europe has in common with the United States. Second, it would be interesting to analyze whether the support provided by different types of VCs (e.g. independent, corporate, and governmental) differs significantly. In fact, VCs constitute a quite heterogeneous crowd, especially in Europe where non-traditional VCs play an eminent role (Bottazzi et al., 2004; Tykvova, 2006). Indeed, we expect that the effect of VC financing should differ according to the identity of the investor (Tykvova and Walz, 2007; Grilli and Murtinu, 2011, 2012b). Third, even though the use of productivity growth is a strength in this work, it would be interesting to go a step further and examine what precisely are the sources of the positive effect of VC endorsement on the productivity growth of European entrepreneurial firms, i.e. whether it is mainly an output side (revenue growth) or an input side (cost saving) effect. Fourth, future research should be able to test the ^substitution effect' in  \n\nproduction inputs as we suggested in Section 5. Unfortunately, we do not have data to test that idea. It would also be interesting to check whether the potential ^substitution effect is related to country-specific and/or industry-specific characteristics (e.g. the potential size of the labor force, the value of R&D investment). Finally, it is worth noting that, as in almost all of the extant literature, we do not have information on other types of financing than VC (e.g. business angels, public funds, other types of pre-seed funding). This important issue, which goes beyond the scope of our work, deserves a careful evaluation in future research.  \n\nIn spite of the above limitations, this study considerably extends our understanding of the impact of VC investments on the performance of European entrepreneurial firms in high-tech industries. From a policy perspective, this study reveals that VC financing is a valid tool for improving the performance of European entrepreneurial firms and indirectly to increase the dynamic efficiency of the economic system. Since the business environment in Europe makes it difficult for VCs to successfully develop and exit entrepreneurial firms, incentive schemes should be further developed to enhance this type of investment (for a review of the European policy initiatives in recent years, see Bertoni and Croce, 2011).  \n\n## Acknowledgements  \n\nThis research was conducted with the support of the 7th European Framework Program (Grant agreement no.: 217485).

We assume a Cobb-Douglas production function. Mairesse and Hall (1996) show that the use of GMM-difference (hereafter, GMM-DIF) (Arellano and Bond, 1991) to estimate Cobb-Douglas production functions produces biased estimates, leading to a downward-bias in the estimation of the coefficient of capital. Moreover, returns to scale are greatly decreasing. This is due to the fact that GMM-DIF relies on first-differenced equations of the production function. But the series of inputs (capital and labor) and output (sales) are highly persistent and thus their lags represent weak instruments for the first-differenced equation (Blundell and Bond, 1998).31 Blundell and Bond (2000) suggest that these problems are related to the weak correlations that exist between the current growth rates of firm output, capital and employment, and the lagged levels of these variables. GMM-SYS (Arellano and Bover, 1995) alleviates the typical problem of weak instruments characterizing the GMM-DIF estimator. In fact, it also uses the first differences of the inputs as instruments for the level equation.  \n\nBlundell and Bond (2000) show the importance of modeling a first-order autoregressive component in the error term of the production function. The residuals of the production function also include a fixed effect and the common i.i.d. component capturing potential transitory productivity shocks and measurement errors. In accordance with Blundell and Bond (2000), we employ this model:  \n\n$y_{i\\tau}=\\beta_{l}l_{i\\tau}+\\beta_{k}k_{i\\tau}+\\gamma_{\\tau}+\\eta_{i}+\\nu_{i\\tau}+\\zeta_{i\\tau}$ [A.1] where $v_{i\\neq}=\\rho v_{i\\neq-1}+\\varepsilon_{i\\colon}$ [A.2] and $y_{i t}$ is the logarithm of the sales of firm $i$ at time $t$ $k_{i t}$ is the logarithm of fixed assets (tangible and intangible assets) of firm $i$ at time $t;^{32}l_{i\\neq}$ is the logarithm of payroll expenses of firm $i$ at time $t;^{33}\\mathbb{Y}_{t}$ is a vector of year dummies; ${\\eta_{i}+\\gamma_{i t}+\\zeta_{i t}}$ represents the composite error, given by the sum of a firm-specific unobserved effect, a first-order autoregressive productivity shock and the usual i.i.d. component, respectively. Consistent OLS estimates of the coefficients of the input factors in the equation [A.1] are prevented by a simultaneity problem. In fact, firms choose the input knowing their own level of productivity, leading to a correlation between regressors and the composite error term. Thus, we assume that capital and labor can be correlated with the composite error and we treat them as endogenous.  \n\nIn the equation [A.2], $\\rho$ must be lower than one to ensure stationary assumptions of the model. To estimate the coefficients of capital and labor, we follow Blundell and Bond (2000). Thus, our lagged instruments start from $t{-}3$ $y_{i\\mathrm{t}}=\\rho y_{i\\mathrm{t}-1}+\\beta_{l}l_{i\\mathrm{t}}-\\rho\\beta_{l}l_{\\mathrm{it}-1}+\\beta_{l k}k_{i\\mathrm{t}}-\\rho\\beta_{k}k_{\\mathrm{it}-1}+\\gamma_{\\mathrm{t}}-\\rho\\gamma_{\\mathrm{t}-1}+\\eta_{i}(1-\\rho)+\\varepsilon_{i\\mathrm{t}}+\\zeta_{\\mathrm{it}}-\\$ pt-1 [A.3]  \n\nThis is due to the fact that, in the dynamic representation of the model in equation [A.3], sales, capital and labor at time $t$ may be correlated with productivity shocks in the periods $t$ , t-1 and t-2. Thus, level instruments from the period $t{-}3$ are valid, i.e. they are orthogonal to the error term, under standard exogeneity assumptions on the initial conditions. To estimate the coefficients of capital and labor, we have to impose two non-linear restrictions: i) the coefficient of capital at the period t-1 must be equal to the product (with the opposite sign) of the coefficient of capital at time $t$ and the autoregressive component; i) the coefficient of labor at the period t-1I must be equal to the product (with the opposite sign) of the coefficient of labor at time $t$ and the autoregressive component. These restrictions must be tested and imposed through a minimum distance criterion.34  \n\n# Appendix B - The VICO dataset  \n\nThe VICO dataset has been built thanks to the joint effort of nine universities throughout Europe (Ecole des Mines de Paris, Politecnico di Milano, Libera Universita Carlo Cattaneo, Research Institute of the Finnish Economy, Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW), Universidad Complutense de Madrid, University College London, Vlerick Leuven Management School, and University of Gent) with the support of the 7th European Framework Program (Grant agreement no.: 217485). The objective of the data collection process was to build a large sample of entrepreneurial firms in order to provide a comprehensive picture of VC activity in high-tech sectors in seven European countries: Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.  \n\nAll firms included in the sample were founded after 1984, were independent at foundation, and operate in the industries shown in Table 2. The dataset includes two strata of firms: the first includes a sample of VC-backed firms and the second a control group of non-VC-backed firms. All VC-backed firms received their first round of VC between 1994 and 2004 and were less than 10 years old at that time.  \n\nThe data collection process was performed by eight teams, seven of which were responsible for gathering data on firms responding to the abovementioned criteria in the two strata, and one in charge of the central collection and construction of the overall dataset. Each local team started the identification of the VC-backed sample from a query on VentureXpert and then complemented the list by accessing other, often country-specific, sources such as: VC investor websites, local VC associations, Press releases, Press clippings, IPO Prospectuses, Stock exchange records, Zephyr, the Library House, the ZEW Foundation Panel, VCPro-Database, BVK Directory, the  \n\nResearch on Entrepreneurship in Advanced Technologies (RITA) directory, Private Equity Monitor, Jose Marti's VC Database, and webcapitalriesgo.com. The use of several sources of information allows the dataset to embrace a set of VCs which is usually largely underrepresented by more customary commercial data providers. Moreover, the sample includes both successful and non-successful deals and both surviving and non-surviving (e.g. bankrupt, acquired) firms.  \n\nThe second stratum of the dataset is composed of non-VC-backed firms mainly deriving from a random extraction (conditional on the criteria reported above) from different calendar year versions of Bureau Van Dijk's Amadeus dataset and complemented by other country-specific sources such as: industry associations, Chambers of Commerce, commercial firm directories, Zephyr, Creditreform, the ZEW Foundation Panel, and the Research on Entrepreneurship in Advanced Technologies (RITA) directory. The extraction procedure of the control group ensures the inclusion ol both surviving and non-surviving firms, to avoid the emergence of survivorship bias.  \n\nFor each firm in the sample an in-depth information set was collected, including: general firm information (name, year of foundation, NACE rev. 1.1 and NACE rev. 2 industrial classifications, and NUTS2 geographic area), contact information (address, phone, fax, name and email address of a manager or founder), accounting information, patenting history (from European Patent Office), status (active, liquidated, acquired, inactive), and listing (if the firm went through an IPO and, if so, when). All VCs involved in firms in the VC-backed stratum across all stages were identified and information was collected about their experience, nationality and management typology. For each investor and round of financing, information was sought on: the date on which the investment occurred, the amount invested, the (fully-diluted) equity interest held,  \n\nand the fund(s) (if any) which carried out the transaction. Finally, time and mode of exit (if any) by each investor in each VC-backed firm was also collected.  \n\nInformation collected at local level was checked for reliability and internal consistency by each national team and regularly sent to the central data collection unit, which ensured that information was consistent and comparable across countries and its availability balanced; an increase in the target number of firms was requested when the information set in a country turned out to be sparser than average, to compensate for a higher expected loss of usable firm-year observations. Eventually, the dataset consists of 8,370 firms, 759 of which are VC-backed. The breakdown by country, foundation period and industry is provided in Table A.1.

The number of firms included in our analysis is clearly equal to the number of firms available in the year of the first VC round, in accordance with our matching procedure. However, accounting data necessary to perform our analyses in the year before the first VC round are available only for 422 firms, 158 of which VC-backed. This number shrank to 272 firms, 99 of which VC-backed, if we look at two years before the investment. Similarly, the number of firms observed in the post investment period is decreasing over time.  \n\nTable A.3 provides details on the year of first VC round in our sample.  \n\nTable A.3 Descriptive statistics on the first VC round.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"10\">Year of first VC round</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1995</td><td>1996</td><td>1997</td><td>1998</td><td>1999</td><td>2000</td><td>2001</td><td>2002</td><td>2003</td><td>2004</td></tr><tr><td>n.VC-backed firms</td><td>11</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>17</td><td>24</td><td>69</td><td>44</td><td>20</td><td>29</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>%</td><td>4.12</td><td>3.75</td><td>4.12</td><td>6.37</td><td>8.99</td><td>25.84</td><td>16.48</td><td>7.49</td><td>10.86</td><td>11.99</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nDescriptive statistics show that VC investments in our sample occurred between 1995 and 2004. The number of investments increases from 1995 until 2000, year in which it reaches its peak (69 investments out of 267). In 2001 and 2002 the number of VC investments dramatically falls to 44 and 20 respectively, and remains quite stable until the end of 2004.  \n\nFor 228 out of the 267 VC-backed firms, the dataset includes information on VCs' exit. This information is compulsoy to construt the ariables $V C_{i,i}^{n i}$ and $V C_{i,t}^{c a f t a s r}$ .三 Equation [1].  \n\n# Appendix D - Robustness checks  \n\nAs robustness checks we run additional estimates of Equation [4], only for TFP growth.3° Results are reported in Table A.4.  \n\nFirst, a possible survivorship bias in our data may lead to misleading results. Firms exit our sample for two reasons: i) cease of operations; and i) acquisition by another firm. Both of these events might be influenced by the presence of VC. Firm's survival rate might be influenced by its (potential) access to VC finance, either positively because VC-backed firms benefit from a larger endowment of financial and non-financial resources (Puri and Zarutskie, 2012), or negatively because they become more risk taking (Manigart and Van Hyfte, 1999). The presence of VC is also likely to influence the likelihood that firms are acquired, not least because trade sales are by far the most common way out for VC firms in Europe (Bottazzi et al., 2004). So, if there is a correlation (either way) between VC financing and exit and, in turn, exit was significantly correlated with productivity growth, our estimates would be biased. We thus implement a survivorship bias test in the spirit of Semykina and Wooldridge (2010). The procedure requires the estimation, for each year, of a selection equation for firm exit on the total VICO sample. The dependent variable in these probit models is $e x t t_{i,i}$ , a dummy variable taking value 1 when firm $i$ at time $t$ exited the VICO sample. The independent variables include firm's total assets, firm age, the receipt of VC financing, industry and country dummies. We use the estimated coefficients from these selection models to compute the inverse Mill's ratio of survival for each firm-year observation included in the sample.37 This time-varying inverse Mill's ratio is then inserted as a control for survivorship bias in Equation [4] which is then estimated both by OLS and GMM, respectively. Results are reported in Panel A of Table A.4 (Model I). The coefficient of the survivorship bias control is never significant thus excluding the presence of any remarkable survivorship bias in our sample.  \n\nSecond, we include firm size as a control variable (Model II). In the estimation of firm productivity, we have already controlled for 'size effects' so, as is customary in this type of analysis (e.g. Colombo et al., 2011; Grilli and Murtinu, 2012a), we do not include it in our baseline model. Nevertheless, as a check, we include it to control whether ^firm size effects? drive our results. As you can see in Panel A of Table A.4, the results of Model II are reported in columns II and IV (OLS and GMM estimations, respectively) and are in line with those presented and discussed in Section 5.  \n\nThird, in Panel B of Table A.4 we restrict our VC-backed sample to the 89 firms for which we have all required pre and post-investment observations (Model Il) and compare them with the matched control group sample. The results of Model IlI in the first two columns (OLS and GMM estimations, respectively) are in line with those presented and discussed in Section 5.  \n\nFourth, even though in Section 6 we explained the link between productivity growth measures and portfolio firm value, we re-estimate Equation [4] with a different dependent variable: the logarithm of sales. In entrepreneurship literature, sales is the preferred measure of firm performance (e.g. Chandler et al., 2009; Delmar, 1997; Wiklund and Shepherd, 2003a,b). In the extant VC literature, many works test the impact of VC on such a measure (for a very detailed analysis, see Puri and Zarutskie, 2012). Hellmann and Puri (2000) show that one of the most important effects of VC backing is that VCs speed up the time to market of firms′ products, thus leading the portfolio firm to the commercialization phase as soon as possible. This way, firm sales increase and this acts as a market signal that the firm's business is viable. Puri and  \n\nZarutskie (2012) show that VC-backed firms achieve a higher level of sales than nonVC-backed firms. Moreover, firm age positively impact such difference in sales between VC and non-VC-backed firms. Estimates are reported in the last two columns in Panel B of Table A.4 (OLS and GMM, respectively). As you can see, our results suggest that VCs have a positive effect on firm sales. However, only the impact in the long term is statistically significant. Also in this case, we do not detect a screening effect of VCs. As in our results shown in Section 5, in OLS estimation we resort to the Wald tests explained in Section 3.1.to evaluate the value added provided by VCs, net of the screening effect. Our results are consistent with Chemmanur et al. (2011) and Puri and Zarutskie (2012). However, Chemmanur et al. (2011) also find a statistically significant short term effect on sales.  \n\nTable A.4. Panel A. Robustness checks: Model I and I. Short and long term effects.  \n\nThe dependent variable is TFP growth. Country, industry and year dummies are included in the estimates (coefficients are omitted in the table).

Our analyses are based on the VICO dataset, which avoids the coding problems of VC type in the Thompson Financial SDC dataset. The data indicate that private independent VC-backed companies have better exit performance than government-backed companies. Mixed-syndicates of private-independent and governmental VC investors give rise to a higher (but not statistically different) likelihood of positive exits than that of IVC-backing. Our findings are not influenced by the composition of the syndicate in terms of size and institutional heterogeneity. Our results remain stable after controlling for endogeneity concerns, selection bias, omitted variables bias, legal and institutional differences across countries and over time through several econometric techniques. Moreover, our results are not driven by: i) the holding period of the different types of VC investors; i) the potential signaling effect of GVC towards IVC investors; ii) the firm's financial structure and net cash-flow ratio; iv) the investment stage; v) the distance between the VC investor and the target company.  \n\nKeywords: independent venture capital; governmental venture capital; syndication; exit performance; public-private partnership  \n\n### 1. Introduction  \n\nVenture Capital (\"VC\") is one of the most tailored financing modes for young hightech companies (Gompers and Lerner, 2001; Yung, 2009; Vismara et al., 2012). First, venture capitalists (\"VCs\") provide the financial resources young high-tech companies lack due to capital market imperfections (Andrieu and Groh, 2012).1 Second, VCs perform coaching (Sahlman, 1990; Groh et al., 2010) and monitoring activities (Gompers, 1995; Lerner, 1995; Kanniainen and Keuschnigg, 2003, 2004; Wang and Zhou, 2004; Giot and Schwienbacher, 2007; Hege et al., 2009; Cressy et al., 2007; Dihiya and Ray, 2012). Third, VCs provide access to business contacts and alliance partners (Riyanto and Schwienbacher, 2006; Huang et al., 2008; Wang and Wang, 2012a,b).  \n\nVC firms are funds in which a management company raises capital from a pool of limited partners (e.g. university endowments, banks, pension funds, insurance companies, wealthy individuals, family offices, asset managers), selects target companies and tries to achieve a profitable exit, usually through an IPO or a trade-sale (Sahlman, 1990; Gompers and Lerner, 2001; Nahata, 2008; Nahata et al., 2014).  \n\nHowever, due to historical reasons and to the distinctive features of legal and institutional environments, the supply of VC is extremely different across countries (Groh et al., 2010; Cumming and Johan, 2013). In particular, the gap suffered from European Union (EU) Member States in comparison to the United States (US) is not negligible, both in terms of fundraising and investments. According to an official report of the European Parliament (2012), in 2010 US funds' fundraising activity reached f 10.1 billion ( $0.09\\%$ of GDP) compared to only $\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{~\\textrm~{~~}~}}\\ensuremath{\\epsilon^{\\ \\ }}3.3$ billion in Europe ( $0.03\\%$ of GDP). In terms of investments, the VC amount in the US reached a value of $\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{~\\textrm~{~~}~}}\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{~\\textrm~{~~}~}}\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{~\\textrm~{~~}~}}$ billion $(0.11\\%$ of GDP) compared to $\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{~\\textrm~{~~}~}}\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{~\\textrm~{~~}~}}$ billion ( $0.03\\%$ of GDP) in Europe. The recent financial crisis has further \"stretched the scissors\" (Kraemer-Eis and Lang, 2011).  \n\nThe scant development of the European VC market has in the recent past resulted in a series of policy initiatives at the EU level (the most important one is probably the Risk Capital Action Plan in 1998; European Commission, 1998) directed towards various playing-level fields (e.g., measures aimed at increasing stock market openness and/or labor market flexibility, tax incentives) in order to stimulate both the supply and the demand side of the VC market.  \n\nThese efforts also led to the emergence of a peculiar feature in the EU context: a higher presence of governmental VC (GVC, henceforth) funds than in the US (Leleux and Surlemont, 2003), i.e. VC funds set-up and managed by a company entirely possessed by governmental (or public administration) bodies.2 The economic rationale behind the setting up of GVC funds (GVCs, henceforth) is to adopt a “hands-on policy approach'’ in the VC market and (try to) alleviate the typical chicken-egg paradox of markets where the deal flow is scarce because of shortage of VC but the supply of VC is thin due to the low number of promising business targets.3  \n\nDespite the high number of GVCs in Europe (e.g., Biotech Fonds Vlaanderen in Belgium, SITRA in Finland, CDC Innovation in France, TBG in Germany, Piemontech in Italy, Axis Participaciones Empresariales in Spain, Scottish Enterprise in the UK), the extant literature on the impact of GVC on portfolio companies' performance in Europe is very limited. And to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any attempt in the corporate finance literature to compare their performance with the one achieved by the typical 'Silicon Valley style' independent venture capital (IVC) funds operating in the same European context.  \n\nAs a matter of fact, many previous works dealing with the issue have used a macro perspective to explain which country-specific policy (Groh et al., 2010; Cumming and Johan, 2013) and institutional factors might foster the VC industry in Europe (Cumming and Johan, 2013). Other works examined the performance of extra-European GVC programs.4 Finally, very few country-specific studies focused on the impact of GVC on portfolio companies’ growth performance (e.g., Beuselinck and Manigart, 2000 in Belgium, or Balboa et al., 2007 in Spain). There are a few exceptions in recent working papers, but the trouble is that such papers are based on the Thompson Financial SDC dataset which may misreport fund types (for example, in Canada and Australia, over $50\\%$ of the transactions are reported as being from the wrong fund type). Grilli and Murtinu (2014a,b) analyze the impact of GVC on the growth performance (in terms of sales and employees) of young high-tech companies located in 7 European countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). Using the VICO database, through several econometric techniques, they showed that GVC-backed companies would have followed similar growth patterns even without any GVC investment. Overall, they show that independent (and other typologies of private) VC funds are more effective than GVCs in spurring the growth of portfolio companies. The only positive impact exerted by governmental funds is found to be confined to the syndication with independent (and other private) VC operators, and this result holds only if specific conditions are met.5  \n\nAs to this latter aspect, another untapped gap in the extant literature is the lack of empirical evaluation about the performance, from the investor's point of view, of mixed syndicates composed by GVC and IVC funds (IVCs, henceforth) in the European VC market. This reflects a more general dearth of studies on syndication activities between different types of VC investors in any geographical context. But the issue is relevant. As claimed by Gompers and Lerner (2004), VC investors often tend to syndicate their investments rather than going alone.  \n\nSyndication is reputed to be beneficial for several reasons. First, it may improve the screening process through (at least) a ‘second opinion’ (Gompers and Lerner, 2004; Casamatta and Haritchabalet, 2007). Second, it may increase capital infusion into the portfolio company and leverage the coaching potential of investors through the exploitation of complementary financial and non-financial resources, skills, networks and industry expertise of syndicate members (Andrieu and Groh, 2012). Third, it leads to a reduction of the overall portfolio risk (Gompers and Lerner, 2004) and may convey a signal towards capital markets about the quality of the focal VC-backed company, which may ultimately have a positive influence on the likelihood of a successful exit (Cumming and Johan, 2013).  \n\nIn principle, these benefits (especially the second one of the above-exposed list) could be particularly pronounced when different types of VC investors join the syndicate (Bertoni et al., 2013). However, the intrinsic differences between IVC and GVC investors might also entail agency and transaction costs (e.g., Wright and Lockett, 2003; Cumming et al., 2007). These costs should be higher when the objectives of syndicate partners are incompatible, as might be the case of IVC and GVC investors. As highlighted by Chahine et al. (2012: p. 180), syndicate members “have different objectives which can result in principal-principal conflicts of interests among members of a VC syndicate'.  \n\nOur contribution aims at filling these gaps. Our research questions may be summarized as follows: i) are GVCs by their own able to lead to a positive exit in comparison with traditional IVC investors?; i) how do syndicated investments by GVC and IVC funds perform?; and i) do different structures of mixed IVC-GVC syndicates play a differential effect on the exit performance?  \n\nWe answer to these research questions through the VICO database, a novel firm-level longitudinal dataset sponsored by the European Union under the $7^{\\circ}$ Framework Program (for more details, see Section 3). The VICO dataset includes 8,370 companies from seven European countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) out of which 759 received VC funding between 1994 (or subsequent firm's foundation year) and 2004. In the sample used in this work, firms are observed from 1991 (or year of a firm's foundation) to 2010 (or year of a firm's exit from the dataset).  \n\nAs is customary in the finance literature dealing with VC and exit (e.g., Gompers and Lerner, 2004; Wang and Wang, 2010, 2012b, Cumming and Johan, 2013), our analysis hinges on a multinomial logit approach, distinguishing between positive outcomes (IPOs or trade-sales) and negative ones (liquidations). Our empirical findings highlight a positive contribution of IVC-backing on the likelihood to reach a positive exit. However, the impact of GVC is negligible. More interestingly, mixed IVC-GVC syndicated investments lead to a higher (but not statistically different) likelihood of a positive exit than that of IVC-backing. This positive impact of IVC-GVC syndicates is not found to be influenced by the composition of the syndicate in terms of size and institutional heterogeneity. These results remain stable after controlling for endogeneity concerns, selection bias and omitted variables bias through several econometric techniques: multinomial probit models, semi-parametric Cox-type survival models, panel multinomial logit with random effects, panel probit models on matched samples, and Instrumental Variables (IV) linear probability models. We also controlled for legal and institutional differences across countries  and over time, including  accounting conservatism, accounting disclosure, debt enforcement, regulation of entry, procedural formalism of dispute resolution and property protection rights, creditor rights, stock market capitalization, and the European Union convergence. Moreover, our results are not driven by alternative explanations, such as: i) the holding period of the different types of VC investors; i) the potential signaling effect of GVC towards IVC investors; ii) the firm's financial structure and net cash-flow ratio; iv) the investment stage; and v) the distance between the VC investor and the target company.  \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses issues associated with standalone GVC investments versus syndicated GVC-IVC investments. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 explains the methodology. Section 5 presents the results and robustness tests. Section 6 tests whether our results are driven by alternative explanations. Section 7 concludes.  \n\n### 2. Governmental VC Funds and Government-Private Partnerships  \n\nIn this section we consider three related issues. First, why might GVCs have differential exit performance results relative to IVCs? Second, why might the syndication of GVCs and IVCs impact exit performance? Third, why might the structure in terms of the size and institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate on which GVCs and IVCs operate influence exited performance?  \n\nThe venture capital literature has identified three primary reasons why GVCs may perform worse than IVCs. First, GVCs are created by statute or some other political and regulatory process, and not through private negotiations among contracting parties. In the case of limited partnership venture capital funds, for example, institutional investors (as the limited partners) and the fund manager (as the general partner) contract with each other to efficiently set the terms upon which the funds will be invested into entrepreneurial firms. These covenants include terms such as restrictions on the size of investments, use of debt, co-investment, public disclosure of fund matters, and no-fault divorce provisions, among other things. These clauses mitigate agency problems in fund management, and hence facilitate maximization of returns and investee performance. The frequency of use of these clauses appropriately and efficiently depends on economic, human capital, and institutional conditions (see Gompers and Lerner, 2004 for US evidence, and Cumming and Johan, 2006, 2013 for international evidence). By contrast, GVC covenants are determined by regulators, typically have no resemblance to the covenants used by IVCs, do not vary over time and across fund managers, and are hence much less efficient than IVC covenants (Cumming and MacIntosh, 2007). Second, GVCs are believed to have less efficient compensation terms relative to IVCs. IVCs typically are structured with a $2\\%$ fixed fee (based on committed capital) and a $20\\%$ performance fee, with hurdle rates and clawbacks in the event of poor performance. These fee terms are contractually negotiated and vary depending on economic conditions and the characteristics and experience of the fund managers (see Gompers and Lerner, 2004, for US evidence, and Cumming and Johan, 2013, for international evidence). GVCs, by contrast, are reputed? to have compensation terms that are comparatively invariant across managers and funds, and invariant over time. As such, agency problems in effort are exacerbated among GVCs, and GVCs face employee retention problems among better fund managers that show promise and generate outside offers. Third, GVCs have a lack of independence in decision making. IVCs, by contrast, are legally independent by virtue of the limited partnership structure - limited partners do not get involved in the day-today operation of the fund, otherwise they risk losing their limited liability status. GVCs are much different, and have been known to face pressure to invest in marginal quality projects, as well as geographically remote projects. Relatedly, while IVCs regularly replace founding entrepreneurs as the CEO and have contractual rights to do so (Cumming, 2008; Cumming and Johan, 2013), GVCs face political pressure to not fire founding entrepreneurs and risk political problems if they do so. Furthermore, GVCs face pressure to pursue non-financial related goals, such as employment maximization (Cumming and MacIntosh, 2007).  \n\nThere are a number of reasons why GVC-IVC syndicated relations may enhance performance and overcome the issues identified immediately above. Following the ordering of the three problems with GVCs identified above, the first issue involves limited partnership covenants. By syndicating with IVCs, the investee firms financed by GVCs still enjoy the structural advantages of IVC limited partnerships, which are not compromised by sole financing with a less efficient GVC structure. Second, investee firms are likewise not compromised by sole financing from GVCs with less efficient compensation terms, and enjoy the benefits associated with IVC compensation terms. To the extent that GVC and IVC efforts are substitutable for growing the entrepreneurial firm, the disadvantages of inefficient GVC compensation can be significantly mitigated. Third, decision making is independent among IVCs (i.e., not subject to influence from institutional investors), and not subject to political pressure. This independence mitigates the agency problems of inefficient decision making associated with political pressure from government bodies affecting GVC investment decisions. Finally, an advantage of the GVC-IVC partnership is that the independent sources of networks and contacts that can help the entrepreneurial firms grow are more expansive than merely an IVC syndicate. GVCs would be expected to have access to governmental contacts that may beneficial to the entrepreneurial firm, which could include government-related suppliers and customers, and enable streamlined and faster regulatory approval of business matters that are in the entrepreneurial firm's interest. GVCs enhance IVC value added by expanding the scope of networks and enabling connections to government-related suppliers and customers that could expand the investee firm's set of opportunities to maximize growth. In short, because political connections are valuable, and because IVCs can mitigate the cost of inefficient GVC structures, IVC-GVC syndicated partnership are expected to enable entrepreneurial firms perform better.  \n\nFinally, there are a number of reasons why the structure of the syndicate in terms of its size and institutional heterogeneity on which GVCs and IVCs operate might influence exited performance. On the negative side there are two factors to consider. First, larger funds may give rise to diseconomies of scale and limited attention problems where fund managers sit on too many boards of directors, not maximizing their value-added provided to any single investee (Cumming and Dai, 2011). Second, there can be free-riding amongst syndicated VCs, whereby if the effort of one VC is substitutable with that of another then overall value-added is mitigated as VCs are in conflict with one another in terms of who is responsible for assisting the investee firm. Nevertheless, there are five factors to consider on the positive side (each of these positive outcomes is summarized in Gompers and Lerner, 2004). First, syndication improves decision making and thereby mitigates adverse selection problems, given different individuals with more diverse backgrounds (as would be expected among individuals among GVCs and IVCs) have different expertise to carry out more effective due diligence overall. Second, syndication facilitates improved value added where the effort of different VCs are complementary. Third, diverse syndicated VCs may collude to overstate the quality of the entrepreneurial firm and hence maximize exit opportunities in terms of who will buy the entrepreneurial firm and at what price. Fourth, diversity in syndication enables diversification and risk sharing, which in turn facilitates investment decisions that may not otherwise have been made, and hence improves the scope of feasible outcomes. Finally, diversity in syndicates mitigates hold-up and renegotiation problems vis- $\\cdot\\grave{\\mathrm{a}}$ -vis the entrepreneurial firm in each staged investment round, and hence improves incentives for the entrepreneur to maximize firm value and exit possibilities.  \n\nIn sum, prior literature is consistent with the view that GVCs investing by themselves are expected to have worse exit performance, GVCs syndicated with IVCs are expected to perform better, and that the size and structure of the syndicate can affect agency problems amongst VCs and between VCs and entrepreneurs that can in turn affect exit performance. Below, we test these propositions by examining for the first time the relation between syndicate structure and exit performance.  \n\n### 3. Data  \n\n#### 3.1. Data Collection Procedure  \n\nIn this work, we use the VICO database. The VICO database represents the final output of a research project funded by the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission. The VICO database includes data on young high-tech VC-backed and nonVC-backed (but potentially targetable by VC investors) companies that: i) are located in seven European countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom); ii) are less than 20 years old in 2010; ii) were borne as independent firms (i.e., not controlled by other business organizations); and iv) operate in high-tech (manufacturing and services) industries (see Table 1). The VICO database includes surviving and non-surviving companies (i.e., companies that ceased operations or were acquired), whether they are VC-backed companies or not.  \n\nOverall, the VICO database consists of 8,370 firms, 759 of which are VC-backed (for a full description of the database, see Bertoni and Marti, 2011). In this work, the observed time-span is 1991-2010.  \n\nAs regards the identification of VC-backed companies, several proprietary and commercial sources were used. Country-specific proprietary sources are the yearbooks of the Belgium Venture Capital and Finnish Venture Capital Associations, the ZEW Foundation Panel (Germany), the RITA directory and Private Equity Monitor (Italy), the José Marti Pellon Database (Spain), and the Library House (now Venture Source, UK). Commercial sources are the Thomson One database, VCPro-Database, and Zephyr. Moreover, whenever possible, the data were cross-checked with those available from public sources (e.g., websites and annual reports of VC investors, press releases and press clippings, and initial public offering prospectuses).  \n\nThis data collection process allows us to ensure that the VICO database offers an extensive representation of the European population of VC-backed companies (for more details, see European Parliament, 2012). Even though the most popular database in the VC literature is the Thomson One database, this latter is known to under-represent investments made by non independent VCs (Ivanov and Xie, 2010: p. 135), especially in Europe. As common in the VC literature, the VICO dataset includes seed, early-stage, late-stage and expansion capital investments; while, LBOs, real estate, distressed debt funds and other private equity investments are not included.  \n\nDue to the necessity of a minimum number of post-investment observations to evaluate the impact of VC on the performance of portfolio companies, the VICO database includes VC-backed companies which obtained their first round of VC funding between 1994 and 2004 and were less than 10 years old at that time.  \n\nFor the identification of non-VC-backed companies, we used the Amadeus database. All available vintage years of Amadeus were used to build the population such that nonsurviving companies are included. Analogously to VC-backed companies, specific country-specific proprietary sources were used in order to improve the coverage of the dataset (e.g., Creditreform in Germany, the database of the Union of Italian Chambers of Commerce in Italy).  \n\nA complete description and documentation of the procedures and sources used in the data gathering process and on all of the portfolio company-, investment-, and investorlevel variables included in the VICO dataset, is provided in Bertoni and Marti (2011).  \n\n#### 3.2. Descriptive Statistics  \n\nTo classify companies backed by different types of VC investors, we focus on the year of the first VC investment. We removed from the dataset companies that received a first investment by corporate, bank-affiliated and university-sponsored VC investors; or by VC investors that have missing name, address and/or contact information in the VICO database. It is worth noting that we removed such companies if and only if corporate, bank-affiliated and university-sponsored VC investors did not syndicate with IVCs or GVCs at the time of the first VC investment. We used this criterion to let the counterfactual of companies not backed by IVCs, GVCs or mixed IVC-GVC syndicates as clean as possible. Thus, among VC-backed companies, we keep companies that received a first investment by IVCs, GVCs or a mixed IVC-GVC syndicate. According to these three “states of nature\", we classify companies as IVC-backed, GVC-backed or SYND-backed, respectively.7  \n\nThe breakdown by country and industry of IVC-backed, GVC-backed, and SYNDbacked companies is provided in Table 1.  \n\nThe representation of IVC-backed companies reflects the development of financial markets across countries, being larger in the UK (128 IVC-backed companies, $30.48\\%$ of the total IVC-backed companies), followed by Germany $(19.76\\%)$ and France $(13.81\\%)$ The situation is different by looking at the representation of GVC-backed companies, where Spain has the greatest share $(24.41\\%)$ ,followed by Germany $(16.54\\%)$ and Finland ( $16.54\\%)$ . France has the greatest share of SYND-backed companies $(35.48\\%)$ followed by Germany $(17.74\\%)$ and Belgium ( $14.52\\%)$ . Software represents the main target industry both for IVCs( $39.76\\%)$ and for GVCs $(32.28\\%)$ .Biotechnology & Pharmaceutical represents the second target market both for IVCs ( $18.33\\%$ in conjunction with ICT manufacturing) and GVCs $(27.56\\%)$ . SYND-backed companies show the same industrial representation of GVC-backed companies: the first industry is software $(50\\%)$  \n\nfollowed by  Biotechnology  and  Pharmaceutical $(24.19\\%)$ and  ICT  manufacturing $(16.13\\%)$  \n\n# [Table 1 about here]  \n\nTable 2 illustrates the distribution of positive (IPOs and trade-sales) and negative (liquidations) exits according to the type of VC investor at the time of the first VC investment.  The highest percentage of publicly- or privately-traded VC-backed companies received a first investment by an IVC investor $(74.77\\%)$ , followed by a mixed IVC-GVC syndicate $(14.02\\%)$ and a GVC investor $(11.21\\%)$ . In terms of liquidated VCbacked companies, the highest percentage of them was initially invested by an IVC investor $(69.61\\%)$ . GVC-backed companies represent more than one fifth of liquidated VC-backed companies $(21.57\\%)$ . While, SYND-backed companies represent less than one tenth of liquidated VC-backed companies $(8.82\\%)$  \n\n# [Table 2 about here]  \n\n### 4. Empirical Framework  \n\nWe compare the effects of IVC-, GVC- and SYND-backing on the probability of a successful/unsuccessful exit using a multinomial logit model. The use of multinomial logit models is the most common choice in the literature about the impact of VC on exit (e.g., Cumming et al., 2006; Cumming, 2008; Cumming and Johan, 2013). We estimate the following multinomial logit model: 8  \n\nExitType $=$ f(VC backing, VC size, VC diversity, Controls).  \n\nExit Type is a categorical variable and assumes three different values: 1 for positive outcomes (IPOs or trade-sales), $^{9}2$ for liquidations, and O for the baseline category (companies that did not go public, were not acquired and are still in operation). The likelihood to fall in the outcome $\\mathrm{j}$ $\\mathrm{\\Delta;p_{j}=e x p\\big(X^{\\prime}\\upbeta_{j}\\big)/[1+\\textstyle\\sum_{j=1}^{3}e x p\\big(X^{\\prime}\\upbeta_{j}\\big)]}$ .Exit type is always equal to zero for all companies that did not go public, were not acquired and are still in operation. For companies that went public or have been acquired, it is zero in all years prior to the first positive event (IPO or trade-sale), and it equals one in the year of the first positive exit. It is set to missing in the following years. In the same way, for liquidated companies, Exit type is zero in all years prior to liquidation, and it equals two in the year of liquidation. It is set to missing in the following years.  \n\nVC backing includes 3 step dummy variables (IVC; GVC; SYND) which switch from 0 to 1 in the year following the first VC investment. Similarly to Chahine et al. (2012), we include VC size and VC diversity. VC size represents the yearly number of VC investors backing the young high-tech company at time t-1. VC diversity looks at the VC affiliation (i.e., independent, corporate, bank-affiliated, university-sponsored, governmental) and counts the number of sub-groupings of each VC type backing the young high-tech company at time t-1. Controls includes several classes of variables at portfolio companylevel. First, we include a set of country dummies, (2-digit SIC) industry dummies, and year dummies. Second, we include the logarithm of firm age (measured by the years since firm foundation) and its squared term: $A g e$ and $A g e^{2}$ . Third, following Chahine et al. (2012), we include a bubble dummy (Bubble) which is equal to 1 whether the first VC investment was received in the years 1999 or 2000. Moreover, we take into account the time elapsed since the first VC receipt (proxied by the number of years since the first VC investment): TimeFromVC. Fourth, we introduce a measure of firm size $(S i z e)$ ,proxied by the logarithm of headcount at time t-1. Fifth, we control for the operative performance through a measure of profit margin (measured by the ratio net income/sales) at time t-1 (Richard et al., 2009): ProfitMargin. Note that net income and sales value have been deflated by the Consumer Price Index (source: Eurostat; reference year: 2005). Finally, we control for the innovative performance through the inclusion of the logarithm of the patent stock at time t-1 (with yearly depreciation $_{1}=0.15^{}$ :PatentStock.  \n\nIn Table 3, we report some descriptive statistics for IVC-backed, GVC-backed, SYND-backed and non-VC-backed companies. In terms of VC Size, SYND-backed companies show on average a higher yearly number of VC investors in their equity (3.3) than IVC-backed companies (2) and GVC-backed ones (1.4). As to VC diversity, not surprisingly, SYND-backed companies are on average financed by a higher number of types of VC investors. The average is slightly higher than 2, meaning that generally when governmental and independent VC operators syndicate is rare that other typologies of investor (corporate, bank-affiliated and university-sponsored) join the syndicate. For IVC-backed companies and GVC-backed ones the mean value of the variable is 1.4 and 1.2, respectively. Age distributions are similar across all companies (around 7 years old). IVCs are more likely to invest during the bubble period than GVCs: more than (almost) $40\\%$ of IVC (SYND)-backed companies received their first VC investment in the period 1999-2000. SYND-backed companies are bigger than other companies: on average, SYND-backed companies reach a size of about 39 employees, while headcount is 36 for IVC-backed, 26 for GVC-backed, and 24 for non VC-backed companies. On average, non  VC-backed companies show a higher operating performance than  VC-backed companies (especially if compared to SYND-backed ones). Finally, SYND-backed companies are on average more innovative (1.9 patents) than GVC-backed companies (0.7 patents), IVC-backed companies (0.4 patents) and non VC-backed ones (0.2 patents).  \n\n[Table 3 around here]  \n\n### 5. Findings  \n\n#### 5.1. Results  \n\nResults from the multinomial logit estimates are shown in Table 4. In columns I and IM, we show the results related to the likelihood of a positive exit (IPO or trade-sale); while, in columns II and IV, we show the findings related to the likelihood of a negative exit (liquidation). In columns I and HI, we show the estimates related to the baseline model. The aim is to estimate the (potentially) different impact of IVC-, GVC-, and  \n\nSYND-backing on exit, whatever the number/heterogeneity of the investors in the equity of the focal young high-tech company. In columns II and IV, we insert VC Size and VC Diversity to investigate: i) what is their role on exit performance; and ii) whether the baseline results of IVC-, GVC-, and SYND-backing are unchanged or not.  \n\nIt is worth noting that we report the relative-risk ratios (instead of the estimated coefficients). This implies that a coefficient greater than 1 must be interpreted as a positive impact on the focal exit performance. In the same way, a coefficient smaller than 1 must be interpreted as a negative impact on the focal exit performance. 10  \n\nIn column I, our empirical findings highlight the superior ability of IVCs to reach a positive exit, if compared to GVCs. The impact of IVCs on the likelihood of an IPO or a trade-sale is positive and statistically significant at $1\\%$ . The coefficient of the impact of GVC is of lower magnitude and it is not statistically significant. SYND-backed companies have a higher likelihood to reach a positive exit than IVC-backed companies (and GVC-backed ones). However, the Wald test does not reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the coefficients of $I V C$ and SYND. The impact of mixed IVC-GVC syndicates is positive and statistically significant at $1\\%$ . In column II, we see that VCbacking does not influence the likelihood of liquidation, whatever the type of VCbacking at the time of the first investment.  \n\nIn column Ml, we turn to our augmented model that includes VC Size and VC Diversity. The positive impact of IVC-backing and SYND-backing on the likelihood of a positive exit is not found to be influenced by syndicate size (VC size) and institutional heterogeneity (VC diversity). The impact of IVC-backing is still positive and statistically significant at $1\\%$ (the magnitude is slightly lower than that in column I), and the economic significance is such that an IPO or a trade-sale is $87.3\\%$ more likely when an IVC investor is involved. The coefficient of the impact of GVC is still negligible and of lower magnitude than that of IVC-backing. Again, SYND-backed companies have a higher (but not statistically different) likelihood to reach a positive exit than IVC-backed companies (and GVC-backed ones). The impact of mixed IVC-GVC syndicates is positive and  statistically  significant  at $1\\%$ , and the marginal effect shows a $117.7\\%$ greater likelihood of a positive exit. The magnitude of the impact is slightly lower than that in column I. Also the results on liquidation (column IV) are fully in line with those of column II.  \n\nResults on VC Size and VC Diversity are interesting. While they have a negligible impact on the likelihood of a positive outcome (column Il), their impact on liquidation is dramatic. The higher is the yearly number of VC investors in the equity of the focal young high-tech company, the lower appears the likelihood of a liquidation. This effect is statistically significant at $5\\%$ . The higher is the heterogeneity of the syndicate - in terms of different types of VC investors involved - the higher is the likelihood of a liquidation. This effect is statistically significant at $1\\%$ and its magnitude is extremely high (greater than 6).  \n\n# [Table 4 around here]  \n\nAs regards the control variables, we find a positive linear effect of firm age on the likelihood of a positive exit, while an inverted U-shaped effect on liquidation. Quite surprisingly, the coefficient of Bubble is always negligible: it seems that the time of the first VC investment does not exert any statistically significant influence on the exit outcome. The effect of Size is always statistically significant at $1\\%$ : bigger (smaller) firms are more likely to reach a positive (negative) exit. A higher level of ProfitMargin positively impacts (at $5\\%$ ) the likelihood of a positive exit; while, its impact on the likelihood of liquidation is negligible. The higher is the time elapsed since the first VC investment, the higher is the likelihood of an IPO or a trade-sale. This effect is statistically significant at $5\\%$ in both columns I and Ml. This effect is also explored through the lens of a non-parametric hazard rate analysis performed in Figure 1. On the horizontal and vertical axes, there are the firm age and the estimated unconditional likelihood of a positive exit, respectively. The figure shows a quasi-monotonic increasing positive relationship between the time elapsed since the first VC investment and the likelihood of an IPO or a trade-sale until the firm age is ten years old. The hazard rate (the instantaneous probability of the positive outcome) maintains high between the age of ten and thirteen years old and then starts decreasing.1 Finally, the impact of PatentStock on exit is positive. More specifically, there is a positive and statistically significant effect (at $5\\%$ ) on the likelihood of a positive exit in column I. Instead, this effect is only close to significance (p-value $=0.102\\$ ) even though is still positive in column IIl. Conversely, the effect of a firm's patent stock on the likelihood of a liquidation is negligible.  \n\n[Figure 1 around here] [Figure 2 around here]  \n\n#### 5.2. Selection Bias and Endogeneity Issues  \n\nOur results seem to show that private independent VCs (and mixed IVC-GVC syndicates) are better at developing their portfolio companies than governmental VCs. However, our multinomial logit approach might not take properly into account selection and endogeneity issues. Firstly, our results might be driven by a potential sample selection problem: private independent VCs (and mixed IVC-GVC syndicates) may be simply better at choosing and funding the most promising entrepreneurial firms. Secondly, in a competition to fund the best entrepreneurial firms, private independent VCs (and mixed IVC-GVC syndicates) may be more willing to offer the entrepreneur a better deal than GVCs do. Lastly, GVCs may systematically target portfolio companies which are overlooked by IVCs, and so the empirical comparison of IVC-backed and GVC-backed companies might be misleading (see also Section 6). It is worth noting that this latter problem should not be relevant in our context because of the presence of mixed IVC-GVC syndicates. Whatever the source of potential bias, the econometric problem is related to unobservable (or omitted) variables which explain both the likelihood to receive VC and the likelihood of exit (either positive or negative), and so a spurious correlation between the variables of interest (IVC, GVC, SYND, VC size, VC diversity)  \n\nand exit might drive our results. To tackle these issues, we put in use five different identification strategies.  \n\nFirst, similarly to Chemmanur et al. (2011) and Croce et al. (2013), we inserted in our main specifications (Table 4, columns II and IV) three variables (IVCpre, GVCpre, SYNDpre), which are dummies that equal 1 in the years prior to the first VC investment - provided by an independent VC investor, a governmental VC fund or a mixed IVC-GVC syndicate, respectively - and O otherwise. The coefficients of such variables represent the screening activity performed by IVCs, GVCs and mixed IVC-GVC syndicates, respectively. We tried several (alternative) model specifications, with the three \"VCpre\" dummy variables that equal 1: i) from $t{-}2$ to $t$ - with $t$ representing the year of the first VC investment - and 0 otherwise (Croce et al., 2013); ii) from $t{-}4$ to $t$ - with $t$ representing the VC investment year - and 0 otherwise (Chemmanur et al., 2011); or i) in all years prior to the first VC investment. Moreover, we also substituted each \"VCpre\" dummy variable with a series of impulse dummies from the year $t$ to 5 years before the first VC funding (for a similar procedure, see Grilli and Murtinu, 2014a). Whichever the model specification, our main results are stable and are not influenced by the potentially different screening activity performed by IVCs, GVCs and mixed IVC-GVC syndicates (results are available upon request from the authors). The coefficients of the \"VCpre\" dummy variables are always smaller than one and statistically significant at $1\\%$ ， whichever the type of the VC investor.12 Thus, we found that VC-backed companies are less likely to have a positive or a negative exit than non-VC-backed companies in the years before VC funding. This (apparently counter-intuitive) finding is in line with the evidence based on the VICO dataset (e.g., Croce et al., 2013) and more generally confirms the findings of other EU-based studies (see Grilli, 2014 for a review), that highlight a modest “pick-winner’ function performed by the European VCs compared to the US counterparts. As explained by Croce et al. (2013, p. 503): This difference in screening abilities between US and European VCs might be explained by the higher level of development of US VC market (than that of the European VC market) in financing entrepreneurial firms'. In the same vein, Hege et al. (2003, p.4) claim that: 'venture capital firms in Europe [.] seem to be still lagging in their capacity to select projects. I..] US VCs have better screening skills (due to their greater experience) than European ones. It follows that US VCs are better at sorting out good projects from bad ones'.  \n\nSecond, we tried to control for the quality of the entrepreneurial firm (especially in the pre-VC period for VC-backed companies). Following the most up-to-date corporate finance and entrepreneurial finance literatures, in our main specifications (Table 4, columns II and IV) we inserted: i) a variable (PastSalesGrowth) capturing the growth in sales value from the time t-2 to the time t-1 (see Chemmanur et al., 2010 for the use of past sales growth as a proxy of firm quality); and i) the ratio between intangible assets and total assets (ITA) at time t-1 (according to Croce et al., 2013, this variable controls for the potentially different growth orientation between VC-backed and non-VC-backed companies before the first VC investment, and among the different types of VCbacking).13 Results are shown in Table 5. We found a negligible impact of both variables on the likelihood of both positive and negative exits. This result seems to confirm the low screening ability of European VCs, whichever the type of VC backing.  \n\n# [Table 5 around here]  \n\nThird, we estimated a multilevel latent variable model for unordered categorical responses, in which the latent variables are modeled as random effects.14 We used the same model specification as shown in Eq. (1). The results are shown in Table 6 (columns I and II) and are in line with those exposed in Table 4 (columns III and IV). In column I, the impact of IVC-backing is still positive and statistically significant (at $1\\%$ )on the likelihood of a positive exit, as well as the impact of SYND-backing (statistical significance at $5\\%$ ). As in Table 4, the magnitude of SYND-backing is greater than that of IVC-backing, but the Wald test does not reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two coefficients. The impact of GVC-backing is still negligible. Also in this case, syndicate size and institutional heterogeneity do not exert any impact on positive exit. As regards negative exits (column I), there is no impact of VC-backing per se. However, as in Table 4, there is a positive impact (statistically significant at $10\\%$ )of the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate on liquidation. The only exception of these results when compared to those shown in Table 4 is the negligible impact of the yearly number of VC investors on the likelihood of a liquidation.  \n\nFourth, for each of the three “states of nature” (IVC-backed, GVC-backed or SYNDbacked companies), we performed a one-to-one propensity score matching without replacement in the year of the first VC investment to match each VC-backed company to a similar non-VC-backed twin firm (for applications of matching procedures in the VC literature, see e.g. Megginson and Weiss, 1991; Chemmanur et al., 2011; Puri and Zarutskie, 2012; Tian, 2012; Croce et al., 2013).15 In estimating propensity scores, we resorted to a logit model with the same model specification used by Puri and Zarutskie (2012): firm age, firm size, country and industry dummies. The only obvious difference is that we use European countries (and not US regions) as geographic controls.16 Then, we estimated two panel probit models in which the dependent variables are the likelihood of a positive exit and the likelihood of a negative exit, respectively. We used the same model specification as shown in Eq. (1). The results are shown in Table 6 (columns III and IV) and are in line with those exposed in Table 4 (columns II and IV). As regards the likelihood of a positive exit, the impact of IVC-backing is positive and statistically significant (at $1\\%$ ). In the same way, SYND-backing has a positive and statistically significant (at $5\\%$ ) effect. As in Table 4, the Wald test does not reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two coefficients, even though the magnitude of SYNDbacking is greater than that of IVC-backing. The impact of GVC-backing is still negligible. Also in this case, the size and the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate do not exert any impact. As regards negative exits (column IV), there is no impact of IVC-backing and GVC-backing per se. However, there is a positive impact of SYNDbacking on firm liquidation (significant at $5\\%$ ). This represents the only exception when comparing these results with those shown in Table 4. As in Table 4, the likelihood of firm liquidation is impacted negatively by the yearly number of VC investors (statistical significance at $1\\%$ ） and positively by the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate (statistical significance at $5\\%$  \n\n# [Table 6 around here]  \n\nFifth, we resorted to an Instrumental Variables (IV) approach. More specifically, we estimated two pooled IV linear probability models (for a similar procedure, see Cornelli et al., 2013) with standard errors clustered at portfolio company-level in which the dependent variables are the likelihood of a positive exit and the likelihood of a negative exit, respectively.17 We have two sets of covariates included in first-stage equations, where these equations capture the three possible VC-backing statuses of entrepreneurial firms (IVC-, GVC- and SYND-backing): i) a set of control variables which are also included in second-stage equations; and ii) a set of exclusion restrictions which are not included in second-stage equations. The control variables are: country dummies, industry dummies  (2-digit SIC), year dummies, Age, $A g e^{2}$ ,Bubble, TimeFromVC, Size, ProfitMargin, PatentStock. The exclusion restrictions are: an industry-level (3-digit SIC code) indicator on the importance of universities and higher education institutes as sources of external knowledge, calculated as the average value reported by the small firms (with less than 250 employees) that participated in the Innovation Benchmarking Survey jointly administered by the University of Cambridge and the Massachusetts  \n\nInstitute of Technology in 2004 (Science); two industry-level (3-digit SIC code) indicators reflecting the effectiveness of formal (registration of design, trademarks, patents, confidentiality agreements, copyright) and informal (secrecy, complexity of design, lead-time advantage on competitors） mechanisms to protect innovation, calculated as the average values reported by the small firms (with less than 250 employees) that participated in the Innovation Benchmarking Survey jointly administered by the University of Cambridge and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2004 (Formal, Informal); the ratio between government expenditures and GDP at country-level at time t-1 (GovExp_GDP: source: Eurostat); the IVC fundraising at country-level at time t-1 (IVC_fundraising: source: Thomson One), winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles; the overall equity capital invested at country-level at time t-1 (Equity: source: Thomson One), winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles; the GDP growth at country-level between time t and time t-1 (GDP_Growth; source: World Bank); the real GDP at country-level at time t-1 (GDP; source: World Bank), deflated by using the consumer price index (year 2005 is the reference year; source: Eurostat); and a dummy that equals 1 in the post-bubble period for ICT investments (PostBubble_ICT). It is worth noting that we employed this fifth identification strategy to estimate our baseline model (Table 4, columns I and II), because of the difficulty to find exclusion restrictions which acted as instruments for VC size and VC diversity. The results are shown in Table 6 (columns V and VI) and are in line with those exposed in Table 4. As regards the likelihood of a positive exit (column V), the impact of IVC-backing is positive and statistically significant (at $10\\%$ ). In the same way, SYND-backing has a positive and statistically significant (at $10\\%$ ) effect. As in Table 4, the Wald test does not reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the coefficients of SYND-backing and IVC-backing. GVC-backing does not exert a statistically significant impact. As regards negative exits (column VI), there is still no impact of VC-backing, whatever the type of VC-backing. In the last rows of Table 6 (columns V and VI), we reported the F statistics related to the first-stage regressions of the IV procedure. Whatever the dependent variable at the second-stage, in each first-stage regression the null hypothesis of weak instruments is rejected: the conventional threshold of 10 (Staiger and Stock, 1997) is always passed.  \n\n#### 5.3. Legal and Institutional Issues  \n\nIn our main estimations (Table 4, columns IlI and IV), we do not account for legal and institutional differences across countries and over time. However, the countries included in the VICO dataset are very different with respect to accounting conservatism, accounting disclosure, debt enforcement, regulation of entry, procedural formalism of dispute resolution and property protection rights, and creditor rights. In unreported regressions, we removed the country dummies from our main estimations and added the following country-level variables: i) an index of accounting conservatism, provided by Cumming and Walz (2010; Country Earnings Aggressiveness Index in their Table I); ii) a measure of accounting disclosure in private firms, provided by Cumming and Walz (2010; Private Firm Accounting Indices in their Table I); i) an efficiency index of debt enforcement, provided by Djankov et al. (2008; Efficiency in their Table 2); iv) three indexes of regulation of entry, provided by Djankov et al. (2002; Number of procedures, Time, and Cost in their Table II): number of procedures, time and costs that start-ups must bear before starting their operations; v) an index of procedural formalism of dispute resolution, provided by Djankov et al. (2003; Formalism index in their Table IIb); and vi) an index aggregating creditor rights, provided by Djankov et al. (2007; Creditor rights in their Table 1). We also considered other indices from La Porta et al. (1998). Whichever the country-level variable employed, the results mirror those exposed in Table 4, in terms of both sign and magnitude. The impact of each country-level variable is fully in line with the evidence shown in the most relevant works in the literature on accounting. financial economics, economics, and political economy.  \n\nFurthermore, as shown in Table 1, the countries with the highest percentage of IVCbacked and GVC-backed companies are the UK and Spain, respectively. In 2010, the stock market capitalization/GDP ratio is about $85\\%$ in Spain, while it is $136\\%$ in the UK. Therefore, everything else being equal, an entrepreneurial firm should have a lower likelihood of becoming public in Spain than in the UK. Given that IPO is one of the two indicators of positive exit, we should check if a different degree of development of financial markets could be responsible for our findings. To test this, from our main estimations (Table 4, columns MII and IV) we removed the country dummies and year dummies and added the country-level ratio between the stock market capitalization and the GDP at time t (source: World Bank; time period: 1991-2010). Also in this case, the results are fully in line with those shown in Table 4.  \n\nLastly, during the time period of our study, the European countries included in the VICO dataset started with national laws that were quite different, but then such laws have been slowly converging because of the European Union convergence. Thus, from our main estimations (Table 4, columns IlI and IV) we removed the country dummies and year dummies and added an index of economic integration/convergence within the European Union at time t available for the countries included in the VICO dataset in the period 1999-2010, provided by Konig and Ohr (2013; Overall integration in their Table 2). Alternatively, from our main estimations (Table 4, columns MI and IV) we substituted the country dummies and year dummies with their cross-products. As above, whichever the model specification employed, the results are almost the same as those shown in Table 4. All estimates are available upon request from the authors.  \n\n#### 5.4. Robustness Checks  \n\nWe performed several checks to test the robustness of our econometric results. Even though a multinomial logit approach is the most common choice in the literature on VC and exit (see Section 4), this methodology shows some weaknesses. First, multinomial logit models hinge on a strong assumption: the irrelevance of independent alternatives (IIA). To solve this problem, we estimated a multinomial probit regression with the same model specification as shown in Eq. (1). The results are shown in Table 7 (columns I and I). It is worth noting that we report the estimated coefficients (instead of the relative-risk ratios as in Table 4). In column I, as to the variables of interest (IVC, GVC, SYND, VC size, VC diversity), the results are fully in line with those exposed in Table 4. The impact of IVC-backing is still positive and statistically significant (at $1\\%$ ) on the likelihood of a positive exit, as well as the impact of SYND-backing. This latter is statistically significant at $5\\%$ and its magnitude is higher than that of IVC-backing. As in our main results, the Wald test does not reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two coefficients of IVC and SYND. The impact of GVC-backing on a positive exit is still negligible. These results on positive exit are not found to be influenced by syndicate size and institutional heterogeneity. As regards negative exits, in column II we see that VCbacking has no impact, whatever the type of VC-backing. However, as in Table 4: i) the higher is the yearly number of VC investors backing the focal portfolio company, the lower appears the likelihood of a liquidation (significant at $5\\%$ ); i) the higher is the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate, the higher is the likelihood of a liquidation (significant at $1\\%$  \n\n# [Table 7 around here]  \n\nSecond, even though we clustered the standard errors at portfolio company-level, our pooled multinomial logit models might not take properly into account the panel nature of our dataset. So, we estimated two semi-parametric Cox-type survival models, in which the dependent variables are the hazard rate of a positive exit and the hazard rate of a negative exit, respectively. Firm age is the random variable to define the time of 'death' (i.e., first exit in a competing risk scenario). The choice to model non parametrically the hazard rates is due to their non-monotonic shape. As a matter of fact, the two hazard rates of positive and negative exits are increasing in the first years since firm foundation and then decreasing with firm age (see Figure 1 for positive exits and Figure 2 for negative exits).18 The results are shown in Table 7 (columns III and IV) and are quite in line with those exposed in Table 4. As regards positive exits (column Il), the impact of IVCbacking is positive and statistically significant (at $1\\%$ ), as well as the impact of SYNDbacking (significant at $5\\%$ ). In this case, the magnitude of IVC-backing is slightly greater than that of SYND-backing. The impact of GVC-backing is still positive (as in Table 4) but weakly significant (at $10\\%$ ). Also in this case, results on positive exit are not influenced by syndicate size and institutional heterogeneity. As regards negative exits (column IV), there is no impact of VC-backing per se. However, as in our main results, the yearly number of VC investors lowers the likelihood of a liquidation (statistical significance at $5\\%$ )． And, the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate positively impacts on the likelihood of a liquidation (statistical significance at $1\\%$ 0. Finally, we performed other four robustness tests/sensitivity analyses. First, we substituted the variable Bubble with the variable Bubble 1998-2000. As shown in Table 8 (columns I and I), the results are almost unchanged. More interestingly, the impact of the time of the first VC investment is still negligible. Second, we tried alternative measures of operating performance. In Table 8, we substituted the variable ProfitMargin with: i) the ratio between the difference of sales value and payroll expenses and sales value (columns III and IV); ii) the ratio between EBITDA and total assets (columns V and VI); i) the ratio between EBITDA and sales (columns VII and VII); and iv) ROA - given by the ratio between net income and total assets - (columns IX and X). Also in this case, the results are almost unchanged. It is worth noting that sales value, payroll expenses, EBITDA, total assets and net income have been deflated by the Consumer Price Index (source: Eurostat; reference year: 2005). Third, in unreported regressions we inserted: i) a dummy variable that equals 1 whether the focal young high-tech company reports a loss (negative EBIT) in the year t-1 (Chahine et al., 2012); and ii) the ratio between current assets and total assets at time t-1 (Chahine et al., 2012). Results are almost unchanged and are available upon request from the authors. Note that EBIT, current assets and total assets have been deflated by the Consumer Price Index (source: Eurostat; reference year: 2005). Finally, according to Petersen (2009), we re-estimated the standard errors of the variables included in our models through a double-clustering by country and year. Results are almost unchanged and are available upon request from the authors.  \n\n# [Table 8 around here]  \n\n### 6. Alternative Explanations  \n\nIn this Section, we test whether our results (exposed in Table 4) can be driven by: i) the (potentially different) holding period of the different types of VC investors; ii) a potential signaling effect of GVC towards IVC investors; i) the firm's financial structure and net cash-flow ratio; iv) the investment stage; and v) the distance between the VC investor and the target company.  \n\n#### 6.1. Holding Period  \n\nVC investors provide value-adding services to their portfolio companies, and such services are more valuable when VC investors are actively involved in a firm's management. As claimed by Croce et al. (2013: p. 492): \"During the holding period VCs provide help in defining strategic planning, assistance in management recruitment and compensation, access to their network of contacts (i.e. banks, suppliers and customers) and expertise in operational planning [...] all of which become valuable resources for the portfolio firm\". Hence, if different types of VC investors are characterized by different holding periods, i.e. different types of VC investors systematically hold their equity stake for different time periods, our results might be driven by our (wrong) assumption to model IVC, GVC and SYND as 3 step dummy variables which switch \"permanently\" from O to 1 after the first VC investment. For instance, the estimated strong impact of mixed IVC-GVC syndicates might be related to the longer holding period of such mixed syndicated investments than that of IVC and GVC investments.  \n\nIn order to control for this fact, we replaced the above-mentioned 3 step dummy variables (IVC, GVC, SYND) with 3 dummy variables: i) IVC_holding that equals one for the years after obtaining the first VC investment by an IVC investor until the end of the IVC investor's holding period, and zero otherwise; i) GVC_holding that equals one for the years after obtaining the first VC investment by a GVC investor until the end of the GVC investor's holding period, and zero otherwise; and i) SYND_holding that equals one for the years after obtaining the first VC investment by a mixed IVC-GVC syndicate until the end of the mixed IVC-GVC syndicate's holding period, and zero otherwise. The results are shown in Table 9 (columns I and II) and are in line with those exposed in Table 4. As regards the column I, the impact of IVC-backing is positive and statistically significant (at $5\\%$ ) on the likelihood of a positive exit. In the same way, SYND-backing has a positive and statistically significant effect (at $1\\%$ ). As in Table 4, the Wald test does not reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the coefficients of SYND-backing and IVC-backing, even though the magnitude of the former is greater than that of the latter. As in Table 4, the impact of GVC-backing, and the size and the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate exert a negligible impact on the likelihood of a positive exit. As regards the column II, there is no impact of IVC-backing and GVC-backing, but there is a negative impact of SYND-backing on firm liquidation (significant at $1\\%$ ).As in Table 4, the likelihood of firm liquidation is impacted negatively by the yearly number of  \n\nVC  investors  (statistical  significance  at $5\\%$ ） and positively by the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate (statistical significance at $1\\%$ 一  \n\n#### 6.2. Signaling  \n\nThe negligible impact of GVC investors might be due to the fact that we did not model properly the dynamics and the interactions between GVC and IVC investors. Some portfolio companies might be characterized by very high spillovers or they could be too far from the product market. In both cases, IVCs could not be interested in targeting some companies. So, GVCs might exert a signaling function (Lerner, 2002) towards IVC investors that helps such (types of) portfolio companies access capital markets.  \n\nIn order to take into account the sequence between GVC and IVC investments, we substituted the step variable GVC with two dummy variables: i) IVC_post that equals one from the year of a subsequent IVC investment, which occurs after the first GVC investment, and zero otherwise; and i) GVC_pre that equals one for the years after obtaining the first VC investment by a GVC investor until the (potential) receipt of a subsequent IVC investment, and zero otherwise. The results are shown in Table 9 (columns II and IV) and are in line with those exposed in Table 4. As regards the positive exits (column Ml), the impact of IVC-backing is still positive and statistically significant (at $1\\%$ ). Also SYND-backing exerts a positive and statistically significant (at $5\\%$ ) effect, and its magnitude is greater than that associated with the coefficient of IVCbacking. Also in this case, when performing a Wald test, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the coefficients of SYND-backing and IVC-backing. Even after splitting GVC-backing to control for (potential) subsequent IVC investments, the impact of GVC-backing is still negligible.19 As in Table 4, the size and the composition of the syndicate exert a negligible impact on the likelihood of a positive exit. As regards the negative exits (column IV), there is no impact of VC-backing, whatever the type (and the potential sequence) of VC-backing. As in Table 4, the yearly number of VC investors exerts a negative impact on the likelihood of firm liquidation (statistical significance at $5\\%$ ) and the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate positively impacts the likelihood of a negative exit (statistical significance at $1\\%$  \n\n#### 6.3. Financial Structure and Cash-Flow Ratio  \n\nINUw we cosiuti uie imautiai suuetuit vi puiuou copames. l ulititnt types u1 VC investors systematically choose companies which show different financial structures and/or net cash-flow ratios, i.e. GVC investors choose portfolio companies with more/less availability of capital and/or investment opportunities, our results exposed in Table 4 might be misleading. To some extent, we added to our model specification - eq. (1) - two additional variables: i) the ratio between short-term debt and total assets at time t-1 (DTA); i) the ratio between net cash flow and total assets at time t-1 (NCFTA). When computing DTA, we used short-term debt because our sample is composed of young high-tech companies, and the majority of this debt is represented by bank loans. Companies with a low value of DTA may suffer from external capital constraints because of their high information asymmetries towards financial markets (Carpenter and Petersen, 2002), and thus some profitable investments cannot be pursued. As to NCFTA, it should capture the investment rate of young high-tech companies. In fact, the investment rate of this type of companies is strongly correlated with their net cash-flow (Bertoni et al., 2010). The results are shown in Table 10 (columns I and I) and are in line with those exposed in Table 4. In column I, we see that the impact of IVC-backing is positive and statistically significant (at $1\\%$ ) on the likelihood of a positive exit. Also SYND-backing exerts a positive and statistically significant (very close to $5\\%$ ) effect, and its magnitude is greater than that associated with the coefficient of IVC-backing. As in Table 4, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the coefficients of SYNDbacking and IVC-backing. The impact of GVC-backing is still negligible. As in Table 4, the size and the composition of the syndicate exert a negligible impact on the likelihood of a positive exit. Conversely, we find a positive and statistically significant effect (at $1\\%$ of $D T A$ on the likelihood of a positive exit. As regards the negative exits (column I), there is no impact of all types of VC-backing. As in Table 4, the yearly number of VC investors exerts a negative impact on the likelihood of firm liquidation (statistical significance at $5\\%$ ) and the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate positively impacts the likelihood of a negative exit (statistical significance at $1\\%$ ). In this case, the impact of DTA is negligible. The impact of NCFTA is always negligible, whatever the exit type, even though the sign of the coefficient is the opposite: negative for positive exits and positive for firm liquidations.  \n\n#### 6.4. Investment Stage  \n\nOur results in Table 4 might be driven by the stage of the investments engaged by different (types of) VC investors. If the different types of VC investors systematically choose companies in different stages of their life and there is a (positive or negative) correlation between the investment stage and the likelihood of a positive/negative exit, our main results could be biased. In order to control for this potential source of endogeneity (i.e., investment stage is an omitted variable), we inserted a dummy variable (Earlystage) that equals one for the companies which obtained the first VC investment in the first two years after firm foundation, and zero otherwise. This variable is set to zero for all non VC-backed companies. The results are shown in Table 10 (columns II and IV) and are in line with those exposed in Table 4. As regards the likelihood of a positive exit, both the impacts of IVC-backing and SYND-backing are positive and statistically significant (at $1\\%$ ). The magnitude of the latter is greater than that of IVC-backing, but we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two coefficients. The impact of GVC-backing is still negligible, as well as the size and the composition of the syndicate. As regards the negative exits (column IV), there is no impact of VC-backing, whatever the type of VC investor. Still, the yearly number of VC investors exerts a negative impact (statistically significant at $5\\%$ ), while the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate positively impacts the likelihood of firm liquidation (statistical significance at $1\\%$ ). The impact of the investment stage is always positive but negligible, whatever the exit type.  \n\n#### 6.5. Distance  \n\nFinally we control for the distance between the VC investors and portfolio companies. VC investors prefer to target portfolio companies which are located closer (Lerner, 1995). This way, it is easier for VC investors monitor portfolio companies and perform their value-adding activities. So, as suggested by Sorensen (2007), distance is not independent of the investment outcome. Also in this case, if the different types of VC investors systematically choose companies at a certain distance from their headquarters and there is an alleged positive/negative correlation between the distance and the likelihood of a positive/negative exit, our results in Table 4 could be biased. In order to control for this potential omitted variable bias, we inserted a continuous variable (Distance) that measures the geographic distance between the lead investor of the first VC investment and the target company (in kilometers). This variable is set to zero for all non VC-backed companies.20 The results are shown in Table 10 (columns $\\mathrm{v}$ and VI and are in line with those exposed in Table 4. As regards the likelihood of a positive exit (column V), the impact of IVC-backing is positive and statistically significant at $1\\%$ . While, the impact of SYND-backing is positive and statistically significant (at $5\\%$ ), and shows a magnitude greater than that of IVC-backing. Also in this case, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two coefficients. The impact of GVC-backing is still negligible, as well as the size and the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate. As regards the negative exits (column VI), there is no impact of all types of VC-backing. Still, the yearly number of VC investors exerts a negative impact (statistically significant at $5\\%$ ), while the composition of the syndicate has a positive and statistically significant impact (at $1\\%$ ). The impact of the distance is always negligible, whatever the exit type, even though the sign of the coefficient is the opposite: positive for positive exits and negative for firm liquidations.  \n\n### 7. Concluding Remarks  \n\nPrior research indicates that different types of VC investors have a different impact on the performance of their portfolio companies. Despite the high presence of GVC funds in Europe, there is a dearth of contributions evaluating the performance of this specific type of investor. In this work, using a large representative sample of European VC-backed and non-VC backed companies observed from 1991 to 2010, we have compared the exit performance of GVC investors with the one of IVC funds and mixed IVC-GVC syndicates, controlling for the yearly size and institutional heterogeneity of the syndicates.  \n\nOur econometric results show that IVC-backed companies have a higher likelihood to reach a positive exit (IPO or trade-sale) than GVC-backed ones. More interestingly, mixed IVC-GVC syndicated investments lead to a higher (but not statistically different) likelihood of a positive exit than that of IVC-backing. This positive impact of IVC-GVC syndicates is not found to be influenced by the composition of the syndicate in terms of size and institutional heterogeneity. Our findings are robust to several robustness checks - controlling for endogeneity concerns, selection bias, omitted variables bias, legal and institutional differences across countries and over time through several econometric techniques - and alternative explanations.  \n\nThese results have important policy implications. First, our analysis sheds a negative light on the “go it alone” strategy of the European GVC funds. In doing so, our study defines precise boundaries on the role of the State as active venture capitalist. In fact, there is a positive economically and statistically relevant effect on the exit performance of young high-tech companies when governmental bodies syndicate with IVCs, whichever the size and the composition of the syndicate. Fortunately, recent European policy initiatives (e.g., the EU framework programme “Horizon 2020\") seem to go exactly this way through the pursuit of public-private partnerships. Our findings totally support this view.  \n\nHowever, our findings also contain a warning for the set-up of this typology of partnerships. In fact, echoing Chahine et al. (2012), our results indicate that the increase of the institutional heterogeneity in VC syndicates may increase the odds of portfolio companies’ liquidation. This is consistent with the fact that heterogeneous investors have different objectives which may lead to principal-principal conflicts (Colombo et al., 2014). Therefore, if IVC-GVC syndicates are found to be beneficial on the one side (i.e., favoring an exit through an IPO or a trade sale), the government and the independent venture capital investor should always remind to keep the institutional heterogeneity of the syndicate at a manageable level in order to limit negative side-effects.  \n\nTo conclude, this work aimed at offering a general assessment on the performance of GVCs and IVCs and their syndicated activities in the European VC market. Of course, much remains to be investigated and several research directions might be undertaken. For example, future research could deepen the diversity among VC syndicate members, exploring different dimensions than the institutional one investigated here. An interesting element to bring into the analysis could be the reputation of VC syndicate members.  \n\nFurthermore, the heterogeneity of the GVC funds across European countries could be explored in terms of sources of financing, internal organization, objectives and selection of portfolio companies. This way, it would be possible to further understand the conditions under which GVCs play an important role for the development of the VC market.  \n\n## Acknowledgements  \n\nFinancial support from the VICO project financed under the 7th European Framework Programme (Grant agreement no. 217485) is gratefully acknowledged.

We distinguish two types of uncertainty that firms face when considering novel investments: egocentric, pertaining to making the right decisions, and altercentric, pertaining to being evaluated as a potential partner on the investment. Whereas the former increases the firm's need to syndicate the investment, the latter reduces the firm's opportunity to do so, making it contingent upon the firm's status and reputation for atracting potential partners. Using data on first-round venture capital investments, we find that novel investments are more likely to be syndicated. Moreover, this relationship is stronger for firms with higher status and weaker for firms with higher reputation. These results highlight a relational aspect of uncertainty, inherent in a particular VC firm - investment dyad, and suggest that status and reputation play different roles in aligning the need and opportunity to syndicate novel investments.  \n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nFor firms to form alliances, it is necessary for them to have both the need and opportunity to do so. This is equally valid in the context of venture capital syndications and we focus on how the need and opportunity for syndication align in the context of specific investments. While prior research has focused on the uncertainty characterizing a specific investment target (e.g. early stage or high technology) as a driver for syndication, we argue that such uncertainty need not be perceived uniformly among potential investors. Certain investments may be more or less uncertain to different VC firms, based on the extent of their prior experience in the specific industry of the investment. We thus focus on a hitherto unexplored, relational aspect of uncertainty, inherent in a particular VC firm - investment dyad and reflecting the VC firm's understanding of the particular company and its environment.  \n\nIn view of this, the need and opportunity to syndicate a particular investment may not always be aligned: in certain situations - such as when the investment is novel to the VC firm - the factors that increase the firm's need to seek partners may also reduce the opportunity for the firm to find and attract needed partners. Such misalignment is related to the presence of two different types of uncertainty. On one hand, a VC firm faces (egocentric) uncertainty related to the proper decisions to be made in  \n\nselecting and managing these investments. In such cases, the firm can benefit from the participation of syndicate partners and is thus likely to seek such partners. Yet, on the other hand, for these very same investments, it is difficult for potential syndicate partners to evaluate the focal VC firm as a worthy partner (altercentric uncertainty). In such cases, the opportunity for syndication is contingent upon the VC firm's ability to signal its quality to potential partners, such as through its status and reputation.  \n\nTo test these theoretical insights, we studied 35,757 first-round investments made by 2,498 US VC firms between 1980 and 2004. We considered an investment to be novel to the involved VC firm to the extent that it was in an industry in which the VC firm had limited or no prior experience. Consistent with our theoretical expectations, we found that novel investments were more likely to be syndicated. In addition, we found that the VC firm's status and reputation provided important nuances to this relationship. Status reinforced the relationship: VC firms with higher status are much more likely to form syndicates as the novelty of the investment increases. In contrast, and contrary to our expectations, VC firms with higher reputation exhibited a reduced likelihood for syndicating novel projects.  \n\nOur study suggests that need and opportunity, rather than being independent aspects of syndication and alliance formation, are in fact intertwined at the level of the projects for which firms may seek to form alliances. We provide an enriched understanding of the uncertainty residing in the relationship between a VC firm and the specific investments it undertakes. By their nature, novel investments involve domains in which the firm lacks sufficient knowledge and thus make the firm's need for alliance partners more salient. Yet, undertaking such investments can serve as a red flag for the firm's quality as a partner for these projects due to its uncertain ability to make project-specific contributions, which ultimately undermines its ability to attract partners for these investments. Potential partners, unable to assess the potential contribution of the focal firm, have to rely on their overall perceptions of the firm in deciding whether to join forces with it on such projects. While they both affect these overall perceptions, the firm's status and reputation exhibit different strengths and relevance as quality signals for novel projects. Reputation, anchored in the firm's prior activities and performance, may not be easily carried over to a new domain. In contrast, status - dissociated from specific behavior and grounded in existing relationships and affliations - provides more resilience to firms in such uncertain situations.  \n\nRelated to practice, our work suggests that in considering investments into unfamiliar or less familiar industries, VC managers need to be aware that, to the extent that they look for potential syndicate partners, such partners are less likely to be swayed by the firm's prior track record and more by its prior associations. More broadly, our results suggest to managers that tradition and past successes can be discounted when looking to attract partners for novel projects and that, to the extent there is continuous pressure to look for new opportunities, careful attention needs to be paid to the cultivation of relationships that can make such opportunities more accessible.  \n\n## 2. Introduction  \n\nInter-firm alliances represent an important topic for organizational research and significant research effort has been extended to understand why they occur. Put concisely, firms form alliances when they need additional resources or when they have the opportunity to know and atract potential partners (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1996). The former stems from a vulnerable strategic position (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1996), lack of adequate knowledge (De Clercq and Dimov, 2008) or quest for legitimacy (Baum and Oliver, 1992; Stuart, Hoang and Hybels, 199). The latter is afforded by possession of network resources (Gulati, 1999) or a strong position in the market space (Stuart, 1998).  \n\nWhile prior literature has largely focused on the firms' overall tendencies to form alliances as explained by market conditions (Kogut, 1988), industry competition (Gimeno, 2004), firm attributes (Chung, Singh and Lee, 2000), or some combination of these (e.g. Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1996; Koza and Lewin, 1998; Park, Chen and Gallagher, 2002), there has been limited consideration of the nature of specific projects for which alliances are formed. This is unfortunate, because it is at the project level that needs are assessed, partners' contributions to the alliance are evaluated (Doz and Hamel, 1998), alliance governance structure is determined (Casciaro, 2003), and the project's outcomes for partners are appraised. Moreover, it is at this level that the need and opportunity for alliance formation are intertwined in ways that cannot be anticipated by existing theory. On one hand, firms with plentiful opportunities to form alliances may not necessarily need such alliances for particular projects. On the other hand, firms in need of partners for particular projects may find it hard to find or attract partners for those projects. Hence, project considerations are important to the extent that they affect the firm's decision to seek partners and the prospective partners' decision to enter an alliance.  \n\nIndividual-project considerations are particularly potent in the context of the venture capital (VC) industry, where a substantial proportion of investments are made by syndicate partnerships involving two or more VC firms (Bygrave, 1987; Lerner, 1994; Manigart et al., 2006). In addition to its benefits for the management of the VC firm's total portfolio - such as diversification, sharing financial risk, and increasing deal flow (Lockett and Wright, 2001; Manigart et al., 2006; Norton and Tennenbaum, 1993; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001) - syndication can also be instrumental for the selection and management of individual investments by affording the VC firm access to wider knowledge and skill sets (Brander, Amit, and Antweiler, 2002; Bygrave, 1987; De Clercq and Dimov, 2008; Lerner, 1994). Indeed, research has shown that when investing in companies that are highly innovative (Bygrave, 1988) or less established (Locket et al., 2002), VC firms tend to seek syndicate partners in order to deal with the uncertainty encompassing such projects. Yet, implicit in this work is the notion that the uncertainty residing in the specific investment targets is uniformly perceived among potential investors, regardless of their own characteristics or experiences. Questioning this premise reveals a hitherto unexplored relational aspect of uncertainty, inherent in a particular VC firm - company dyad, which accounts for the different understanding that various VC firms may have of the specific company and its environment. This raises the question of the considerations and factors that propel and enable particular VC firms to syndicate particular investment projects.  \n\nAccordingly, this study seeks to understand the syndication of individual investments as a function of the VC firm's need and opportunity to do so. We relate these factors to the degree of novelty that the investment represents for the VC firm and distinguish between two types of uncertainty that emerge from such novelty: egocentric, pertaining to the focal firm's uncertainty about the decisions to be made for the investment to succeed, and altercentric, pertaining to uncertainty that external parties face in judging the quality of the focal firm as a potential partner on the project (Podolny, 2001). Whereas egocentric uncertainty increases the firm's need to syndicate the project, altercentric uncertainty reduces the opportunity to do so and renders the attraction of partners dependent on the firm's ability to signal its quality to external parties, such as through its status and reputation (Podolny, 1993; Jensen and Roy, 2008; Washington and Zajac, 2005). Therefore, we expect not only that VC firms facing novel projects wil be more prone to syndicate them, but also that such syndication will be more opportune for firms with high status or reputation. Studying 35,757 first-round investments made by 2,498 VC firms over the 1980-2004 period, we find that the likelihood of syndication increases with the novelty of the investment and that this relationship is stronger for firms with high status and, contrary to our expectations, weaker for firms with high reputation.  \n\nWe aim to make several contributions to the existing literature. First, we develop a hitherto lacking understanding of the nature and interplay between need and opportunity in aliance formation and VC syndication. Our focus on the level at which syndication decisions are made - the individual project - allows us to capture uncertainty that is specific to the firm-project dyad and that fuels two opposing forces on the likelihood of syndication. By emphasizing that seemingly similar projects in fact may not produce the same need for syndication to different VC firms, we extend current literature on VC syndication that primarily focused on the nature of the project per se without acknowledging the factors that make such a project more or less uncertain for an individual VC firm. Second, we show that the very projects that create a need for syndication may also keep prospective partners at bay unless the focal firm can signal its quality to them. This expands the conception of uncertainty under which status matters for the formation of partnerships. Finally, this study adds to our understanding of the distinct roles that organizations' status and reputation have in alliance formation (Jensen and Roy,  \n\n2008) and venture capital investing (Dimov, Shepherd, and Sutcliffe, 2007). Our results suggest that the social and economic components of quality signals differ in their transferability to novel domains and thus in their potency to mitigate the altercentric uncertainty associated with novel projects.  \n\n## 3. Syndication and Uncertainty  \n\nVC syndication arises when at least two VC firms invest in the same company in the same investment round (Bygrave 1987, Lerner 1994). As such, syndication represents a voluntary,long-term commitment by a VC firm to a cooperative relationship in which the participating firms share risks and exchange knowledge and resources (Wright and Locket, 2003). Hence, a syndicate closely resonates to a traditional definition of strategic alliances, which are conceptualized as voluntarily initiated inter-fim cooperative agreements that involve contributions by partners reflected in exchange, sharing or codevelopment of capital, technology, knowledge or other firm-specific assets (Gulati, 1995b). Indeed, we know that alliances and syndicates carry similar benefits for firms seeking fast access to complementary assets (Bygrave, 1987; Brander et al., 2002; Deeds and Hill, 1996; Parkhe, 1993), financial resources (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1996; Lockett and Wright, 2001) or valuable external knowledge (De Clercq and Dimov, 2008; Grant and Baden-Fuller, 2004).  \n\nIn this regard, alliances are more sought out -- and thus more likely to form -- when the firm has a vulnerable strategic position derived from operating in unpredictable markets or undertaking risky strategies (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1996). This is consistent with resource dependence theory (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), which considers alliances as mechanisms for coping with various types of uncertainty. Indeed, the use of alliances increases when firms face environmental (Dickson and Weaver, 1997) or, more specificall, market (Beckman et al., 2004) or industry (Gimeno, 2004) uncertainty. Similarly, a general propensity to syndicate has been related to the VC firms' intent to reduce uncertainties stemming from threats of potential new entrants (Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu, 2007) or the intent to manage the uncertainty residing in their porfolios (Manigart et al., 2006).  \n\nAt the porfolio level, consistent with arguments from financial theory, syndication enables the VC firm to diversify its portfolio and reduce financial risk (Lockett and Wright, 2001; Manigart et al., 2006; Norton and Tennenbaum, 1993). In addition, reciprocity in syndication often provides a mechanism for accessing promising deals in the future (Lerner, 1994; Manigart et al., 2006; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001) and thus reduces uncertainty about the quality of future portfolios. Similarly, to reduce uncertainties related to fundraising, VC firms are known to syndicate in order to “window dress\" their portfolios by investing in later-stage deals that are more likely to succeed (Lerner, 1994).  \n\nNotwithstanding the importance of understanding how uncertainty influences the firms' general propensity to form alliances or syndicates, we argue that understanding the formation of specific syndicates requires a more granular consideration of the uncertainty inherent to the specific project for which syndication is sought. Specifically, although macro or porfolio considerations can dictate certain level of syndication across the VC firm's investments, they are generally not as useful in explaining whether a particular deal wilbe syndicated (Manigart et al., 2006), and cannot foretell whether the firm has the need or opportunity to syndicate the deal. Accordingly, to tease out the need/opportunity interplay in syndicate formation, we focus on uncertainty at the individual project level1.  \n\nIn the VC industry, and especially in the US context, managing the uncertainty surrounding specific investments is an important motive for syndication (Manigart et al., 2006). Syndication can help reduce uncertainty related to the investment selection decision, as having more VC firms to evaluate a potential deal and perform due diligence is likely to enhance the selection process (Lerner, 1994). Aditionally, beyond investment selection, syndication can reduce the uncertainty related to managing and adding value to the particular company (Brander et al., 2002). It enables the VC firm to access complementary knowledge and skills from its syndicate partners (Bygrave, 1987; De Clercq and Dimov, 2008), which is especially important in early-stage projects and first-round investments when investors face higher uncertainty due to the venture's uncertified quality (Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir, 1996). Indeed, prior research confirms that early stage deals are more likely to be syndicated despite their lower financial requirements (Bygrave, 1987; Lockett et al., 2002).  \n\nTo the extent that extant research has characterized uncertainty as residing in the specific investment target - as exemplified by the case of an early-stage or high-technology company - there is an implicit assumption that such uncertainty will be uniformly perceived by potential investors and will induce equal need for syndication. Relaxing this assumption and acknowledging that VC firms can vary in their need and opportunity to syndicate specific projects offers an opportunity to develop more precise arguments for VC syndication. To do so requires a more refined notion of uncertainty that captures its relational aspects, i.e. those residing in the specific VC firm - investment dyad and reflecting the VC firm's (lack of) knowledge relevant to the deal at hand.  \n\n### 3.1. Investment Novelty as a Source of Uncertainty  \n\nMost broadly, the uncertainty associated with a given project (investment) pertains to the difficulty that the potential investor faces in anticipating and managing the project payoffs. While some of that dificulty is truly exogenous (and thus common to all potential investors), part of it is investor specific, related to the investor's experience and understanding of the project at hand. Within VC firms, the investment decisions, monitoring and value adding activities are essentially performed by the firm's management team (Guler, 2007). Typically, that team changes only gradually over time, thereby creating relatively stable collective experience within the firm. Group experience and learning lead to distinct benefits such as shared knowledge and mindset, coordination routines, and collective memory (Zhao, Anand, and Mitchell, 2004). For example, based on their prior experience, the VC frm managers engage in group discussions, make joint interpretations and draw collective inferences about the type of strategies and managerial skills that work in various competitive situations, the effectiveness of different approaches in interacting with the porfolio company managers, and the roles that different stakeholders play in the development of the porfolio company. Therefore, although individual partners bring prior personal experience to the management team, their collective experience within the firm carries substantial weight in investment decisions and it is this firm-level experience on which we focus To the extent that a potential investment is novel to the VC firm, i.e. it is based in an industry in which the VC firm has made no or just few investments previously it represents a high degree of uncertainty that is specific to the VC firm and that, if not mitigated, can undermine the firm's success with that investment (De Clercq and Dimov, 2008; Dimov and De Clercq, 2006).  \n\nConceptualized this way, a novel investment poses a double challenge for the VC firm. On one hand, it is difficult for the firm to identify and select the best strategy to follow in order to achieve the desired outcomes for the project. At the same time, it is difficult for a third party to appraise the VC firm as a potential partner for the project since its past experience and performance can offer little guidance given the novel nature of the project to the firm. These challenges invoke Podolny's (2001) distinction of two types of uncertainty that VC firms face in undertaking specific projects. Egocentric uncertainty pertains to the focal firm's (or ego's) lack of knowledge of the best or most appropriate approach to achieve the desired project goal. Accordingly, egocentric uncertainty prevails when firms engage in activities that are novel to them (e.g. March, 1991), as their own experience may provide insufficient guidance. In the VC context, egocentric uncertainty captures the VC firm's doubt about the proper or best operational, personnel, or strategic decisions to be made in order to spur company development and reach a stage where the investment can be exited on favorable terms.  \n\nAltercentric uncertainty pertains to the difficulty that external parties (or the firm's relevant \"alters\") have in appraising the quality of the focal firm. Although such actor-related uncertainty can be pertinent for any of the firm's stakeholders, in the context of strategic alliances and syndicates, the relevant alters are the firm's prospective alliance partners who need to evaluate the focal firm as an exchange partner (Doz and Hamel, 1998; Sorenson & Stuart, 2008). More specifically, prospective partners need to determine whether the inputs contributed to the partnership by the focal firm would be of desired quality (Stuart, 1998), whether the focal firm possesses the knowledge and resources that the partner seeks (De Clercq and Dimov, 2008; Geringer, 1988), or whether it could be trusted in the subsequent interactions between firms (Ring and Van De Ven, 1992). Altercentric uncertainty is especially prominent when information about the focal firm is hard or costly to obtain as well as when the firm's performance is complex to evaluate (Podolny, 2005).  \n\nThese arguments suggest that novel investments considered by VC firms are laden with both ego- and alter-centric uncertainty. On one hand, because such investments involve industries in which the VC firm has not invested before, the VC firm cannot rely on its past investment experience and thus faces uncertainty as to how to appraise and manage these investments. On the other hand, given the information opacity inherent in relating the firm's prior experience to a current, novel investment, it is hard for an external observer to appraise the ability of a VC firm to properly supervise and contribute to the development of the company. As we elaborate below, these two types of uncertainty affect respectively the VC firm's need and opportunity for syndicating the investment at hand.  \n\n### 3.2. Egocentric Uncertainty and the Need for Syndication  \n\nWith novel projects, firms may lack an elaborate, rigorous understanding of the decisions to be made, the steps to be taken, or the resources to be deployed in pursuing these opportunities. Though VC firms can leverage their general experience when it comes to procedural isues and basic activities, such as structuring the deal, providing follow-on funding or planning an exit, the success of the investment is contingent on the VC firm's understanding and responding to the competitive dynamics and market development inherent in the specific industry as well as on its network of contacts in that industry. In this regard, to the extent that building relevant knowledge internally is a complex, timeconsuming process (Nonaka, 1994) and acquiring it externally can be costly (Lane and Lubatkin, 1998), VC firms can resort to syndication in order to fulfill their knowledge needs related to the (novel) investment at hand. Indeed, partnerships are sought and particularly beneficial when there is an incongruence between what the firm knows and what it intends to do (De Clercq and Dimov, 2008; Grant and Baden-Fuller 2004).  \n\nExternal partners may provide not only a more diverse set of knowledge from which to devise a strategy for managing the novel project, but also a second opinion for opportunity evaluation (e.g. Lerner, 1994). In this regard, when a VC firm's own experience is not enough to allow for an accurate evaluation of the project, it is likely to seek external partners (Casamatta and Haritchabalet, 2007). Finally, sharing resources across partners may limit the focal VC firm's downside exposure in case events turn out to be unfavorable (Lockett and Wright, 1999) and allows the firm to maintain certain advantage when timing is of essence (Deeds and Hill, 1996). In summary, from a strategic need perspective, the egocentric uncertainty that arises from pursuing novel projects likely increases the focal firm's need for external partners and thus makes their syndication more likely.  \n\nHypothesis 1. The likelihood of syndication increases with the novelty of the VC investment.  \n\n### 3.3. Altercentric Uncertainty and the Opportunity for Syndication  \n\nTo the extent that a focal firm needs alliance partners for a specific project, it faces the challenge of being known to, evaluated by, and finally attractive to such partners (Beckman et al., 2004; Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1996). If information about firms were readily available, easily accessible, and easy to interpret, firms would move and interact as if in vacuum, unrestrained by social friction (Dacin, Ventresca and Beal, 1999). Yet, firms are subject to altercentric uncertainty to the extent that much information about their behavior is private, costly to acquire, and causally ambiguous when atributing particular consequences to respective actions (Podolny, 1994), as is characteristic of the VC industry. While potential syndicate partners may obtain information about their peers from specialized press or personal contacts (Sorenson and Stuart, 2008), objective, rational processing of such information is dificult due to its inferential nature and high opportunity cost of obtaining it in a timely manner and keeping it up to date. Indeed, recent research suggests that VC decision making can be systematically biased and susceptible to interorganizational perceptions and politics (Guler, 2007). Such limitations are likely to intensify in the context of altercentric uncertainty (Podolny, 2001).  \n\nIn this regard, because the success of a project is ultimately dependent on the quality of the partners' input relative to the project needs (Doz and Hamel, 1998), the attractiveness of the focal firm to others is based on whether they can directly evaluate the firm's ability to contribute to the specific project as well as on whether their more general perceptions of the focal firm can help them make positive atributions about its potential contribution to the project. While in new alliances the prospective value that each partner may ultimately bring to the alliance can be generally unclear from the outset (Doz and Hamel 1998), this issue is particularly potent when the focal firm has limited or no experience in the project domain. To the extent that the perceived value of the focal VC firm's contribution to the syndicate is too uncertain, the focal firm faces the challenge of attracting, assuring or assuaging prospective partner firms².  \n\nIn the absence of mechanisms to alleviate altercentric uncertainty, prospective partner firms may be discouraged from participating in such projects due to perceived high effort costs (Tykvova, 2007), possibility of free riding as noted in alliances (Das and Teng, 2002) and VC syndicates (Dimov and De Clercq, 2006; Wright and Lockett, 2003), or suspicion that the ultimate success of the project is to0 dependent on their own investment (Larsson, Bengtsson, Henriksson, and Sparks, 1998). More generally, the perceived lack of competence of the focal firm may undermine the prospective partners' trust (Das and Teng, 2001), increase their doubts for the successful coordination and development of the project (Gulati, Lawrence, and Puranam, 2005) as well as shake their believes regarding the synergistic potential of the project (Chung et al, 2000), and thus discourage them from joining the syndicate. The long-term nature of VC syndicates makes the issue of partner coordination especially important (Das and Teng, 2002; Lockett and Wright, 1999) as potential disagreements between partners about the project's management and development may be costly, and ultimately harm the project's success. Indeed, illustrative evidence shows that any prospects of disagreements between potential syndicate partners may prevent formation of the syndicate, despite the financial attractiveness of the deal (Walske, 2008).  \n\nIn summary, when undertaking novel projects, the very same factors that drive the need of the focal firm to seek partners may simultaneously reduce its opportunity to find and attract such partners, as they flesh out the focal firm's vulnerability with the project. Accordingly, mitigating altercentric uncertainty, and thus enhancing the focal firm's opportunity to form alliances, likely depends on the degree to which prospective partners can form positive expectations of the focal firm and its contribution to the project. This in turn depends on the focal firm's ability to signal its quality to prospective partners. Accordingly, we continue by discussing two quality signals relevant in the partner selection process: status and reputation (Jensen and Roy, 2008).  \n\n3.4. Status and Reputation as Mitigators of Altercentric Uncertainty  \n\nWhen there is uncertainty about the quality of a focal actor, external parties observe firm-level signals of the actor's underlying quality as a potential exchange partner (Podolny, 1993). The notion of perceived firm quality has been well developed in both sociology and economics (strategy) literatures through the concepts of status and reputation. Although the two terms have been often used interchangeably, status and reputation are distinct facets of organizational standing and have different consequences for organizational behavior and performance (Podolny, 2005; Jensen and Roy, 2008). Status is a sociological concept that captures a firm's social rank based on its external affliations, while reputation is an economic concept that is closely coupled with the firm's past actions and track record (Washington and Zajac, 2005). By the same token, VC firms differ in regard to both their status (Podolny, 2001) and reputation (Gompers, 1996), with each of these tapping into a different facet of the VC firm's perceived quality (Dimov, Shepherd, and Sutcliffe, 2007).  \n\n3.4.1. Firm status. From a sociological perspective,firm behavior cannot be detached from the set of social relationships in which it is embedded (Granovetter, 1985). Social relations play a key role in identifying, evaluating, and attracting alliance partners (Chung et al., 2000; Podolny, 1994). Inter-firm relational networks serve as both pipes and prisms in the market, conveying valuable information and segregating actors based on their perceived quality (Podolny, 2001). On one hand, a firm's network resources - through the information advantages they bestow or the alliance experience they reflect -- facilitate the awareness and evaluation of external partners (Gulati, 1999). On the other hand, a firm's network positions and afliations play important signaling function to potential partners when the firm's quality is hard to appraise (Podolny, 1993). The signaling function of this socially constructed network position is embodied in the notion of status.  \n\nFormally defined, status represents how centrally positioned an organization is relative to other organizations in the 0verall industry network (Jensen, 2003; Podolny, 1993, 2001; Shipilov, 2005). Hence, status is a positional element of the social structure which gives an “effective claim to social esteem in terms of positive or negative privileges\" (Weber, 1978: 305). An organization's status is influenced less by the actor's behaviors than by its relations and affiliations that involve exchange or deference (Podolny, 1993). It serves as an important signal of quality when there is general uncertainty over the quality of organizations as well as prohibitive costs of carrying out evaluative search. Status creates an uneven distribution of rewards and cost burdens among the firms in the industry, highly skewed towards high-status organizations (Benjamin and Podolny, 1999; Podolny, 1993).  \n\nIn the context of alliance formation, high status organizations enjoy many privileges, which can mitigate altercentric uncertainty and thus increase their alliance opportunities. For example, high status firms incur lower transaction costs in acquiring resources and are generally perceived as more desirable exchange partners (Podolny, 1993; 1994). In addition, status considerations delineate the set of actively considered potential partners (Jensen and Roy, 2008). For novel projects, high status organizations are likely to have an additional advantage due to their ability to leverage superior information and reach out to socially distant potential partners (Ahuja, Polidoro and Mitchell, 2004). Furthermore, status signals the firm's access to a pool of resources (Benjamin and Podolny, 1999), which may alleviate the prospective partners' concerns related to the resource demands of the project.  \n\nAs discussed above, in the VC context, facing novel investments makes syndication more desirable but it also makes it difficult for external firms to evaluate the focal firm's quality as a potential partner. In this regard, high status can give the VC firm a greater chance of atracting syndication partners for such projects (Podolny, 2001), leveraging the benefits outlined above. Having high status can facilitate VC firms' access to external expertise or recruitment of managerial talent for the companies in their portfolio. In addition, high-status VC firms have important affliations with investment banks (Gulati and Higgins, 2003), which facilitates the investment exits via IPOs or acquisitions and thus enhances their performance (Hochberg, Ljungqvist and Lu, 2007). These considerations suggest that when undertaking novel projects, higher-status VC firms can more easily soothe prospective partners' uncertainties and overcome the reduced opportunity for syndication.  \n\nHypothesis 2. The positive relationship between the novelty of a VC investment and the likelihood of its syndication is stronger for VC firms with high status than for those with low status.  \n\n3.4.2. Firm reputation. Reputation is a “perceptual representation of a company's past actions and future prospects that describe the firm's overall appeal to all its key constituents when compared to other leading rivals\" (Fombrun, 1996: 72). Thus, from an economic perspective, firms generate expectations of future behavior based on their past demonstration of the same behavior. By the same token, reputation acts as a signal for the firm's future performance based on its past performance (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Milgram and Roberts, 1982) that shapes the external audience's perceptions and expectations of the firm (Rao, 1994).  \n\nIn the VC context, the VC firm's reputation is instrumental for the evaluation and selection of syndicate partners (Lerner, 1994). As a reflection of firm's past performance, it has been shown at times to be even more important than the known characteristics of the prospective partners' resource base (Lockett and Wright, 1999). Moreover, a firm's reputation and a good track record may signal to the prospective partners the focal firm's expertise and possession of managerial abilities (Saxton, 1997). This can be especially relevant for novel projects, whereby concerns with the focal firm's unfamiiarity with the project domain may be in part mitigated by prospective partners' positive perceptions of the focal firm's general ability to successfully manage projects. As such, reputation represents one of the firm's key intangible assets that increase the firm's desirability as an alliance partner (Dollinger, Golden and Saxton, 1997; Saxton, 1997). Similar to status, reputation is also known to facilitate access to and acquisition of resources (Gompers, 1996). For example, reputation enhances the VC firm's ability to raise and invest new funds (Gompers, 1996; Siri and Tufano, 1998) as well as attract high-quality entrepreneurial companies (Hsu, 2004). Consequently, reputation is likely to shape prospective partners' beliefs about future returns (Gompers, Lerner, Blair and Heman, 1998) which, combined with the prospect for facilitated access to necessary resources, may mitigate the altercentric uncertainty associated with novel investments.  \n\nFinally, from a behavioral standpoint, reputation is important as a proxy for trustworthiness (Parkhe, 1993), which reduces potential partners' concerns regarding a potentially difficult working relationship in the syndicate (Lockett & Wright, 1999). Reputable firms are less likely to default on a deal because of their conscientiousness about the intangible value of their reputation (Rindova, Williamson, Petkova and Sever, 2005) and the resulting intent to preserve it by fair cooperative behavior. Hence, even in the light of the focal firm's inexperience with the novel project, the prospective partners' doubts regarding the potential success of the cooperation may be mitigated by their expectations that the reputable focal firm will extend a fair partnering effort to see the project succeed. In contrast, prospective partners are likely to be deflected by questionable reputation and less likely to enter exchange agreements with such firms (Hill, 1990). Therefore, when undertaking novel investments for which external investor participation is needed, reputable VC firms can signal trust and reliability that can help them overcome the arising altercentric uncertainty.  \n\nHypothesis 3. The positive relationship between the novelty of a VC investment and the likelihood of its syndication is stronger for VC firms with high reputation than for those with low reputation.  \n\n4. Data and Method  \n\nSeveral considerations of the VC industry informed the design of our study. First, venture capital investments are typically staged across diferent rounds, with the first round representing the initial infusion of capital by one or more VC firms and subsequent (follow-on) rounds occurring contingent upon the company's achievement of certain development milestones (Gompers, 1995). Second, folow-on rounds may include new investors, i.e. VC firms that have not participated in the previous investment rounds. This suggests that a given VC firm may invest in a given company several times (i.e. across several investment rounds) and that there may be other VC firms that have invested in that company prior to the focal firm's involvement. Because follow-on investment decisions are qualitatively different from initial investment decisions (Podolny, 2001) and the syndication of follow-on investments involves different motivation and strategies (Lerner, 1994; Sorenson and Stuart, 2008), we focused our study on first-round investments, i.e. those in which a given company receives venture capital for the first time. It is at these initial financing decisions that the competence sharing benefits of syndication are most evident (Lerner, 1994).  \n\nWe used the VentureXpert database to construct a dataset of first-round investments made by US-based VC firms over the period from 1980 to 2004. The start of the period in consideration (1980) was selected to reflect a qualitative change in the US VC industry, mainly motivated by the passing of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1979, which allowed pension funds and other institutional investors to invest in private equity and spurred significant growth in the venture capital industry. Our data included 35,757 such investments made by 2,498 VC firms. For each investment, we used the number of participating VC firms to create an indicator for whether the particular VC firm has formed a syndicate. Investments in which only the focal VC firm was involved were coded as nonsyndicated (i.e. solo), and investments in which more than one investor was involved were coded as syndicated (i.e. syndicated)3.  \n\n### 4.1. Independent Variables  \n\nTo determine the novelty of each investment for the focal VC firm, we calculated the total number of investments made previously by the focal VC firm in the industry of the investment. We used the 9 main industry categories used by VentureXpert - (1) communications and media, (2) computer related, (3) semiconductors, (4) biotechnology, (5) medical/pharmaceutical, (6) energy related, (7) consumer related, (8) industrial products, and (9) other manufacturing and services. To the extent that a VC firm has made more investments previously in a given industry - and thus can draw from its experience to make new decisions - a new investment it considers in that industry would be more familiar. We used the logged value of the number of prior investments to reflect the fact that each additional investment has a diminishing effect on the familiarity and learning it brings to the VC firms. In addition, we reverse coded the derived values for this variable so that a higher value represents higher novelty for the focal VC firm.  \n\nTo measure VC firm status, we constructed for each year a matrix of relationships between all VC firms included in the VentureXpert database. For a matrix constructed for year (t), each element (Ri) represented the number of times firms (i) and (j) had co-invested together over the 5-year period precedingyear $\\mathrm{(t)^{4}}$ . We considered two VC firms co-investing if they made investments in the same company in the same year. We measured a VC firm's network status in year (t) - reflecting the pattern of its relationships in the preceding five years - using Bonacich's (1987) centrality measure, which is commonly used in the literature (Podolny 2001; Sorenson and Stuart 2001). Based on this measure, the status of a VC firm is dependent on the number and status of its investment partners. The measure, ${\\sf c i}({\\sf a},\\upbeta)$ takes the form ${\\sf c}_{\\mathrm{i}}({\\sf a},\\beta)=\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{j}}({\\sf a}+\\beta{\\sf c}_{\\mathrm{j}}){\\sf R}_{\\mathrm{ij}}$ ,where ${\\sf R}_{\\mathrm{ij}}$ is an element of a relational matrix R, representing the relationship between firms (i) and (i) as discussed above. The parameter α is an arbitrary scaling coefficient of the measure, while $\\upbeta$ represents the degree to which the centrality of firm (i) is a function of the centralities of other firms in the industry network. We set $\\upbeta$ equal to three quarters of the largest eigenvalue (see Borgatti, Everett and Freeman, 2002; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001). We calculated a centrality score for each VC firm and each year and normalized the scores, giving the highest status firm in any given year a score of one and the lowest status a score of zero (Podolny, 2001). Such operationalization allows us to rank each VC firm's social standing relative to all other firms in the industry network and accounts for the dynamic change of status across years.  \n\nWe measured the VC firm's reputation relevant for its activity in year (t) as a composite of the firms' age (in years) in year (t-1), the total number of investments made by the end of year (t-1), and the total number of IPOs achieved by the end of year (t-1). The reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of this composite measure was above 0.80 for all years. Whereas the number of IPOs captured the most visible aspect of a VC firm's prior performance, the firm's age and extensity of prior investment activity also reflected the aspects of performance that were more subtle and harder to measure. Indeed, high longevity and extensive investment activity are indicators of successful, sustained fundraising by the VC firm, which in turn reflect positive performance appraisal by the institutional investor community (Podolny, 2001). The composite reputation scores were based on standardized values for each component. In addition, the standardization was made for each year, thereby ensuring that each reputation score was based only on information available by year (t). We normalized the scores for each year across VC firms so that the lowest reputation in each year had a value of zero and the highest a value of one'.  \n\n### 4.2. Control Variables  \n\nWe included an extensive set of control variables in order to eliminate some alternative explanations for our findings and account for other drivers of syndication. In regard to the focal VC firms, we controlled for several time-varying characteristics that may affect their desire and ability to syndicate the current investment. First, to capture the baseline propensity of VC firms to syndicate their investments, we controlled for the proportion of previously syndicated frst-round investments. Second, because a firm's prior experience with managing novel projects may reduce the need for prospective partners, we introduce a variable measuring the number of previous investments that were no later than a fifth investment by the VC firm in a particular industry, which was then divided by the total number of previous investments made by the VC firm. Third, to account for the fact that knowledge of the local geographical area may facilitate the VC firm's understanding of the investment at hand, we controlled for the VC firm's investment experience in the state of the particular company, measured as the number of previous investments made in the state of the focal investment divided by the total number of previous investments made by the VC firm. Fourth, we controlled for the alignment of the investment opportunities pursued by the VC firm with those pursued in the VC industry as a whole, to account for the possibility that attuned investment preferences may bestow legitimacy and facilitate syndication. We measured such alignment as Euclidean distance between the industry distributions of the VC firm's portfolio prior to the focal investment and the aggregate portfolio of all VC firms over the period in which the focal VC frm had been active\". Fifth, to distinguish between more “active\" and “passive\" modes of VC investing and account for focal VC firm's differing needs for financial risk sharing and syndication, we controlled for whether the VC firm had raised a new fund within the previous 2 years. Finall, we controlled for the structural holes (lagged) in the VC firm's network. Because structural holes afford access to valuable, non-redundant information (Burt, 1992), this accounted for the possibility that some VC firms may be more privy to such information and thus mitigate their egocentric uncertainty (Podolny,  \n\n2001) or be considered atractive partners (Shipilov and Li, 2008). We measured structural holes using Burt's constraint measure (1992) which reflects the degree to which a firm is connected to firms that share the same partners.  \n\nWe also controlled for several fixed characteristics of the VC firm and portfolio company. First, to account for the possibity that independent VC firms had more strategic freedom and discretion, while other types of VC firms could operate under additional strategic or liquidity constraints (Manigart et al., 2002; Mayer, Schoorsb and Yafeh, 2005), we controlled for whether the VC firm was private, a corporate subsidiary or an affliate of a financial institution. Second, we controlled for whether the company receiving the VC investment was in a high-technology industry (indicators for Information and Communication Technology and Biotech/Medical) and at an early stage of development because such deals are generally more likely to be syndicated. Third, to account for the distinct nature of the California region in the emergence of the particular technologies (Saxenian, 1994) and in syndication practices (Bygrave, 1987), we controlled for whether the VC firm or the company receiving the investment were located in California.  \n\nFinally, to account for the endogenous nature of the choice of investing in a new or less familiar industry, we included a self-selection correction factor (Heckman, 1979; Shaver, 1998), estimated from the probability that a given VC firm will invest in an industry in which it had made no more than five previous investments, a cutoff based on the median value of the investment novelty variable7.  \n\n### 4.3. Model  \n\nTo estimate the likelihood of a VC firm's syndicating a particular investment, we organized the data in a panel format and estimated a random-effects Logit model. The relatively low value of the panel variance component in all estimations (.15 - .18) suggested that a random effects model was indeed more appropriate for the data at hand than a fixed effects model. In order to account for the fact that more than one investment was made by a VC firm in a given year - and thus for possible nonindependence of observations within each year - we included year dummies as well as used a robust estimation of the standard errors adjusted for clustering on VC firm (Rogers, 1993).  \n\n## 5. Results  \n\n### 5.1. Main Analyses  \n\nIn Table 1, we present the descriptive statistics and correlations. We present the results of the random-effects Logit estimation in Table 2. Model 1 contains only the control variables; Model 2 adds the main effects of status and reputation; Model 3 adds the main effect of investment novelty; Models 4 and 5 add individually the interaction effects of investment novelty with status and reputation, while Model 6 contains all variables and interaction effects. All models are significant and each subsequent model improves the fit of its preceding model, as suggested by the incremental Chi-square statistics. In all models, consistent with the knowledge-sharing rationale for syndication, syndication is more likely for companies in the high-technology industries and at earlier stages of development. In addition, in Model 2, status exhibits a positive and significant effect on syndication, while the effect of reputation is positive but not significant. Both effects are positive and significant once investment novelty is added to the model (Model 3).  \n\nHypothesis 1 predicted that the likelihood of syndication would increase with the novelty of the investment to the VC firm. In Model 3, the addition of investment novelty significantly improved the fit of the model $(\\Delta\\chi^{2}=9.42,\\mathsf{p}<.01)$ . Its effect was positive and significant $(\\upbeta=0.10$ $p<0.001$ ),suggesting that the syndication of more novel investments was more likely. This finding provides support for Hypothesis 1.  \n\nHypothesis 2 predicted that the positive effect of investment novelty on syndication would be stronger for VC firms with higher status. The interaction effect of investment novelty and status was positive and significant in both Models 4 and 6 $(\\upbeta=0.46$ $p<0.01$ and $\\upbeta=0.48,p<0.01)$ .To understand and illustrate the nature of the interaction, we plotted the effect of investment novelty on the likelihood of syndication for VC firms with high and low status, using the results from Model 6, as presented in Figure 1. As the plot shows, the likelihood of syndication increases with investment novelty and this increase is much stronger for high-status firms. This suggests that the altercentric uncertainty inherent to novel investments is more effectively mitigated by firms with higher status. This result provides support for Hypothesis 2.  \n\nHypothesis 3 predicted that the positive effect of investment novelty on syndication would be stronger for VC firms with higher reputation. The interaction effect of investment novelty and reputation was negative and significant in both Models 5 and 6 $(\\upbeta=-0.23\\$ $p<0.01$ and $\\upbeta=-0.25$ $p<0.001$ ). In Figure 2 we present an illustration of this interaction, using the results from Model 6, and plot the effect of investment novelty on the likelihood of syndication for VC firms with high and low reputation. The plot shows that when investment novelty is low, VC firms with high reputation are more likely to syndicate their investments. However, as investment novelty increases, this effect gradually disappears and for the most novel investments, higher reputation of the VC firm is in fact associated with lower likelihood of syndication. This finding is opposite to the prediction of Hypothesis 3, and suggests that reputation does not effectively shield the VC firm from the altercentric uncertainty inherent in novel investments.  \n\n### 5.2. Robustness Analyses  \n\nIn Table 3 we present several additional analyses performed to corroborate the robustness of our results. First, because some of the syndicated investments had unidentified investors, we could not properly adjust the number of investors for the cases in which the same VC firm invested through different funds in the same round. To rule out that such omissions in the data were non-random and potentially distorting our results, we re-estimated the full model from Table 2 using only the cases in which all participating investors were properly identified in the data. This estimation is reported as Model 1 in Table 3. Its results are consistent with our main estimation. Notably the positive interaction effect between project novelty and status is of higher magnitude, while the negative interaction effect between project novelty and reputation is of lower magnitude and marginally significant.  \n\nSecond, because we could not reliably infer whether the focal VC firm was indeed the one initiating the syndication relationship - i.e. whether it was the one seeking and being evaluated by prospective partners - it was plausible that some of the first-round investors in our dataset were nonlead. Therefore, in consideration of the fact that lead and non-lead investors syndicate for different reasons (Manigart et al. 2006) and use different criteria in evaluating partners (Lockett & Wright, 1999), we re-estimated our results on the subset of lead investors. We followed recent practice (Sorensen and Stuart, 2008) and, for each portfolio company, designated as lead investors those VC firms that have participated in the most rounds. Model 2 in Table 3 presents the results of this analysis, which are fully consistent with those presented in Table 2.  \n\nThird, to address the additional challenge of having multiple observations of particular investments (one for each VC firm participating in the syndicate), we randomly chose one VC firm from the cases in which there was more than one participating VC firm and re-estimated the main results using this reduced dataset. Model 3 in Table 3 shows the results of this analysis. Again, these are fully consistent with those reported in Table 2.  \n\n# Insert Table 3 about here  \n\n### 5.3. Post-hoc Analyses  \n\nOne additional consideration concerned a possible alternative explanation based on the idea that alliances between parties that have a history of partnering together were more likely to be formed (Gulati, 1995a; Podolny, 1994). In the VC industry, prior interactions are also an important factor in partner selection (Locket & Wright, 1999). Indeed, it is plausible that when faced with high need and reduced opportunity to form investment syndicates, VC firms could turn to familiar partners, thereby partially mitigating their altercentric uncertainty. While we could not observe the set of potential partners prior to the event of syndicate formation and only had data on the actual partners (if any), the \"familiarity breeds trust” argument (Gulati, 1995a) in the context of this study would imply that among the formed syndication alliances those involving novel investments were more likely to involve familiar partners. To investigate this possibility, we derived all VC firm dyads from among the syndicated investments and obtained the number of times that the two VC firms in question had invested together prior to the current investment. We also determined whether the investment was novel to one or both VC firms, based on above-median investment novelty values. In addition, we also characterized the entire syndicate in terms of the number of VC firms for whom the investment was novel and the number of prior relationships among the members of the syndicate. In Table 4, we present descriptive statistics for partner familiarity - expressed both as the average number of prior co-investments and the proportion of unfamiliar partners - for the investor dyads and the entire syndicates, broken down based on the number of VC firms in the dyad or syndicate for whom the investment was novel. For both the dyad and the syndicate, novel investments tend to involve less familiar partners. This relationship is significant, as implied by the F-values from one-way ANOVA analyses for each column. In addition, these effects persist even if the status and reputation of the VC firms are taken into consideration. These results suggest that partner familiarity does not drive the syndication of novel investments. Rather, the partners attracted for novel investments are more likely to be unfamiliar.  \n\nInsert Table 4 about here  \n\nFinally, our theoretical predictions and findings are premised on the notion that status serves as a mitigator of altercentric uncertainty and differentiates firms in their ability to attract partners. The value of status is preserved by careful management of the firm's associations with other firms. In this regard, prior research suggests that high-status VC firms tend to syndicate their investments with other highstatus firms (Piskorski and Anand, 2004). To the extent that such status homophily is evident in our data, and particularly in the syndication of novel investments, we could infer that novel investments indeed pose a legitimacy hurdle to the focal VC firms and that status plays a differentiating role in the firm's ability to attract partners for such investments. In view of this, we examined further the composition of the formed syndicates in our data and, in Table 5, present a tabulation of the status match-ups between the focal VC firm and its syndicate partners. Specifically, we divide the VC firms into status quartiles and, based on the quartile of the focal VC firm, present the proportion of partners whose status falls into the same quartile. In Panel A, we include all syndicates and in Panel B we focus on the syndicates in which the investments is novel to the focal VC firm (ie. the firm has made no investments previously in the particular industry). In both cases, we observe a tendency for the focal VC firm to associate with partners of similar status, and this tendency is the strongest for high-status firms. This suggests that status in our setting operates in a way consistent with prior theory and studies.  \n\n# Insert Table 5 about here  \n\n## 6. Discussion  \n\nFor firms to form alliances, it is necessary for them to have both the need and opportunity to do so. But these two aspects of alliance formation are not always aligned: in certain situations, the factors that increase the firm's need to form alliances may also reduce the opportunity for the firm to find and attract alliance partners. In this study, we sought to understand this interplay between need and opportunity in the context of projects that are novel to the firm undertaking them, which allowed us to differentiate two types of uncertainty - egocentric and altercentric - inherent in such projects. Specifically, we examined the syndication of investments by VC firms. On one hand, when considering investments that are novel to them, VC firms face egocentric uncertainty, related to the proper decisions to be made in selecting and managing such investments, and thus have higher need for syndication. On the other hand, these very same investments enshrine the focal VC firms in altercentric uncertainty, rendering them difficult to appraise by potential partners. This in turn makes the focal firms' opportunity to syndicate novel investments contingent upon their ability to signal their quality to potential partners. Consistent with these arguments, we found that projects novel to the VC firm are more likely to be syndicated. In addition, we found that this relationship was much stronger for VC firms with high status and, contrary to our expectations, weaker for VC frms with high reputation.  \n\n### 6.1. Research Contributions and Managerial Implications  \n\nOur study suggests that need and opportunity, rather than being independent aspects of alliance formation, are in fact intertwined at the level of the projects for which firms may seek to form alliances. We provide an enriched understanding of the uncertainty residing in the relationship between a firm and the specific projects it undertakes. In particular, when projects are novel to the firm, the firm's lack of knowledge of the project domain makes its need for alliances more salient. This is consistent with a resource dependence perspective according to which firms attempt to co-opt the resources in the environment when presented with uncertain situations (Pfeffer and Salancik 1978). Yet, the novel aspect of our study lies in highlighting that these same projects, to the extent that they are detached from the firm's prior actions and existing knowledge, also make the firm more fuzzy as a party in the social exchange. In other words, undertaking novel projects can serve as a red flag for the firm's quality as a partner for these projects due to its uncertain ability to make project-specific contributions, which ultimately undermines its ability to attract partners for such projects. Potential partners, unable to assess the potential contribution of the focal firm, have to rely on their overall perceptions of the firm in deciding whether to join forces with it on such projects.  \n\nWe contribute to the literature on venture capital investing and syndication by highlighting an unexplored, relational aspect of uncertainty, inherent in a particular VC firm - investment dyad and reflecting the VC firm's understanding of the particular company and its environment. While prior research has focused on the uncertainty reflected in the characteristics of a specific investment target (e.g. early stage or high technology) as a driver for syndication (e.g. Bygrave, 1987), we have argued that such uncertainty need not be perceived uniformly among potential investors. Certain investments - no matter how uncertain themselves - may be more or less uncertain to different VC firms, based on the extent of their prior experience in the specific industry of the investment. By differentiating the VC firm's experience and accounting for the relative lack of familiarity of the focal VC firm with the industry of the investment at hand (i.e. the novelty of the investment to the VC firm), we were able to explain variation in syndication beyond the one accounted by the independent, objective characteristics of the VC firm and the investment. In addition to the egocentric uncertainty faced by the focal VC firm in considering the (novel) investment at hand, we also highlighted the uncertainty (altercentric) that other VC firms face in considering the focal VC firm as a potential partner for that investment. Our results show that when the focal VC firm's experience cannot be used to make reliable inferences about its potential contribution to the investment at hand, firms that can project stronger signals of their quality - such as those with high status - are more likely to aract syndicate partners.  \n\nThe importance of dealing with altercentric uncertainty when seeking partners for novel projects helps reveal differences between status and reputation as signals of quality at the project level. We provide evidence that reputation may be a less effective signal for attracting partners when alliances involve novel projects. While some of our results still speak to the value of reputation in alliance formation and corroborate prior findings - the direct effect of reputation on alliance formation was positive (cf. Dollinger et al., 1997; Saxton, 1997) - finding a negative interaction effect with project novelty challenges our thinking and provides opportunities for future research to refine current theorizing on the reputation construct. Although initially surprising, this finding invites a deeper examination of the content of the informational signal that reputation carries. We built our hypothesis on the premise that reputation is a performance-based signal, and as such should appease partners concerns about actor uncertainty through the positive expectations of future outcomes. Several interesting insights emerge when this conceptualization is revisited in the context of our findings.  \n\nFirst, defined as a performance-based signal, it is possible that the content of the reputation signal is too closely coupled with the firm's specific prior actions, and represents a much narrower expectation of future behavior, as compared to status (Podolny, 2005). Based on the notion of competency traps from the learning literature (Levitt and March, 1988), it is plausible that potential partners may fear that the reputable firm may insist on applying its previously successful practices to the novel project, when these need not be applicable and beneficial to the project's development. To that extent, our results suggest that beyond its direct positive association with alliance formation, reputation appears to help firms in finding partners to the extent that they stick to activities for which they are known (see left side of Figure 2). Hence, our results imply that the value of reputation may be bounded by the nature of the project in which the respective firm is involved. In a similar vein, to the extent that potential partners consider their own gain from the alliance, and particularly the possibility to learn from the focal firm (e.g. Lane and Lubatkin, 1998), it is plausible that the reputation of the focal firm and the knowledge it signifies may have limited appeal in the context of novel projects, as there might be limited opportunity to learn from the local firm in the context of such projects.  \n\nSecond, while our results suggest that the positive reputation signal does not carry readily to novel domains, there may be specific aspects of reputation untapped in this research that help firms acquire partners when venturing into novel areas. In this regard, a firm's reputation can be conceptualized as a multifaceted construct (Rindova et al., 2005) depending on the diversity of relevant actions on which it is built (Dollinger et al., 1997). For example, a firm can have technological reputation (Zahra, Matherne and Carleton, 2003); reputation for consistency and good product quality (Rhee and Haunschild, 2006); reputation for business integrity (Jensen and Roy, 2008); or a reputation for successful cooperation (Baum, Calabrese and Silverman, 2000; Gulati, 1995b). This suggests that a more refined measure of firm's reputation may be necessary to tease out its role in mitigating altercentric uncertainty, based on the specific concerns of potential partners. In this regard, to the extent that a firm can be perceived by the same audience to have positive reputation for one activity but less positive reputation for another (Jensen and Roy, 2008), future research can focus on the content and relevant components of reputation as a signal of quality and assess their individual and joint effects in attracting potential partners.  \n\nIn contrast, our results suggest that status is a more robust quality signal in the context of novel projects. Beyond its overall positive effect, which is consistent with the importance of social context in influencing firms' alliance formation (Gulati, 1995b) and partner selection (Jensen and Roy, 2008), we found that its effect was stronger for novel projects. Although this result is consistent with the general notion that status matters more for partnering when firms face market uncertainty, it also adds important nuance in the conception of uncertainty inherent in this relationship, based on a differentiation of a firm's experience across different projects. More specifically, whereas prior research has found status to be important in reducing uncertainty when the later is equated with the characteristics of a project (e.g. underwriting a non-investment-grade bond; Podolny, 1994) or of the firm (e.g. its experience in a given market; Jensen, 2003), our account of uncertainty as residing in the firm-project combination suggests that status also matters in hitherto overlooked circumstances. While prior literature would lead us to suggest that investments that are generally perceived as less uncertain would reduce the value of status (Podolny, 1994), we point out that such investments may appear more uncertain when undertaken by firms with limited knowledge of their specifics. In these circumstances, status reemerges as an important signal of quality. Equally, firms that are overall more experienced can consider investments in less familiar areas and face the limits to extrapolation. Hence, by conceptualizing uncertainty as relative to the investor-project dyad, we are able to depict circumstances in which current theory may underestimate the value of status.  \n\nWhen compared to reputation, status is a signal of quality that is dissociated from behavior and more related to existing relations and affliations (Podolny, 2005). As such, it appears to provide a more robust signal of quality, enhance the returns to demonstrations of quality by biasing evaluations in favor of higher-status actors (Benjamin and Podolny, 1999), and provide more resilience to firms in situations in which uncertainties about their reputation may arise (Podolny 2005). Hence, while prior research suggests that both status and reputation make the firm a more desirable partner, as has been observed in the VC industry (Lerner, 1994; Hochberg, Ljungquist and Lu, 2007; Podolny, 2001), observing alliances at project levels has allowed us to highlight a range of firm behaviors over which these two constructs diverge. Venturing into unfamiliar domains helps differentiate social and economic signals in the opportunities they afford to find and atract partners.  \n\nOur results also carry a number of practical implications. In considering investments into unfamiliar or less familiar industries, VC managers need to be aware that, to the extent that they look for potential syndicate partners, such partners are less likely to be swayed by the firm's prior track record and more by its prior associations. In this regard, VC firms already enjoying high status can consider that, beyond facilitating IPOs, their network status may be leveraged to enter new domains and occupy competitive positions within new industries. In contrast, VC firms positioned on the margins of the network can focus on deepening their expertise within existing domains and look to leverage that expertise into relationships that can boost their status. Similarly, VC firms with successful track records should use their ability to attract partners in their “traditional\" domains to select higher-status partners that can boost their social standing. More broadly, beyond the context of VC investing, our results suggest to managers that tradition and past successes can be discounted when looking to attract partners for novel projects and that, to the extent there is continuous pressure to look for new opportunities, careful attention needs to be paid to the cultivation of relationships that can make such opportunities more accessible.  \n\n### 6.2. Limitations and Future Research  \n\nThere are some limitations to our study that also open up directions for future research. Although syndication is widespread in the VC industry (Lerner, 1994; Hochberg et al., 2007) and offers buffers against various uncertainties (Bygrave, 1987), implicit in our theoretical development and analysis is the premise that syndication is always a desirable strategy to cope with uncertainty. In other words, non-syndicated investments were regarded as cases in which the focal VC firm had sought investment partners but failed to find any. We acknowledge that in certain situations VC firms may explicitly prefer to keep the deal for themselves (e.g. Snellman and Piskorski, 2003) and suggest that future research model this decision more explicitly. In addition, to the extent that the current investment is part of a more extensive syndication agreement that covers a series of investments, there may be unobserved interactions among the syndicate partners that offer additional considerations for syndication. Another issue to which we have not given explicit consideration concerns the degree to which VC firms are indeed aware of each other's status and reputation. While this is a commonly held assumption in economic sociology, future work can incorporate explicit perceptions of these signals.  \n\nFurthermore, seeking to understand the formation of syndicate relationships, we left beyond the scope of our work whether syndication indeed provided eventual benefits for the focal investment. While some may see this as a limitation of our study, we note that prior research has established that the effects of syndication can be positive (e.g. Brander et al., 2002; DeClercq and Dimov, 2008) as well as negative, when the cost of managing the syndicate become too burdensome (Dimov and De Clercq, 2006). In this regard, investigating how the management and benefits of syndicates operate in the context of novel investments and are affected by the status and reputation of the participating syndicate partners is a promising area of research. On this point, it is notable that the interference of status and reputation can create a spurious relationship between syndication and performance: they not only play instrumental roles in attracting investment partners and but also afford a higher potential for performance, based on easier access to resources or demonstrated superior performance in the past. In addition, the prior experience and social networks of VC firm's individual partners can be considered to differentiate the firms' responses to potential investments that are novel at the firm level but may leverage the knowledge or social capital of individual partners. These considerations open up new possibilities for more precise theorizing and empirical rigor in examining the relationship between syndication and performance.  \n\nFinally, although the US VC context represents a homogenous sample of syndicates, thus avoiding the empirical issue of variations among alliance types (c.f. Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1996), we acknowledge that care should be taken in generalizing our results to other contexts. VC syndicates resemble other forms of alliances (Gulati, 1995b) in that they represent long-term commitments to cooperative relationships in which the participating firms exchange knowledge and resources (Wright and Lockett, 2003), yet they are also distinct in that some of the partners (typically, the lead investors) may be doing more work than in a typical collaborative alliance. Such arrangements exist in more traditionally studied alliance contexts, such as in the biotechnology industry, where one partner (a biotechnology venture) may be providing most of the knowledge and innovation, while the other (a big pharmaceutical company) provides operational and financial resources and possibly managerial expertise (e.g. Powell, Koput, and Smith-Doerr, and Owen-Smith, 1999), but they involve partners from different areas of the value chain. In addition, compared to the relatively short-lived syndicates in investment banking that have offered insights into the dynamics of alliance networks (Chung et al, 2000; Jensen, 2003), VC syndicates last longer and involve stronger partner commitments that are more difficult to terminate. As such, their formation highlights the importance of the decision of whether and with whom to syndicate a particular project and thus facilitate generalization to other forms of strategic alliances.  \n\n### 6.3. Conclusion  \n\nIn conclusion, this study reinforces the notion that firms seek and establish alliances when they undertake novel, uncertain projects. However, it also shows that these very projects can also reduce the firm's desirability as partner and make it differentialy positioned to carry out such projects. Comparing firm reputation and status as quality signals enabled us not only to highlight their different effects in enticing partners for novel projects but also to reveal their different functions in the partner selection process. Since attaining status and reputation requires time and valuable resources, understanding the scope and boundary conditions of their leverage for satisfying alliance needs and building aliance opportunities for firms is an important area for future research with promising implications for managerial practice.  \n\n## 7.

We find that while finance expertise is associated with a lower proportion of early-stage investments, this relationship is weaker for firms with high reputation and stronger for firms with high status. We conclude with a discussion of the importance and nuances of external image considerations on investment decisions as well as insights into the importance of the requisite nature of expertise.  \n\nKeywords: venture capital, investment selection, TMT expertise, reputation, status  \n\n## 1. Executive summary  \n\nThere has been significant scholarly interest in understanding the investment selection decisions of venture capital (VC) firms, e.g., the selection criteria or cognitive processes involved in making these decisions. Researchers have made a substantial contribution to the literature by identifying common elements to the decision making processes across VC firms. With this paper, we seek to understand why these processes lead to different selection results, i.e., why equally aspiring VC firms make early-stage investments to varying degrees. Acknowledging the importance of top management team (TMT) composition for decision making and the inclusion of VC firms in investment and fundraising networks, we concomitantly consider the effects of finance expertise of the VC firm's management team and the firm's reputation and status on investment selection.  \n\nWe find that VC firms with higher finance expertise select fewer early-stage investments. In addition, despite the apparent similarity of the constructs of reputation and status as representations of how a firm is perceived by its external constituents, this study allows us to disentangle their distinct facets. We find that both reputation and status moderate the finance expertise-investment decision relationship but in opposing ways. Status magnifies this relationship: for higher-status VC firms, higher finance expertise induces an even stronger avoidance of early-stage investments. Interestingly, reputation appears to have the opposite, alleviating effect: the negative relationship between finance expertise and early stage investments is stronger for less reputable firms than for more reputable firms. We account for this surprising finding in our discussion by developing a number of possible explanations around management discretion, affordability of experimentation, and the role of reputation in increasing the odds of success.  \n\nOur study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by explaining why some VC firms make more early-stage investments than others and by enhancing the theoretical arsenal for studying VC decision making. We also contribute to the broader organizational literature in two important ways. First, our results suggest that researchers need to pay closer attention to the type rather than simply the amount of management team expertise. Second, although external image considerations play important roles in management decision making, we tease out important but heretofore ignored nuances in the concepts of reputation and status.  \n\nThere are a number of practical implications that emerge from our study. From the VC firm perspective, the results provide insight into how their management team expertise and social standing affect their deal flow and ultimate investment selection. From the perspective of the recipient of venture capital, our results suggest that entrepreneurs looking for early-stage financing for their ventures would be well served by an in-depth examination of the management expertise of their potential VC firms. Given the strong network repercussions of a “no decision\", it pays to be exposed to the “right\" VC firm early on.  \n\n## 2. Introduction  \n\nThere has been substantial scholarly interest in understanding the investment selection decisions of venture capital (VC) firms. In particular, researchers have sought to explore the decision-making process in terms of the selection criteria applied (MacMillan, Siegel, and Subbanarasimha 1985; Muzyka, Birley, and Leleux 1996; Shepherd, Ettenson, and Crouch 2000; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; Wright, Robbie, and Ennew 1997) or the cognitive processes employed (Hisrich and Jankowicz 1990; Rosman and O'Neill 1993; Zacharakis and Shepherd 2001). What is common to all these studies is that researchers have focused on the commonalities across VC firms, thereby identifying a proto-typical decision making process. As a result, the differences in investment decisions, reflecting individual or organizational differences in evaluating the opportunities or risks associated with prospective ventures, have received relatively little attention.  \n\nIt is now well established in organizational research that a firm's strategic choices are driven by its top management team (TMT), and that differences in such choices can be explained by TMT demographics (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Recent application of this view to the context of VC firm performance has shown that the nature of the VC partnersi expertise indeed affects both the successes and failures in the firm's portfolio (Dimov and Shepherd, 2005). Yet, in addition to such firm-specific effects, there are also external influences. Specifically, in order to mitigate the uncertainty they face in selecting potential investments, VC firms are continuously involved in investment syndicates (Bygrave, 1987; Lerner, 1994) and are thus part of a broader social network. Their standing in this network appears to influence their investment decisions (Podolny, 2001; Sorensen and Stuart, 2001).  \n\nThe purpose of this paper is to examine the degree to which VC firms′ investment decisions are affected by the (requisite) nature of their TMT expertise and their social network standing. To capture the latter, we use two constructs - reputation and status - used in the fields of strategy and economic sociology to represent an organization’s social standing. Despite the apparent similarity of these two constructs, as evidenced by the significant overlap in their use (e.g. Gulati and Higgins, 2003; Podolny, 2001; Shane and Cable, 2002; Stuart, 1998; Stuart, Hoang, and Hybels, 1999), this study follows recent work that disentangles their distinct facets (Washington and Zajac, 2005). Specifically, we study the investment allocation decisions of 108 US venture capital firms over a 6-year period. We highlight the importance of relevant (i.e. requisite) expertise and also show that reputation and status moderate the expertise-decision relationship in opposing ways.  \n\nOur study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by enhancing its theoretical arsenal for the study of VC decision making and by explaining why, among equally aspiring VC firms, some make more early-stage investments than others. In line with recent arguments presented by Vogus and Sutcliffe (2003), our results suggest that researchers need to pay closer attention to the type rather than simply the amount of management team expertise. Our findings contribute to the upper echelon perspective by highlighting the role of external image considerations in TMT decision making. And we also contribute to the strategy and economic sociology literatures by teasing out important, heretofore ignored nuances in the constructs of reputation and status, representing a firm's external image.  \n\nThe article proceeds as follows. First, we provide an overview of the concept of requisite expertise and discuss its specific form in the context of venture capital firms and their portfolio investments. We then discuss the concepts of reputation and status and provide specific arguments for their moderating effects on the relationship between TMT requisite expertise and investment selection. In the remaining sections, we describe our methodology and results, and then discuss our findings.  \n\n## 3. Theory and hypotheses  \n\nVenture capital firms raise funds from various investors and then seek to invest these funds in private companies with the purpose of achieving superior investment returns. While some VC firms invest in companies that are in the process of exploring ideas for which there are not yet developed commercial products or tested markets (i.e. early-stage companies), others prefer late-stage companies, i.e. those with well-defined market and product characteristics, seeking to expand or improve their established business. The less developed a prospective company, the higher the uncertainty that a VC firm faces in making its investment decision (Podolny, 2001).  \n\n### 3.1. Management team expertise and investment choice  \n\nThe contemplation of any investment essentially entails weighing the opportunities and threats that it poses to a particular investor. A considerable body of research in organizations suggests that although top managers within firms perceive environmental threats and opportunities similarly, they perceive them differently from top managers in other organizations, even within the same industry (Milliken, 1990; Sutcliffe and Huber, 1998). And while a number of factors may account for these inter-organizational differences (Boyd, Dess, and Rasheed, 1993; Sutcliffe, 1994), the diversity of team members′ past work experiences often affects the team's perspectives and opinions (e.g., Sutcliffe, 1994), actions (McDonald and Westphal, 2003), as well as organizational outcomes (Bunderson and Sutcliffe, 2002). With differences in the composition of organizations′ top management teams (TMTs), there are different strategic actions towards uncertain markets (Flood, Fong, Smith, O'Regan, Moore, and Morley, 1997)  \n\nThe relationship between TMT's functional diversity and performance, although widely studied, has shown mixed results (see Bunderson and Sutcliffe [2002] for a review). Functional background is a proxy for the information, knowledge, skills, and expertise that individuals bring to a group (Williams and O'Reilly, 1998). Researchers have generally focused on the breadth or amount of variety within a team, i.e., whether the different dominant functional perspectives across team members cover a broad range of functional categories or are restricted to a subset of categories, thereby overlooking the “relevance”’ of the variety. Although studies have assumed that any variety will do, a growing body of work suggests that variety alone is insufficient to benefit an organization. Rather, as Vogus and Sutcliffe (2003) argue (and empirically show), it is the content of variety that matters (Cohen, 1986) and the extent to which a team's variety matches the characteristics of the firm's environment(s). In other words, performance depends on the appropriateness of the team's specific knowledge for the organization's environment(s) or strategy. Relevant expertise affects the team's understanding of the uncertainty that exists and is likely to influence the team's decisions to enter particular market segments (Van de Ven, 1986).  \n\nAlthough the tasks of the VC firm can be classified in terms of pre- and postinvestment activities', in this study we are concerned with the former rather than the latter. Pre-investment activities involve those tasks up to, and including, the signing of an investment contract, e.g., soliciting new venture proposals for submission to the VC firm, determining whether these proposals meet the firm’s broad screening criteria, conducting due diligence (more extensive research to determine the likely success of the venture), and then negotiating and structuring a relationship with the entrepreneur. While some of the investment proposals pertain to companies that are in the process of exploring ideas for which there are not yet fully developed commercial products or tested markets (i.e. early stage), others involve companies with well established products and markets, seeking to expand or optimize their business (i.e. late stage). Decisions to invest in early- versus late-stage ventures are likely to hinge on the extent to which decision makers perceive the venture to be risky, as well as the extent to which they expect that there will be a proper risk-return balance. Assessments of these factors will be shaped by the distinct expertise held by a firm's TMT. On one hand, while early-stage ventures have higher perceived risk, relevant industry (operations, marketing, general management) or prior entrepreneurial experience reduce this risk (March and Shapira, 1987). This is driven at least in part by the expectation of adding value to the particular venture. On the other hand, an investment decision needs to be an efficient allocation of capital and thus requires a proper risk-return balance. The estimation of the latter is facilitated by finance experience and is more robust in the context of more established ventures. Therefore, a VC firm's experience may help explain the investment allocation diversity among VC firms.  \n\nWe focus explicitly on the TMT's expertise in finance, what we call finance capacity, and explore its implications for the investment allocation decisions by VC capital firms.  \n\nAccordingly, we implicitly treat other industry experience as a boundary condition for our theoretical development.? As indicated above, finance capacity is important as it ensures that financial resources are put to their most efficient use based on the criteria established by capital markets. Research has shown that when capital market considerations permeate an organization's performance environment, the number of executives with finance backgrounds increases (Fligstein, 1987; Thornton and Ocasio, 1999). In this regard, one of the main responsibilities of VC firms towards their fund investors is ensuring adequate returns given the risk profile of their portfolio and the opportunity cost for the fund investors (i.e. alternative investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds or real estate trusts).  \n\nThe finance capacity of a VC firm specifically refers to its top management team's expertise in evaluating the return potential as well as in managing the financial resources of a prospective venture. The value of a team's finance capacity comes from TMT members' abilities to assess the future pay-offs of potential investments and the risks associated with those pay-offs. Teams with greater finance capacity will also be more likely to recognize those contexts in which assessments of pay-off and risk are not possible (or are too costly) Because it provides the team with greater understanding of the investment potential, finance capacity improves the managers? comprehension of the requirements for making the potential investment successful. Furthermore, portfolio companies often look to the VC firm to provide finance and accounting information (Mitchell, Reid, and Terry, 1995).  \n\nLater-stage ventures have well-defined product-market characteristics, which allows for a better estimation of the potential portfolio company's future pay-offs and the level of unsystematic risk. As a consequence, later-stage investments represent a context in which risk (including agency risk) can be better managed (Amit, Brander, and Zott, 1998; Carter and van Auken, 1994; Eisenhardt, 1989). Finance capacity is a source of knowledge on how to best manage the risk of a particular investment, such as determining the most appropriate financial structure (e.g., a mix of voting and preference shares), as well as on how to improve portfolio firm performance, such as through introducing more “sophisticated” financial and information systems. Accordingly, if faced with two potential ventures with similar characteristics but at different stages of development, a VC firm with high finance capacity would prefer the later- to the earlier-stage venture.  \n\nHypothesis 1. There is a negative relationship between a VC firm's finance capacity and its decision to invest in early-stage ventures.  \n\n3.2 Organization's perceived quality, TMT expertise, and investment choice  \n\nEntangled in a network of syndication partners and institutional investors who have limited information to appropriately judge the quality of a VC firm, VC firms strive to project and maintain signals of their quality (Gompers, 1996). The concept of perceived quality has been well developed in strategy and economic sociology. In strategy research, firm quality is captured by the construct of reputation - a “perceptual representation of a company's past actions and future prospects that describe the firm's overall appeal to all its key constituents when compared to other leading rivals\" (Fombrun, 1996: 72). In economic sociology, firm quality is captured by the construct of status. It pertains to the external perception of the organization, based on the structural position that it occupies in its wider network of interorganizational relationships (Podolny, 1993) and is essentially an “unearned ascription of social rank\" (Washington and Zajac, 2005 p. 282).  \n\nA firm's reputation is established on the basis of its past performance, whereas its status is the consequence of its pattern of social relationships and the quality of its network partners. Despite the high degree of closeness between these two constructs, as evidenced by the significant overlap in their usage (e.g. Gulati and Higgins, 2003; Podolny, 2001; Shane and Cable, 2002; Stuart, 1998; Stuart et al., 1999), there might be distinct, heretofore unexplored facets to them. Indeed, as Washington and Zajac argue, “status is fundamentally a sociological concept that captures differences in social rank that generate privilege or discrimination (not performance-based rewards), while reputation is fundamentally an economic concept that captures differences in perceived or actual quality or merit that generate earned, performance-based rewards\" (2005 p. 283). Hence, in this section, we will focus on the particular effects that these two different “channels\"’ to perceived quality may exert on the relationship between TMT finance expertise and investment allocation decisions.  \n\n### 3.2.1 Reputation and perceived quality  \n\nReputation serves as a signal of future performance based on perceptions of past performance (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Podolny, 1994; Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Shane and Cable, 2002). For example, in their discussion of technological and commercial prominence, Stuart et al. (1999) found that those firms that had successfully exploited technological innovations or had been successful in evaluating biotechnology companies had built up reputations that underlay expectations by external parties that these firms would continue to be successful in the future. In the context of the VC industry, reputation is associated with the success of a VC firm's previous investments, which in turn affects the VC firm's ability to raise and invest new funds. For instance, the amount of money available to be invested in future portfolio companies is dependent, in part, upon VC firms’ past performances in terms of returns on investment and association with initial public offerings (IPOs) (Gompers, 1996). In addition, VC firms that have made successful investments in the past are more desirable syndication partners (Lerner, 1994) and thus have access to more  \n\ndeals. Visibility is also an important aspect of reputation (Lang and Lang, 1988) as it contributes to increasing the inflow of investments into funds (Sirri and Tufano, 1998).  \n\nIn the finance literature, there is a long tradition of examining the effects of reputation on investment behavior in financial markets. Reputation is often positively linked to the past performance of an actor. That is, external agents learn about the quality of the focal actor through observing its past performance over time (Milgrom and Roberts, 1982). In the context of fund management, there is a positive relationship between the inflow of new investment into a fund and the fund's past performance (Ippolito, 1992; Sirri and Tufano, 1998). Because fund management companies typically receive a fixed percentage of assets under management as compensation, there is a strong incentive for them to increase the total assets of the portfolio (Chevalier and Ellison, 1997). But increasing the total assets of the portfolio creates an additional incentive to alter its overall risk profile (Chevalier and Ellison, 1997). Specifically, those firms with superior past performance are more likely to develop a reputation for quality and this reputation represents a valuable asset, one worth protecting (Diamond, 1989). Reputation is protected by reducing the overall riskiness of the portfolio by making future investments in “safer” projects (Diamond, 1989).  \n\nThe above argument suggests that VC firms with high reputation may prefer “safer,\" i.e. later-stage projects. In other words, protecting a VC firm's reputation may move a firm away from early-stage projects. However, some VC firms may have made their reputation with investments in early-stage companies and thus be less willing to adjust their investment strategy away from such companies. As we argued earlier, the investment allocation into early- vs. late-stage projects depends on the VC firm managers′ possessing expertise that is requisite for the particular type of project. Where such expertise is lacking, there is lower perceived control over the project's outcomes and thus greater perceived risk for the project overall (March and Shapira, 1987). This is especially relevant to the VC context given the direct involvement of VCs in the management of their portfolio companies (Lerner, 1994, 1995; Sandberg, 1986; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984) and thus in their ultimate success or failure (Dimov and Shepherd, 2005). This suggests that expertise-allocation combinations that give rise to high perceived risk (i.e. when there is requisite mismatch) are likely to be perceived as less attractive investments, especially by those with high reputation who perceive that they have more to lose. Hypothesis 1 suggests that the requisite environment for a team of high finance capacity is that of later-stage investments. Therefore, for TMTs with high finance capacity, investing in early-stage companies is likely to be perceived as a riskier choice. This increased risk would constitute a particularly high concern for the more reputable VC firms as they strive to preserve their established reputations. Thus:  \n\nHypothesis 2. VC firm reputation strengthens the negative relationship between finance capacity and the decision to invest in early-stage ventures.  \n\n### 3.2.2 Status and perceived quality  \n\nThe sociological view of markets focuses on the social construction of the positions that the various organizations occupy (White, 1981). When there is uncertainty over the quality of organizations involved in a particular market as well as prohibitive costs of carrying out evaluative search, an organization's status provides a signal of quality (Podolny, 1993). The status-based nature of market competition creates an uneven distribution of rewards and cost burdens within markets, such that high status organizations have lower transaction costs in acquiring resources (Podolny, 1993) and are the preferred partners of other high-status organizations (Podolny, 1994), both of which are positively associated with performance (Stuart et al., 1999).  \n\nAs Podolny (2001) argues, however, high status is not universally valuable; it is of little value when there is high uncertainty about the decisions an organization should make to achieve market success. Put differently, without knowing what market opportunities to pursue, it is difficult for a firm to leverage its high status due to the possibility that it might line up resources towards the “wrong” opportunity. To the extent that the “wrong” allocation of resources creates a negative association for the firm, it will have an undermining effect on it status (Washington and Zajac, 2005). High-status firms thus tend to avoid projects of high uncertainty. The corollary of this logic for the context of venture capital investment decisions is that as the status of a VC firm increases, the firm tends to move away from investments in early-stage companies, i.e., those projects for which there is greater uncertainty about what it takes to achieve market success (Podolny, 2001).  \n\nYet, as we have argued so far, project uncertainty is not absolute but rather firm specific, dependent upon the requisite nature of the VC firm's management expertise. For a VC team with particular finance capacity, some projects will elicit higher uncertainty than others and thus put more strain on the VC firm's status. A VC firm would utilize better the transaction cost benefits derived from its status for its less uncertain projects - it could access high quality exchange partners to sell-off some inventory, factor accounts receivable, or renegotiate lease agreements. Lining up similar support for projects it considers more uncertain creates the anxiety of compromising its status. This implies that, while VC firms with high finance capacity avoid early-stage investments, those with high status among them would have an even stronger incentive to do so.  \n\nHypothesis 3. VC firm status strengthens the negative relationship between finance capacity and the decision to invest in early-stage ventures.  \n\n## 4. Method  \n\n### 4.1. Sample  \n\nWe designed the study with four factors in mind. First, we required VC firms that faced decisions to invest in the “same” industry (Wireless Communication), but an industry that provided considerable choice of portfolio companies at different stages of development. Second, we required VC firms that have made a sufficient number of investments, so that enough data would be available to infer the top managers? various investment choices. Third, since background data were to be collected on current team members, we had to limit the time period examined so that it would be reasonable to attribute the investment decisions made over the selected period to the identified team members. Finally, we limited our analysis to independent VC firms since subsidiaries of financial or other corporations are likely to have goals and/or strategies imposed on its team by the parent company. Thus, we used Thomson Financial's VentureXpert database to create a sampling frame of all independent VC firms in the US that have invested in at least 20 portfolio companies over the 1997-2002 period, with at least one investment in the Wireless Communication industry. From this list of 252 VC firms, we collected information on a random selection of 108 firms.  \n\nBecause the 1997-2002 period was quite distinct in the development of the US VC industry, with a rapid increase of investment activity between 1997 and 2000 and a rapid decline thereafter, we needed to ensure that it would not affect the generalization of our results. Figure 1 shows the proportion of first-time early-stage investments by US VC firms over the period 1980-2002 as well as the proportion of early-stage investments by our sample firms over the 1997-2002 period. The figure shows that the proportion of first-time earlystage investments diminishes over time, especially in the latter part of the 1990s. This may be indeed due to the gradual increase in funds under management, leading to higher deal sizes, as well as to the large number of new entrants in the VC industry in the 1990s. Nevertheless, for our particular sample VC firms, given that they tend to be bigger and thus more experienced, the level of early-stage investing in the 1997-2002 period is more consistent with the earlier industry development and also follows the overall industry pattern?.  \n\n# Insert Figure 1 about here  \n\n### 4.2. Measures  \n\n#### 4.2.1 Dependent variable  \n\nAs is commonly done in the VC community, the VentureXpert database classified investments into stages, representing an increasing degree of development. We used six main categories to represent a portfolio company's development stage: (1) seed, (2) start-up, (3) other early stage, (4) expansion, (5) later/acquisition, and (6) other late stage. We measured the extent to which the VC firm managers chose to invest in early-stage ventures as the proportion of first-time investments made by the VC firm in companies at the seed, start-up or other early stage. We focused on the first-time investments (i.e. when a VC firm invests in a particular company for the first time) in order to exclude from consideration the repeated investments by a VC firm in the same company (i.e. follow-on investments).  \n\n#### 4.2.2 Independent variables  \n\nWe operationalized finance capacity as the extent to which team members have worked in finance industries - commercial, investment, and merchant banking as well as investment fund management, in both public and private markets. These industries are especially relevant for the VC context since they represent a major career path for entry into the VC industry. Because decisions in such industries are often based on sophisticated modelling of various market processes and their associated risks, there is much reliance on historical information in estimating various prediction parameters. For example, one of the most popular parameters reflects the volatility of a particular asset (its beta) and is typically derived by regressing the daily returns of the asset on the overall market's daily returns. This provides validity for our notion of finance capacity as associated with preferences for more precise estimation of risks and returns.  \n\nData on the experiences of the team were collected from the VC firm's website. Our operational definition of team was all people holding the title “general partner”’ or, in the absence of such a title, the highest ranking title in the firm hierarchy, such as, “partners\", \"managing directors\", “directors\", and “principals\". The total number of team members on whom data were collected was 731, which represents an average of 6.8 members per team. We coded each team member for whether he or she had worked in the finance industries listed above, and then calculated a score representing the proportion of team members that have worked in these industries. For example, a score of 0.35 indicates that $35\\%$ of the team members have worked in finance related industries 4.  \n\nWhile the above measure does not fully capture the qualitative differences in finance capacity due to individual team members? different lengths of experience in finance-related industries, there are several considerations related to the particular ways in which we have executed our study that attenuate this concern. First, our conception of finance capacity pertains to how “dominating” the finance experience is for the top management team as a whole. In this regard, when examined at the group level, i.e. across all general partners, the effect of the experience of individual people oscillates less. This is reinforced by the fact that our sample firms tend to be older and larger, and thus have on average more experienced partners. Second, as the descriptive statistics below suggest, finance experience tends not to be mixed with other experience. Therefore, by including more experienced partners, our sample is less susceptible to wide variation in the number of years of finance experience. Our approach here is consistent with recent work that uses a team-level representation of the backgrounds of the individual TMT members (Higgins and Gulati, 2006).  \n\nIn measuring reputation as a reflection of past performance, we captured both evidence of past investment activity and media visibility. We captured such activity by the following three items: the total amount of invested capital by the VC firm, the total number of companies in its portfolio, and its age. This is consistent with other measurements of VC reputation (Gulati and Higgins, 2003; Gompers, 1996). We measured media visibility by the number of times the firm had been mentioned in The Wall Street Journal over the period of the study (1997-2002). Thus, our overall measure of reputation was a composite variable consisting of the three items for past investment activity and the item for visibility. The reliability of this measure was within the accepted limits (alpha $=.72\\$  \n\nWe measured a VC firm's status using Bonacich's (1987) power centrality measure, which is consistent with recent research on the network positions of VC firms (Podolny, 2001; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001). Based on this measure, the status of a firm is dependent on the number and status of other firms with which it has participated in financing particular portfolio companies. In order to produce an unbiased measure of status, we examined the pattern of co-investment not among the firms in our sample, but within the group of all active VC firms over the period of the study. We considered a firm an active investor if it conducted at least five deals per year (Podolny, 2001). Therefore, we calculated the status measure using the 563 VC firms that had invested in at least 30 portfolio companies during the 1997-2002 period, to capture all active investors. The measure, $\\mathrm{c}_{\\mathrm{i}}(\\upalpha,\\upbeta)$ takes the form: $\\mathsf{c}_{\\mathrm{i}}(\\mathsf{a},\\mathsf{\\upbeta})=\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{j}}$ $(\\mathsf{a}{+}\\mathsf{\\beta})\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{ij}}$ ,where ${\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{ij}}$ is an element of a relational matrix R, representing the number of companies in which firms i and j have invested together over the period of the study. The parameter $\\upalpha$ is for arbitrary scaling of the measure, while $\\upbeta$ represents the degree to which the centrality of firm i is a function of the centralities of other firms in the network. Following recommendations for setting $\\upbeta$ at less than the reciprocal of the largest eigenvalue of R  \n\n(Borgatti, Everett, and Freeman, 2002), we set $\\upbeta$ equal to three quarters of the largest eigenvalue (see Podolny, 1993; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001). We calculated Bonacich's power centrality scores for each VC firm and normalized the scores so that the highest score was equal to 1 and the lowest to O. The higher a firm's score the higher its status.  \n\n#### 4.2.3 Control variables  \n\nIn choosing control variables, we sought to eliminate various alternative explanations based on findings in the economic sociology, upper echelon, and entrepreneurship literatures. First, consistent with Podolny (2001), we controlled for the informational benefits that an organization's social network might bestow. In particular, the more structural holes there are in an organization's network the broader the range of market opportunities to which an organization has access (Burt, 1992). We measured structural holes using the method proposed by Burt (1992), which captures the proportion of an organization's network activity that involves ties that are not redundant. The higher a score on this measure the more structural holes in the VC firm's network.  \n\nSecond, consistent with the literature on top management team demography, we controlled for several team factors including a team's functional diversity, diversity of prior industry experience, team size, founder tenure, and entrepreneurial experience. The diversity of an organization's TMT has been identified as having a major influence on important organizational decisions (Bantel and Jackson, 1989; Hambrick and Mason, 1984). In particular, the functional diversity of TMT members has been shown to capture important decision making effects stemming from the team's composition (Hambrick, Cho, and Chen, 1996). In measuring TMT diversity we kept to established conventions in the literature while making allowances for the unique context of the VC industry. A large number of professionals entering the VC industry come from the finance industries described above. These industries are unique in that they do not have the traditional functional separations of other industries (e.g. operations, R&D, human resources, sales and marketing, etc.). As a consequence, we used a coarser set of functional areas for categorizing each TMT members? prior functional experience: sales and marketing, accounting and finance, and operations. These categories broadly reflect the distinctions made by Hambrick and Mason (1984) between output, throughput, and peripheral functions. We coded each TMT member on whether he or she had had experience in any of these functional areas, and then calculated the proportion of TMT members that had had experience in each functional category. We then measured functional diversity using Blau's (1977) method, ${1-\\Sigma{\\mathfrak{p}}_{\\mathrm{i}}}^{2}$ ,where $\\mathfrak{p}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is the proportion of TMT members with experience in a particular functional area. Because our coding allowed for more than one experience per team member, we rescaled the $\\mathfrak{p}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ scores used in the formula above so that they would add up to one.  \n\nThe VC industry is also unique in that TMT members come from a variety of industries. Therefore, we complemented our measure of functional diversity with a measure of the diversity of prior industry experience among TMT members. We used the same procedure described above for functional diversity, with the following industry categories: finance industries, non-finance industries, consulting, law, and entrepreneurship (having founded a company). In order to account for the possible effects of TMT size on our diversity measures, we also controlled for team size, measured as the number of general partners.  \n\nThe organizational tenure of TMT members can promote or deter an organization in conducting innovation - longer-tenured teams make strategic choices that adhere to established decision-making routines that impede innovation (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1990; Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Controlling for the average tenure of TMT members accounts for the degree to which decision-making within the TMT is routinized. Because we lacked detailed information on the tenure of each TMT member, we calculated the proportion of TMT members that were founders of the VC firm. Because organizational founders carry the institutional spirit of the organization's initial strive for legitimacy (Stinchcombe, 1965), they create a lasting imprint on the organization's decision processes (Boeker, 1989). Therefore, the extent to which founders are still present on the TMT captures the relative rigidity of decision-making processes within the TMT°.  \n\nLast among our control variables on particular characteristics of the TMT was the proportion of team members with prior entrepreneurial experience. Ventures at the earliest stages of development are often newly founded and led by ambitious entrepreneurs. To the extent that team members have had such experience in the past, they likely have a better understanding of the complexities of start-up and emerging environments, and may be more inclined to invest in these early stage portfolio companies. In measuring prior entrepreneurial experience, we coded each TMT member for whether he or she had previously founded a company and calculated the proportion of team members that have done so.  \n\nFinally, we accounted for the differences in investment opportunities available to the VC firms. On one hand, such differences stem from the VC firm's prior investment activity and developed expertise - early-stage deals may not be equally accessible by all VC firms. In order to control for deal flow availability, we included two variables: the number of first-time deals executed prior to 1997 and the proportion of these deals that were early-stage. On the other hand, VC firms focusing on different industries may also have different exposure to early-stage deals. Therefore, in order to account for between-industry differences in sources and number of opportunities (Klevorick, Levin, Nelson, and Winter, 1995), we controlled for the industry of the investments. In particular, we acknowledge that the majority of early stage investments tend to be in high-technology industries. Therefore, we used two such industry groups based on the industry classifications of VentureXpert database - ICT (including  \n\ncommunications, computer related, semiconductors and electronics) and Medical/Biotech (including medical and pharmaceutical, and biotechnology) - and created variables representing the proportion of investments made in each of these industry categories.  \n\n## 5. Results  \n\nTable 1 presents the correlations and descriptive statistics for the variables. To test the hypotheses, we used OLS regression analysis. Our diagnostic tests indicated that the data did not violate the assumptions of linearity, normality, homoskedasticity, and independence necessary for an unbiased and efficient OLS estimation?. In addition, we identified 4 multivariate outliers in the dataset using the method developed by Hadi (1992) and a strict significance level $(\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{p}}<\\boldsymbol{.001})$ . Our examination revealed that these outliers pertained to some of the largest buyout firms. Given the distinction made between buyout and venture capital investing (e.g., Wright and Robbie, 1998), we excluded these outliers from further analysis.  \n\nThe results of the regression analysis are reported in Table 2. In the first estimation, we entered the control variables for industry, investment activity prior to 1997, TMT characteristics, and structural holes. This base model explained a statistically significant share of the variance in the proportion of early-stage investments in the VC firms portfolios $({\\mathbb{R}}^{2}=$ .52, $\\mathbf{p}<.001,$ . Next, we added the main effects for finance capacity, reputation, and status. The variables improved the model fit over the base model $(\\Delta\\mathbf{R}^{2}=.04,\\mathrm{p}<.05)$ .Hypothesis 1 proposed a negative relationship between finance capacity and early-stage investing. The effect of finance capacity was negative and significant $(\\upbeta=\\gim.30,\\upbeta<.01)_{,}$ -higher finance capacity was associated with fewer investments in early-stage companies (and hence more investments in late-stage companies)\\*. This provides support for hypothesis 1. The main  \n\neffects for reputation and status were not significant $(\\upbeta=-.13,\\upnu>.10$ and $\\upbeta=-.06,\\upbeta>.10$ ， respectively).  \n\nInsert Tables 1 and 2 about here  \n\nFinally, we estimated the full model by adding the interaction terms for finance capacity and reputation and for finance capacity and status. In order to reduce the collinearity of the interaction terms, we computed them by using the mean-centered values of finance capacity, reputation, and status. We ensured that multicollinearity did not affect the results by calculating variance inflation factors - the highest value was 8.35, which was well within the accepted limits (cf. Hair, Anderson, Tatham, and Black, 1998).  \n\nAs the full model shows, the interactions explained a significant amount of the variance over and above the main-effects model $(\\Delta\\mathbf{R}^{2}{=}.05,\\mathrm{p}<.01)$ and further reinforced the negative effect of finance capacity $(\\upbeta=-.33,\\upnu<.01)$ . Specifically, the interactions of finance capacity with both reputation $(\\beta=.33,\\mathrm{p}<.05)$ and status $(\\beta=-.48,\\mathrm{p}<.001)$ were significant. In order to examine the nature of these interactions, we followed the recommendation of Cohen and Cohen (1983) and plotted the effects of finance capacity on early-stage investments for reputation and status values of one standard deviation above and below their means. The interaction plots are shown in Figures 2 and 3. As Figure 2 shows, with increasing levels of finance capacity there is a decrease in the proportion of early-stage investments but this decrease is greater for low-reputation firms than for high-reputation firms. This suggests that as a VC firm's finance capacity increases, it is more likely to avoid early-stage investments (i.e. allocate its funds to late-stage investments) if it has a low reputation. This alleviating effect of reputation is opposite to that offered in hypothesis 2.  \n\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, with increasing levels of finance capacity there is a decrease in the proportion of early-stage investments and this decrease is greater for highstatus firms than for low-status firms. This suggests that for VC firms with high finance capacity, those with high status are even more likely to avoid early-stage investments. This enhancing effect of status provides support for hypothesis 3.  \n\nInsert Figures 2 and 3 about here  \n\n## 6. Discussion and conclusion  \n\nThe results of this paper suggest that investment choices are strongly influenced by the type of expertise possessed by the VC firm's management team. In addition, this expertise-choice relationship is moderated by the VC firm's social standing - its dynamics change as the firm's reputation or status increase. While the current research view of venture capitalists is predominantly as homogeneous decision makers, the theoretical insights of this paper add important team- and firm-specific elements to our understanding of the VC decision making process. These in turn allow us to more rigorously and systematically understand why equally aspiring VC firms make different investment choices. Such differences arise, in part, from differences in how management teams interpret and react to the market information brought by prospective ventures. Interpretation and reaction are thus endogenous to the decision making process - they are largely dependent on decision makers' expertise and the social standing of their firm. We thus demonstrate how the inclusion of psychological and sociological constructs can enrich the study of venture capital decision making, long studied only through the lenses of finance.  \n\nMore broadly, this work builds on and extends research suggesting that a team's variety must be “requisite” to the complexities and challenges posed by the sub-environments that the organization faces (Vogus and Sutcliffe, 2003). In addition, it adds fuel to arguments that researchers need to move beyond the assumption that the environment is an undifferentiated whole (Vogus and Sutcliffe, 2003). For example, this sample of VC firms faced the “same” environment, but there was variance among these firms in terms of the subenvironments (investment stages) in which they chose to invest. Finance capacity explained a significant portion of this variance. It better equips VC firms to examine and select late-stage deals and thus, to the extent that it is not offset by other experiences, steers them away from early-stage deals. However, our findings also suggest that a main-effects-only relationship is too simplistic; it is also dependent on the VC firm's status and reputation. We thus contribute to the upper echelon perspective (Hambrick and Mason, 1984) by highlighting the moderating role of an organization's external image and social position in top management team decision processes.  \n\nAs expected, organizational status magnified the negative relationship between the management team's finance capacity and investing in early-stage ventures. We followed Podolny (2001) by investigating the VC industry, but while he focused on the effects of within-firm changes in status, we focused on between-firm differences in status. Our contributing finding is that while some high-status VC firms avoid early-stage ventures (consistent with Podolny [2001]), others prefer them. The distinguishing factor between the two is the management team's finance capacity. As status offers privileges that are not based on merit (Washington and Zajac, 2005), our results suggest that these privileges are not easily extended in all contexts - firms would not exert such privileges in situations where their expertise clashes with the particular merit basis. To the extent that being involved in areas where one lacks expertise could lead to negative outcomes, such an action may also be seen as a way of avoiding negative association that could ultimately undermine one's status.  \n\nContrary to what we expected, we found that reputation moderated the relationship between the finance capacity of the VC firm's management team and early-stage investing. Less reputable firms with high finance capacity made fewer early-stage investments than their more reputable counterparts. A possible explanation for this initially surprising finding might involve the notion of slack resources, generally defined as the pool of resources in excess of the minimum needed to produce a given level of organizational output (Nohria and Gulati, 1996). As reputation reflects good prior performance (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990), firms with higher reputation may have higher accumulations of slack resources. These resources may in turn enable them to engage in experimentation (Cyert and March, 1963) and in implementation of new strategies (Hambrick and Snow, 1977). Thus, where slack resources are available top managers have greater discretion to act (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1990; Levinthal and March, 1981). In the context of VC firms, the slack resources generated by its reputation may encourage VC firms to make “experimental\" investments, i.e., those that fall outside the scope of their current investment strategy as characterized by their requisite expertise. The above argument is consistent with findings that reputation lowers the entry barriers into innovative domains (Carow, 1999).  \n\nAlternatively, the positive moderating effect of reputation may be explained by the VCs’ beliefs that they can influence the success of the portfolio company. Although a VC firm may not have the requisite expertise for early-stage investments, its high reputation may enable it to attract the necessary expertise externally. In addition, reputable VC firms may attract better-quality ventures (Shane and Cable, 2002), which serves as additional alleviation of the lack of requisite expertise.  \n\nThe differential effects for status and reputation also raise some interesting possibilities about the ways in which these two constructs are related to one another. Although they each represent an aspect of perceived quality, our results suggest that they a.  \n\ntapping into different facets of this underlying construct. The position in a social network (status) seems to put a damper on behavior perhaps because it represents TMT's consideration for consistency between behavior and social position - “we need to protect our position! On the other hand, reputation appears to do the opposite and may reflect a TMT's proactive adaptation, as represented by the notion of experimentation (Cyert and March, 1963). By including both status and reputation as separate measures, we were able to evaluate the influence of social position and capture reputation effects.  \n\nWith this study, we open the door to examining the interaction between intra-and inter-organizational cognition (reputation and status ordering). This creates several possibilities for future research into the relationship between an organization's reputation and status and its perception of various dimensions of the environment. While researchers have shown that some aspects of the environment are commonly perceived within industries, others, like hostility and controllability are not (Sutcliffe and Huber, 1998). The findings of this paper suggest that there may be reputation and/or status-based clustering in withinindustry perceptions that can be uncovered by future research. This may be particularly relevant to the VC industry where top VC firms are often associated with the emergence of new technologies. Further, while TMT composition is currently used as an exogenous predictor of organizations? perceptions and actions (Hambrick and Mason, 1984), our findings suggest that there may be reputation and/or status-related considerations affecting the composition of top management teams.  \n\nAs with all studies there are a number of limitations to our study. First, although theory and previous longitudinal research have suggested the causal direction hypothesized here, the cross-sectional nature of our study does not allow us to rule out the possibility of reverse causality. Second, we have not considered the possible effects of a potential venture's reputation. For ventures started by renowned scientists or entrepreneurs there may be different dynamics to the investment selection process than those alluded to in the paper. Third, by taking a single snapshot of the management team, we were not able to consider the effects of changes in the management team composition prior to our study and within the specified investment period. Although the VC industry is not a high-turnover one (especially at the general partner level), there nevertheless remains a possibility that some of the team members were not involved in all the investments over the study period. Finally, we selected a sample that reduced possible confounding factors but in doing so limited the generalizability of our results. For those that do wish to relate the findings to the broader population of VC firms, we point out that the firms in our sample tend to be older and larger than those in the broader population, e.g., this sample includes half of the top 100 and 40 percent of the top 200 VC firms.  \n\nThere are also a number of practical implications that emerge from our study. From the VC firm perspective, the results provide insight into how their management team expertise and social standing affect their deal flow and ultimate investment selection. From the perspective of the recipient of venture capital, our results suggest that entrepreneurs looking for early-stage financing for their ventures would be well served by an in-depth examination of the management expertise of their potential VC firms. Given the strong network repercussion of a “no decision\" it pays to be exposed to the “right\" VC firm early o1  \n\nIn conclusion, there is a long-standing debate in the organizational and management literatures on the internal versus external determinism of organizational outcomes. Although there is implicit acceptance of the idea that the two are somehow intertwined in the complex picture of organizational reality, researchers predominantly focus on one to the exclusion of the other. We have shown that by combining both sets of considerations our explanatory power greatly increases. More generally, the integration of complementary perspectives is a fruitful avenue for advancing organizational research.  \n\n#  \n\n/. Kelerences   \nAmit, R., Brander, J.,Zot, C. 1998.

In view of the increased focus on venture capital firms (VcFs) as important stakeholders for entrepreneurial ventures, in this study we examined the relationship between VCFs' investment strategies and their portfolio failure rates. We examined two aspects of a VcF's investment strategy: (1) the extent to which the VCF develops specialized expertise and (2) the extent to which the VCF undertakes investments in cooperation with other investors through syndication. We tested our hypotheses on longitudinal data of the realized strategies of 2oo U.S.-based VcFs over a 12-year period. We found that a VCF's specialized development stage expertise had a negative effect on the proportion of defaults in the VcF's portfolio. We also found that the level of syndication positively—-rather than negatively—affected the proportion of defaults. We discuss our findings from both theoretical and practical points of view.  \n\n## Introduction  \n\nStarting a new venture is an activity that entails a high level of risk. As a consequence, the failure rates for new businesses are far from trivial, hovering around $40\\%$ in the first year and evenup to $90\\%$ over 10 years (Timmons, 1990). While a better understanding of the factors that contribute to new venture failure represents a critical aspect of entrepreneurship studies, the entrepreneurship literature has spent disproportionately more attention on success stories and factors rather than on new business failures (Deakins, 1996). Failure is often viewed from a negative perspective even if it is considered an important characteristic of the entrepreneurial reality (McGrath, 1999). One likely difficulty in examining new venture failure stems from the lack of access to (financial) data on failed businesses. In addition, even if researchers can identify failed entrepreneurs, these entrepreneurs may be very resistant to discussing their experiences or may be unable to articulate the factors that contributed to the failure, particularly if a long period of time has passed since the failure took place (Bruno & Leidecker, 1987). Nevertheless, given the importance of new business failure in the economic reality, there is definitely a need to get a better understanding of factors that drive or—-more interestingly--diminish entrepreneurial failure (McGrath, 1999; Zacharakis, Meyer, & De Castro, 1999).  \n\nPrior research has suggested that an important driver for new venture failure is the venture's “liability of newness\" (Stinchcombe, 1965). More specifically, new firms are particularly likely to fail because they have not had the time to develop internal performance routines and working relationships. In addition, new ventures lack external legitimacy with potential investors, buyers, suppliers, employees, and other stakeholders (Stuart, Hoang, & Hybels, 1999). An important vehicle for new firms to overcome their liability of newness is the formation of cooperative relationships with other firms. These cooperative relationships may allow young firms to access critical resources and knowledge (Baum & Oliver, 1991). Further, relationships with others can also act as signals of increased legitimacy for emerging ventures (Stuart et al., 1999).  \n\nIn regard to the possible stakeholders that may stimulate new venture performance, there has been research interest in the role and contribution of venture capital firms (VCFs) in enhancing new venture survival and success (e.g., Baum & Silverman, 2004; Dimov & Shepherd, 2005; Elango, Fried, Hisrich, & Polonchek, 1995; Hellman & Puri, 2002; Sapienza, Amason, & Manigart, 1994; Sapienza, Manigart, & Vermeir, 1996). However, while this research has pointed to the positive contribution of VCFs as a group in terms of preventing new venture failure, there has been much less focus on the differences among VCFs in doing so. We contend that because VCFs differ in the amount and nature of expertise they possess, some VCFs may be more able than others to prevent the failure of their portfolio companies (Dimov & Shepherd, 2005). Furthermore, such differences, in terms of expertise, are likely to be related to differences in the investment strategies pursued by VCFs.  \n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine—through a longitudinal design—the effects of VCFs’ investment strategies on the failure rates in their portfolios. Our unit of analysis is the portfolio of a VCF. We focus on two specific strategic choices that VCFs face—-(1) developing specialized expertise and (2) investing together with syndicate partners—and we analyze the effect of these choices on the extent of failure within their portfolios. Our empirical data consists of the realized investments (i.e., investment strategies) of 200 independent VCFs over a 12-year period (1990-2001). We contribute to the literature on venture survival by adding a novel understanding of the differences among VCFs in enhancing such survival.  \n\nThe article is organized as follows. In the next section, we present a theoretical framework for VCFs’ contribution to new venture survival and develop specific hypotheses. In the following section we present our methodology and results. Finally, we discuss our findings from both a theoretical and practical perspective and offer some concluding comments.  \n\n### Theory and Hypotheses  \n\nA significant stream of research has emphasized the “coach\" role that VCFs perform (Baum & Silverman, 2004). In particular, venture success is often attributed to the ability of VCFs to manage their portfolio companies through the staging of disbursements (Gompers, 1995), oversight, and board representation (Lerner, 1995), as well as involvement in recruiting key managers (Hellman & Puri, 2002). Several studies have examined in more detail the active role that VCs may play in the postinvestment phase. For instance, a distinction has been made between three categories of venture capitalists, i.e., the \"inactive” investors, the “active advice givers,”’ and the “hands-on” investors (Elango et al., 1995), with the latter category attaching most importance to venture-assisting activities (e.g., seeking additional financing, recruiting management, helping with operational planning, or serving as the entrepreneur's confidant). Furthermore, others have suggested the following three key roles played by VCFs in their relationship with portfolio companies: (a) a strategic role as sounding boards for and generators of strategic initiatives, (b) an operational role as providers of key external contacts for locating managerial recruits, professional service providers, or key customers, and (c) a personal role as friends, mentors, and confidants (Sapienza et al., 1994; Sapienza et al., 1996).  \n\nWhile the effectiveness of postinvestment management may be partially attributed to the VCF's ability, there is also a strategic choice facing the VCF in terms of how much involvement to undertake in each of its portfolio companies (Elango et al., 1995). Because VCFs are driven by maximizing the returns of the funds they raise, their often crucial involvement may be lacking for ventures that do not provide prospects of high or adequate returns, turning them into “living dead\" (Ruhnka, Feldman, & Dean, 1992). Prior research has indeed indicated that VCFs often attempt to devote as much time as possible to their \"home runs,’ i.e., those deals that generate the majority of their returns (Sahlman, 1990; Sapienza et al., 1994). Gifford (1997) also pointed out that venture capitalists face serious time allocation dilemmas with regard to supporting portfolio companies, raising new funds, and locating and closing new investment deals. Therefore, a VCF may pick and choose where to allocate its time so as to optimize its own outcomes, possibly at the expense (or benefit) of a given portfolio company (Gifford, 1997). As a result, when VCFs make a conscious choice of reduced involvement in their portfolio companies (PFC), the consequences for venture survival may be gruesome.  \n\nTo a large extent, the difficulties associated with effective postinvestment involvement stem from the uncertainty that VCFs face in selecting their investments. It is now well established in the literature that VCFs use different strategies to manage this uncertainty. In particular, they may specialize (Amit, Brander, & Zott, 1998; Gupta & Sapienza, 1992) or syndicate (Bygrave, 1987; Lerner, 1994) their investments as means of reducing deal-related uncertainty and agency risks as well as of enhancing the quality of their investment judgment or value added. In this study, we accordingly reason that the degree of postinvestment involvement, and thus its effectiveness, may be linked to the extent to which these two strategies are used by a focal VCF. Subsequently, we discuss the effects of these two strategies on the proportion of failures within the VCF's portfolio.  \n\n### Specialized Expertise and Venture Failure  \n\nAn organization's capability to prevent failure is inherently related to learning from past failures (Levitt & March, 1988). Indeed, in the venture capital context, there is evidence that prior deal-related experience of the VCFs’ top management teams contributes to higher survival among their portfolio companies (Dimov & Shepherd, 2005). In addition, learning outcomes increase when a firm assimilates new knowledge that is related to its existing knowledge structure (Bower & Hilgard, 1981; Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). This suggests that failure-related learning may be more effective for VCFs that develop specialized expertise in regard to their portfolio investments.  \n\nPrior researchers have pointed out that a VCF may leverage its knowledge and experience across multiple PFCs by investing in specific types of ventures (De Clercq, Goulet, Kumpulainen, & Makela, 2001; Gupta & Sapienza, 1992; Norton and Tenenbaum, 1993). A VCF's specialization strategy may be represented by the development of expertise in areas such as a particular venture development stage or a particular industry (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992; Norton & Tenenbaum, 1993). These two areas constitute dimensions along which the VCF, through its strategic decisions, develops its portfolio overtime.  \n\nThere are several ways in which a VCF's specialized expertise may reduce the failure rate of its portfolio investments. First, specialized expertise facilitates the control that the VCF exercises over the management of the new venture (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992). In turn, such control allows, for instance, for an easier detection of deteriorating venture performance and thus, a more timely undertaking of corrective measures. Second, specialized expertise allows for a better understanding of the complexities that are associated with particular developments stages or industries, and these insights can then be used to manage similar investments more effectively (De Clercq et al., 2001). Indeed, as the organizational learning literature indicates, failure may be reduced through the development of learning curve effects (Argote, 1996). More specifically to the context of our study, VCFs that continuously invest in particular types of ventures can maximally benefit from such learning curve effects through the accumulation of superior knowledge over time and can therefore reduce the likelihood of venture failure (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992; Hall & Hofer, 1993; Norton & Tenenbaum, 1993). New venture failure is less likely to occur, for instance, when VCFs better understand the critical success factors related to particular development stages of their portfolio companies or the competitive dynamics of particular industries. In short, the development of particular expertise through an investment specialization strategy enhances the learning capability of a given VCF (i.e., the \"focal VCF1), and thus decreases the proportion of failures in its portfolio.  \n\nHypothesis 1: The focal VCF's specialized expertise is negatively related to the failure rate of its portfolio.  \n\n### Investment Syndication and Venture Failure  \n\nThe second aspect of the VCF's investment strategy on which we focus pertains to the extent to which it engages in syndication partnerships. Prior research has shown that venture capitalists often “coinvest” with others when allocating capital to new ventures (e.g., Brander, Amit, & Antweiler, 2002; Bygrave, 1987, 1988; Lerner, 1994; Lockett & Wright, 2001). Investment syndication pertains to the simultaneous investment by at least two VCFs in the same venture within the same investment round (Bygrave, 1987; Lerner, 1994; Wright & Lockett, 2003). Subsequently, we argue that there may be equally compelling arguments for a negative as well as for a positive effect of syndication on venturefailure.  \n\nThe arguments for a negative effect of syndication on venture failure stem from the (potentially) more effective knowledge input that several (rather than only one) VCFs can provide to their portfolio companies, thereby enhancing these companies’ survival chances. That is, the greater the number of partners in the syndicate, the greater the diversity of available expertise and thus, the higher the likelihood that a particular critical piece of information or advice can be promptly accessed. For instance, since different syndicate members may contribute different sets of capabilities that are potentially useful to a particular venture (e.g., particular management or operational expertise, or access to potential customers, top managers, and other investors), more syndication increases the value added to the venture (Brander et al., 2002) as well as improves venture selection (Lerner, 1994).  \n\nTherefore, the wider knowledge base that the syndicate provides allows for the knowledge effects discussed in hypothesis 1 to be enhanced even further. Also, with more than one VCF involved, there is a higher likelihood of more overall investor involvement with the venture. Such involvement, in turn, may further enhance venture survival. Prior research on venture capital financing has indeed found that ventures’ rating of VCFs' knowledge input is positively related to the amount of involvement by the investors in the portfolio company (Sapienza, 1992). Finally, for a venture that is managed by a syndicate, there may be a higher chance that deteriorating performance (if it occurs) is detected and that solutions are found to correct such deterioration. Accordingly, we put forth the following hypothesis:  \n\nHypothesis 2a: The extent to which a focal VCF syndicates its investments is negatively related to the failure rate of its portfolio.  \n\nContrary to the above survival-enhancing effect of syndication, we suggest that there may also be a failure-enhancing effect of syndication. Rather than focusing on the potential benefits of diversity in expertise and information that the syndicate brings, this second argument highlights the interpartner dynamics inherent to the investment syndicate. We focus on two particular processes, escalation of commitment and social loafing, that may create traction within the syndicate.  \n\nPrior research has argued that VCFs may withdraw support from ventures that turn out not to hold promise for a high return, thereby rendering them into a “living dead\" status (Ruhnka et al., 1992). However, for portfolio companies that face failure, survival can be enhanced if the VCF maintains its commitment to the company, despite the negative performance signals. The notion of escalation of commitment pertains to a VCF's continued involvement with a portfolio company despite the latter's deteriorating performance (Birmingham, Busenitz, & Arthurs, 2003). With such escalated commitment, the continued hope by the VCF for an ultimately positive outcome for its investment may protract the declaration of bankruptcy and thus, the registration of default. Such hope is driven by self-justification, i.e., the need to prove to others that one is competent and rational (Staw, 1980). A main precondition for this self-justification motive is the perception of personal responsibility for the negative performance (Staw, 1976). However, research has shown that there is less perceived personal responsibility in group decision making compared with individual decision making (e.g., Mynatt & Sherman, 1975). This suggests that, for a given VCF, perceived responsibility for the portfolio company's failure is highest when the VCF is the sole investor in the PFC. Therefore, when the focal VCF is part of an investment syndicate, escalation of commitment may be lower, and ventures facing failure may be pushed into bankruptcy proceedings because the VCF (and its coinvestors) will hope to salvage some value. There is indeed evidence that the greater the number of VCFs involved in the first-round funding of a venture, the lower the likelihood of escalation of commitment in later rounds (Birmingham et al., 2003).  \n\nA related argument for the positive——-rather than negative——effect of syndication on venture failure can be drawn from the literature on collective action and social loafing (e.g., Earley, 1989; Olson, 1965; Wagner, 1995). The phenomenon of social loafing pertains to the reduced efforts of actors who act as part of a group rather than alone (Harkins & Petty, 1982). For instance, prior studies have shown that individuals who believed they performed a task in conjunction with others, although they were actually performing alone, engaged in less efforts compared with individuals who believed they acted alone (e.g., Latane, Williams, & Harkins, 1979). In the context of our study, we reason that for any given portfolio company, the focal VCF trades off its own effort with the potential effort undertaken by its coinvestors. There is thus a significant agency cost involved in coordinating decisions and portfolio company involvement among the syndicate members (Wright & Lockett, 2003). Given the serious time allocation dilemmas that venture capitalists face with regard to supporting portfolio companies, raising new funds, and locating and closing new investment deals (Gifford, 1997), we reason then that the effort reduction is highest when a focal VCF deals with a portfolio company facing potential failure. That is, the focal VCF is less likely to be higly involved with a venture that is in trouble when the VCF is part of an investment syndicate. As a result, all else being equal, syndication may lead to relatively more defaults in the VCF's portfolio.  \n\nHypothesis 2b: The extent to which a focal VCF syndicates its investments is positively related to the failure rate of its portfolio.  \n\n## Methodology  \n\n### Data Collection  \n\nIn order to make an assessment of the failure rate of VCFs’ investments over time, we selected VCFs that had already made a substantial number of investments. Our initial population consisted of all independent U.S.-based VCFs that had invested in at least 20 portfolio companies, as reported in the VentureXpert database published by Thomson Financial. From the resulting 547 VCFs, we randomly selected 200 “focal VCFs. For each of these 200 vCFs, we collected data on their “first-time rounds\"” (i.e., the rounds at which the VCFs invested in their portfolio companies for the first time) over the period 1990-2001. A total of 10,057 investment rounds were so identified. These rounds provide an image of the realization of the focal VCFs’ investment strategies as they contain all the points at which portfolio companies joined the VCFs’ investment portfolios. On average over the period 1990-2001, a VCF in our data set made seven first-time investments per year (with a standard deviation of 8.2) for the years in which it has been active (i.e., has made at least one investment).  \n\nFor each of the first-time rounds, we collected the following information: the founding date, stage of development, and industry of the portfolio company; the number of coinvestors in the round, the date of the round, and the number of the investment round (refecting how many previous infusions of venture capital the portfolio company had received); and the focal VCF's age. These data were then grouped according to the year in which the first-time rounds took place, i.e., 12 groups in total (1990-2001). For each of the $200\\mathrm{VCFs}$ and each of the 12 years, we calculated the following average values for all the first-time investments that the VCF had undertaken in that particular year: number of coinvestors, PFC development stage, PFC age, and round number. In addition, we recorded the public status of each portfolio company at the time of the data collection.  \n\n### Measures  \n\nDependent Variable. We measured the failure rate of the focal VCF's portfolio by the proportion of defaults among companies that have been added to the VCF portfolio in a given year. Thus, e.g., the failure rate for a given VCF for 1995 pertains to the proportion of defaults occurring among the portfolio companies in which the VCF had invested for the first time in 1995. We calculated the failure rate for each VCF and for each year of observation. Since the investment strategy parameters for the VCF were also calculated for each of the years in the 1990-2001 time period, the default measure was thus directly related to the particular strategic input for each year. In calculating the proportion of defaults, we first obtained information from the VentureXpert database on the status of each portfolio company as of the time of the data collection. We regarded a company as defaulted if its status was listed as “defunct.\" In the VentureXpert database, a company is classified as \"defunct’ if it has filed for bankruptcy or has simply ceased trading. We then counted the number of defaulted companies for each VCF and for each year, and divided this count by the total number of first-time investments that the VCF had made in the particular year.  \n\nIndependent Variables. The focal VCF's specialized expertise was assessed on two dimensions, i.e., development stage and industry. We measured the focal VCFs’ specialized industry knowledge by calculating the relative industry specialization of its first-time investments made in a particular year. To do this, we assigned the PFCs industries to one of nine potential categories based on Venture Economics’ classification system for industries: (1) communications, (2) computer related, (3) electronics, (4) biotechnology, (5) medical/pharmaceutical, (6) energy, (7) consumer related, (8) industrial/chemical, and (9) other manufacturing and services. Similarly, in measuring specialized stage knowledge, we assigned the PFCs development stages to one of six categories used by Venture Economics to represent a continuum of such stages, i.e., (1) seed stage, (2) startup stage, (3) other early stage, (4) expansion stage, (5) later/acquisition stage, and (6) other. We then assessed the extent to which the VCFs’ investments were concentrated in particular industries and stages by calculating a Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) across the above industry and stage categories. By calculating an HHI measure on the distribution of the VCFs’ investments across industries and stages, we estimated the degree to which the VCFs’ knowledge was concentrated (i.e., specialized) across different industry or stage categories. We calculated the Herfindahl index with the following formula:  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{HHI}}=\\sum p_{\\mathrm{i}}^{2}\n$$  \n\nwhere $p_{\\mathrm{i}}$ represents the proportion of investments made in a particular industry (or stage) category in a given year.  \n\nFurther, we measured the degree of syndication as the average number of coinvestors for the first-time investments made by a focal VCF in a given year. We preferred this approach to simply calculating the proportion of syndicated deals in a given year since the vast majority of first-time deals were indeed syndicated, thereby creating little variation in terms of whether syndication was used. Thus, the bulk of the variance in syndication behavior could be captured by the degree rather than by the existence of syndication.  \n\nControl Variables. We also included several control variables. First, to account for the possibility that less established PFCs were more likely to fail, we controlled for the (average) development stage and age of the PFCs, as well as the (average) number of the round at which the PFCs joined the focal VCF's portfolio. We used the six stage categories previously described, assigned to them values from 1 to 6 to reflect their increasing degree of development, and then calculated an average stage value for each VCF and each year. Similarly, we calculated the average PFC age and average round number of the first-time investment for each VCF and each year. These PFC characteristics also served as indicators of deal quality, thereby ensuring that the results could not be explained by the VCFs’ keeping good deals to themselves and syndicating only excessively risky deals. Second, to tease out the effect of VCFs’ overall, cumulative investment experience, we controlled for the age of the VCF. Third, in order to account for the fact that PFCs in some industries (e.g., computer related) were more likely to default, we controlled for the industries in which a VCF had invested in a given year. We used the nine industry categories previously outlined and calculated the proportion of first-time investments made in a given category in a given year. Finally, we controlled for the investment year in order to account for the possibilities (1) that investments made in a particular year may have faced more turbulent conditions (e.g., the frenzy of entrepreneurial and venture capital activity that occurred over the 1998-2000 period), and (2) that the investments made in more recent years (e.g., 2000, 2001) may have not had “enough\" time to fail.  \n\n### Analysis  \n\nSince our data structure represented repeated observations of the same units (200 VCFs) over a 12-year time period, we used panel data estimation techniques to test our hypotheses. An important advantage of panel data, compared with regular time series or cross-sectional data sets, is that it allows for the identification of certain parameters or questions that cannot be assessed with more traditional techniques. For instance, panel data are not only suitable to model or to explain why individual firms behave differently, but also to model why a given firm behaves differently at different time periods (e.g., because of different decisions made in the past) (Verbeek, 2000). In theory, our model included 2,400 (i.e., $200\\times12;$ firm-year combinations. However, the panel was unbalanced as not all VC firms were active in all years-some of them had ceased to invest by the time of our observation period (1990-2001), while others had been founded during the observation period and had thus made investments in only some of the years. There were a total of 1,038 firm-year combinations for which there were no investments made. This, together with other missing information on some of the independent variables, reduced the usable observations to 1,008.  \n\nIn running the estimation, we needed to determine whether a fixed or a random effect model would be more appropriate. Theoretically, this determination was driven by our expectation of whether the unobserved firm-specific effects were fixed or random, and whether they were correlated with our set of predictors. Statistically, a comparison of the two types of estimation is possible, with any systematic differences between the two suggesting that a fixed effects model is more appropriate. For this purpose, we ran a Hausman specification test, which entailed a comparison between the fixed and random effects estimation. The test revealed no systematic differences in the coefficients in the twoestimations $\\chi^{2}=16$ ; 25 degrees of freedom; $p>.91$ ). We therefore used a random effects estimation of the following form:  \n\n$$\nY_{\\mathrm{i,t}}=\\upalpha+\\upbeta X_{\\mathrm{i,t}}+C_{\\mathrm{i,t}}+T_{\\mathrm{t}}+e_{\\mathrm{i,t}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y_{\\mathrm{i,t}}$ denotes the proportion of defaults among the first-time investments made by firm i in year t, $X_{\\mathrm{i,t}}$ represents a vector of the investment strategy variables for firm i in year t hypothesized as influencing the proportion of defaults, $C_{\\mathrm{i,t}}$ represents a vector of control variables for firm i in year t, and $T_{\\mathrm{t}}$ represents a fixed effect for year t. Under this specification, all firm-specific effects are contained in the error term, $e_{\\mathrm{i,t}}$  \n\n## Results  \n\nThe descriptive statistics and correlations among the variables in the model are shown in Table 1. Table 2 shows the regression results: model 1 (the base) contains only the control variables, while models 2 and 3 add the hypothesized effects of specialized expertise and syndication. Given the high correlation (.66) between the industry and stage specialization variables, we entered these variables separately: industry specialization in model 2 and stage specialization in model 3. The base model is significant (Wald $\\chi^{2}=79.13$ ， $p<.001\\$ ). After adding the predictor variables, there is significant improvement in both model 2 (Wald $\\chi^{2}=88.\\bar{9}51$ $p<.001,$ ）and model 3 (Wald $\\chi^{2}=\\hat{9}2.72$ $p<.001\\$ ). Hypothesis 1 predicted a negative effect for specialized industry and stage expertise on the failure rate of the portfolio. The coefficient for stage specialization in model 3 was negative and significant $(\\mathbf{B}=-.026\\$ $p<.05,$ 0, providing support for hypothesis 1. In model 2, the effect of industry specialization on portfolio failure was negative and not significant · $\\mathrm{\\Delta}\\mathrm{\\phi}(\\mathrm{B}=-016\\$ $p<.12;$ , although it displayed a strong trend in the predicted direction.  \n\nFurther, hypotheses $_{2\\mathrm{a}-2\\mathrm{b}}$ provided competing explanations for the effect of syndication on portfolio failure. The coefficient for syndication was positive and significant in both models 2 and 3 $(\\beta=.004;p<.01)$ providing support for hypothesis 2b. Specifically, the more a VCF syndicates its first-time investments, the higher the proportion of defaults among these investments.  \n\n## Discussion  \n\nNew firms are vulnerable to failure given their lack of legitimacy in the business community and their lack of knowledge and resources (Stinchcombe, 1965; Stuart et al., 1999). Since new venture failure is an important aspect of economic reality, it is important to have a better understanding of the factors that affect the likelihood of such failure. In this study, we examined the likelihood of new venture failure from the perspective of one important stakeholder for entrepreneurial ventures, VCFs. More specifically, we hypothesized that VCFs' portfolio failure rate depends to some extent on the investment strategy pursued by the VCFs. We examined two aspects of such strategy—-the extent to which the VCF develops specialized expertise and the extent to which the VCF syndicates its investments. We found that the focal VCF's specialized stage expertise had a negative effect on the failure rate of its portfolio. We also found that the degree of syndication of the focal VCFs’ first-time investment positively—-rather than negatively—affected portfolio failure. Overall, our findings outline two main conceptual contributions. First, we demonstrated the importance of knowledge creation and utilization by VCFs for decreasing venture failure. Second, we illustrate the potentially detrimental effect of investment syndicates on venture survival resulting from reduced commitment and free riding on Others’(i.e., coinvestors') efforts.  \n\nIn addition, our study makes some methodological contributions to the literature on venture capital investing. First, we examined the effects of realized rather than intended VC investment strategies on the nature of investment outcomes. That is, our approach is different from previous research that assessed individuals’ perceptions in terms of the nature of VC investments (e.g., Gupta & Sapienza, 1992) or of the involvement in investment syndication (e.g., Lockett & Wright, 2001; Manigart, Lockett, Meuleman, Landstrom, & Desbrieres, 2002). Second, prior research on VCFs’ investment strategies has devoted most attention to how differences between VCFs rather than changes within  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>切</td><td>0. 0.</td></tr><tr><td>3 2</td><td>.04 -.11 -.07</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>-.04 -.10 90'-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>90'- 60'- -.03 60'- -.02</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-.16 -.22 -.30 -.10 -.26 -.19</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>-.26 -.05 -.15 -.21 90- -.17 -.11</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>00'- -.04 .04 -.02 0. 0. 0. 0</td></tr><tr><td>7 6</td><td>-.00 3. 0 3. 8. -.00 -.07 -.07</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>25. 0. 2.

In this study, however, we examined how incremental investment decisions affect the failure rate of new ventures over time. Our outcome measure reflected the proportion of defaults within a specific yearly lot of investments. It is thus a reflection of the relative effectiveness of the VCF's strategic investment decisions (in terms of expertise development and syndication) that were made in the past. Finally, while the literature on the role of VCFs in enhancing portfolio company survival has mostly examined the effects of the VC industry as a whole, typically comparing VC-backed with non-VC-backed firms (Baum & Silverman, 2004), we focused on identifying differences within VCFs and across time, thereby adding to a small body of literature that examines differences across VCFs (e.g., Dimov & Shepherd, 2005).  \n\nIn the remaining paragraphs, we give a more detailed discussion of our findings, and we also devote attention to the implications, limitations, and avenues for future research.  \n\n### Effect of Specialized Expertise  \n\nOur findings show that the likelihood of new venture failure is reduced when the venture is supported by a VCF that brings knowledge relevant to the specific situation of the venture. This specialized expertise diminishes the uncertainty that surrounds venture capital investments and allows the VCF to add substantial value to its portfolio companies (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992; Norton & Tenenbaum, 1993; Sapienza, 1992). However, when there is limited compatibility between the VCF's investment expertise and the specific context of a portfolio company, the VCF may fail to detect the venture's needs or potential challenges, or may simply apply its own expertise to the company's detriment. Furthermore, our results also indicate that specialized expertise may not only allow for more effective assistance from the VCF's point of view, but may also allow for a higher receptivity by the venture to the VCF's input (Busenitz, Moesel, Fiet, & Barney, 1997). That is, when the venture is exposed to relevant advice from the VCF, the acquisition of this new information is enhanced because the venture can more readily recognize and use its value (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). Prior research has indeed suggested that overlap in terms of the specific backgrounds between two partners reduces failure because familiarity with the assumptions underlying external information facilitates the absorption of new knowledge (Lane & Lubatkin, 1998). As a result, new ventures that share characteristics with the VCF's prior investments are more likely to benefit from the VCF's advice, and therefore are less likely to fail.  \n\nIn short, we empirically showed that VCFs’ strategy of developing expertise in particular areas may be an effective tool for averting venture failure. Although we did not find a significant effect for industry specialization, we argue that, given its high correlation with stage specialization (.66) and the strong trend of the effect of industry specialization in the predicted direction, stage and industry specialization may go hand in hand. This is related to the possibility that companies in different industries may consider VC financing at different stages of development. Thus, if a VCF prefers a particular industry, it is likely that its deal fow includes more companies of a particular stage. This suggests that VCFs need to consider aspects related to both development stage and industry when developing expertise aimed at future investments.  \n\n### Effect of Syndication  \n\nA particularly interesting outcome of this study pertains to the positive effect of syndication on the proportion of defaults in the VCF's portfolio. That is, we examined the effect of a focal VCF's syndication of its first-time investments on the relative number of failures in its portfolio, and we found that syndication led to an increased likelihood of failure. This finding is contradictory to the generally held belief about the beneficial effects of syndication. For instance, it has been argued that the success of VC investments may increase when the VCF is able to exchange information with other coinvestors before an actual investment decision is made; i.e., syndication may help the investor find better investment targets than it would find on its own (Lerner, 1994). Furthermore, Brander et al. (2002) argued that syndication decreases the likelihood of failure because syndicate partners can bring complementary knowledge to the table.  \n\nHowever, our findings run counter to the notion that syndication is an important strategy for knowledge sharing and uncertainty reduction (Brander et al., 2002; Bygrave, 1987; Lerner, 1994), as applied to the context of averting failure. One explanation of this finding is that once a venture loses its promise of high (or even adequate) returns, it may be shut off from the expertise of the investment syndicate. Thus, it is rendered a “living dead’ status (Ruhnka et al., 1992). When such companies face failure, their \\*“living dead\"  \n\nstatus precludes obtaining timely help and thus accelerates the risk of default. In particular, we believe that when multiple VCFs are involved in financing the company, a continued commitment by any of them may be diminished (Birmingham et al., 2003), thereby precluding additional involvement through  value-added input or subsequent investments. This lower commitment may result from the VCFs’ feeling of lower responsibilityvis- $\\cdot\\grave{a}$ -vis a prior investment decision when this responsibility is shared with other investors (Staw, 1976). Ultimately, the VCFs may then opt for default as a more speedy option for retrieving at least some value from the company.  \n\nA related explanation for the positive effect of syndication on failure pertains to the group dynamics that take place within investment syndicates. More specifically, when confronted with ventures that are poorly performing, the focal VCF may be more likely to free ride on the coinvestors’ activities, i.e., to trade off its own effort with the potential effort undertaken by the others (Olson, 1965; Wagner, 1995). This behavior needs to be seen in the light of the limited time that venture capitalists have at their disposal (Gifford, 1997). Gifford explained that venture capitalists face a serious time allocation dilemma with regard to devoting attention to their portfolio companies, to raising new funds, and to locating and closing new investment deals. She argued that VCFs economize on allocating their effort across these activities in ways that are optimal for the VCF itself, but not necessarily optimal for the portfolio companies. Given that VCFs may devote as much time as possible to those deals that generate the majority of their returns (Sahlman, 1990; Sapienza et al., 1994), each of the VCFs in an investment syndicate may become more inclined to count on their coinvestors when faced with a portfolio company that is not meeting preset performance standards. As a result, the financial backers of such a company will reduce or even stop their effort vis-a-vis the company, and the likelihood of default will increase.  \n\n## Implications  \n\nFrom a practical point of view, our results suggest that VCFs’ investment strategies matter in terms of the outcomes of their investments. For instance, new ventures will be less likely to fail when the VCFs hold expertise that is particularly relevant to the context of their investments. The nature of the expertise that the VCF has developed over time, e.g., in terms of development stage, may be crucial to better understand the pitfalls associated with effectively managing entrepreneurial ventures. Therefore, VCFs should be selective by investing in portfolio companies to which they can provide relevant operating experience or good stage- or industry-specific input. Furthermore, from a learning perspective, VCFs may be better off in the long run when developing mechanisms that allow for effective knowledge accumulation that can be applied to future investments. This assimilation of skills allows the VCF to better understand the needs of its current and future portfolio companies.  \n\nOur results for the effect of specialized expertise also have implications for entrepreneurs looking for finance. That is, the choice of a venture capital investor may go beyond financial considerations, and CEOs need to be selective when choosing their potential investors. That is, new ventures ought to have a clear understanding about which specific competencies they are looking for within potential investment firms. These insights may be, in particular, important if help is expected in specific areas of expertise.  \n\nOur results for the role of syndication also have practical implications. While syndication may lead to positive investment outcomes because it gives a venture access to a broader range of relevant knowledge, our results indicate that syndication may also accelerate the risk of investment default. This suggests that entrepreneurs should be on the alert once negative performance signals start appearing. While a VCF may be motivated to build its ventures to become spectacular successes, it may be more reluctant to prevent looming failure, especially when other coinvestors are involved in the deal. More specifically, VCFs may reason that, given the excessive demands on their time, they can count on efforts of their coinvestors to turn around the performance of disappointing deals, and therefore can turn their attention to their success deals or to other tasks such as raising new funds and screening more deals (Gifford, 1997). Even if this behavior, from an individual investor's perspective, may appear logical in the short term, it may have longterm consequences in that such behavior may harm the reputation of the VCF in the investor community and may discourage future invitations to join interesting syndicate partnerships.  \n\n### Limitations and Future Research  \n\nThis study has some limitations that need to be taken into account when interpreting the results. First, our use of yearly aggregate data may have decreased our ability to assess important variation in the data. Future research should examine in more detail how a VCF develops expertise over time by examining its investment pattern on a company-bycompany basis. For instance, what type of ventures are best added to the portfolio in order to diminish failures?  \n\nSecond, although we have shown that increased syndication positively affects VCFs' portfolio failure rate, our crude measure of syndication only allowed us to explore its broader nature. One should therefore consider this when tallying our results with those of other studies showing more beneficial performance effects of VC syndication. Given this broader measure, we were not able to distinguish between different types of syndication partners (i.e., other independent VCs, corporate VCs, or captive VCs). For instance, it would be interesting to examine which type of coinvestors need to be attracted in order to reduce the likelihood of free riding occurring in investment syndicates. Future research could therefore determine whether the potential detrimental effect of syndication varies by the type of syndication partners. In addition, as we have not addressed all possible nuances to the syndication-performance relationship, future research could explore its possibly curvilinear nature as well as its possible moderators. Such a refined, more precise analysis would make a significant theoretical contribution to the literature.  \n\nThird, despite our detailed focus on the effect of a VCF's investment strategy on the likelihood of new venture failure, we have treated the VCF as a “black box. Future research should examine the relationship between various competencies that are present within the VCF's management team, the nature of the investment decisions that are taken, and the likelihood of default. A possible additional explanation of our findings may be that the proportion of defaults is also determined by the fit between investment decisions that are made and the specific capabilities that are present within the individual investment managers. This explanation also suggests a fruitful area for future research.  \n\nFinally, the ultimate success (i.e., the rate of return) of a VCF's portfolio is determined less by the number of defaulted companies than by the number of successful exits (Sahlman, 1990). Achieving such exits is thus a primary goal of a VCF. In this regard, preventing failure may only be a secondary consideration. This suggests that the results presented in this article may also be a derivative from the success-enhancing strategies of the VCF. Although the factors underlying portfolio success and failure have been shown to be distinct (Dimov & Shepherd, 2005), analyzing failure separately from success is a limitation of this article.  \n\n## Conclusion  \n\nThis study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature in general and to the literature on venture capital finance in particular by highlighting the unrecognized role that VCFs' investment strategies play in the survival of new ventures. We found that VCFs’ specialized expertise decreases the relative number of defaults in their portfolio. Further, we found that the level of syndication in VCFs investment deals positively—rather than negatively—affects the proportion of defaults. We hope that our study leads to deeper investigation of the antecedents of successful venture building.  \n\n## REFERENCES  \n\nAmit, R., Brander, J., & Zott, C. (1998).

Thus, this study focuses on the relationship between VC and the green innovation of environmentally friendly firms. The analysis combines traditional patent data with homogenous citation data to jointly examine the quantity and quality of VC-funded firms’ green innovation. Results suggest that VC support not only improves firms’ success rate of patent application but also increases the innovation “value\"represented by increased citation.The Chinese government has asked government VC (GvC) to be a long-term strategic investment for environmentally friendly firms. However, we found that GVC negatively affects green innovation, which may be caused by the risk aversion and adverse selection of the GVC manager. By comparing the roles of experienced foreign VC and fullsample VC, we confirmed that the investment skills of developed countries could enhance the quantity and quality of green innovation in China.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nGreen innovation, defined as innovation that benefits the environment and contributes to environmental sustainability, emerged as a vital strategy against increasing environmental deterioration (Triguero et al., 2013; Demirel and Parris, 2015; Beltran-Esteve and Picazo-Tadeo, 2015; Hegeman and Srheim, 2021). However, green innovation requires longterm strategic investment and a large amount of financial support (Zhang et al.,2015). Venture capital (VC) provides both money and resources without requiring a quick return on investment and can thus enhance the green innovation of high-tech companies (Hall and Lerner, 2010).  \n\nUnfortunately, studies that distinguish green innovation created by environmentally friendly firms from those by pollution-intensive types are lacking, and a biased result might be derived. Given that venture capitalists aim at profit-oriented and competitiveness-enhanced green innovation, only environmentally friendly firms can meet such goals by creating valuable green technology. However, as the innovation of polluting enterprises is restricted by strict environmental regulations (Horbach et al., 2012; You et al., 2019), it almost always fails to convert directly into returns (Gaddy et al., 2017). Therefore, focusing on the accurate relationship between VC and green innovation by reviewing the data of environmentally friendly firms is imperative.  \n\nGiven the difficulty in pricing double externalities of green innovation, its under-investment issue is usually complemented by government VC (GVC), which emphasizes positive technology and environmental spillovers (Meyskens and Carsrud, 2013; Mrkajic et al., 2017). Therefore, theoretically, green innovation should be inspired by GVC from financial aids and policy support. Nevertheless, Chinese GVC funds are normally supervised by the government, whose managers enjoy fixed remuneration and will be held accountable in case of loss or failure of a GVC project. Current studies have paid less attention on whether the natural risk aversion of government venture capitalists or their objectives of innovation and environmental protection gain the upper hand. The present study aims to test such complex relations of China.  \n\nAlthough green-tech innovation has emerged in Europe and their investors have accumulated rich skills and resources with the growth of start-ups (Que and Zhang, 2020), their capability to share their experience advantage in China without obstruction has not been fully expounded. Our study attempts to determine whether foreign VC (FVC) will provide new blood in Chinese green investment or be limited by the socialist market economy.  \n\nTraditional literature is accustomed to applying patent data representing the innovation ability of firms. However, Hall et al. (2005) indicated that simple patent counts are inherently limited in capturing heterogeneity from the distribution of innovations, which vary enormously in their technological and economic “values.” Citations reflect the level of recognition in the market of every individual patent and thus introduce a way to gauge the enormous heterogeneity in the importance of patents (Wadhwa et al., 2016). As the patent amount is directly proportional to the efficiency of invention (Guler and Guillen, 2010), how VC affects the innovative behavior of firms must be examined with patent counts and patent citations as indicators.  \n\nThis study attempts to shed more light on the following aspects. First, we try to investigate whether and how VC can affect green innovation by reviewing the data of environmentally friendly firms. Second, we analyze two influence mechanisms of GVC on green innovation and determine which effect works in China through estimation. Third, we examine whether the investment experience of FVC can strengthen the positive effect on green innovation.  \n\nWe raise a more accurate idea to determine the relationship of VC and green innovation. As the profitable target of vC, focusing on the green innovation of environmentally friendly firms can avoid estimation bias. The strong negative influence of GVC on green innovation is interpreted from the governance perspective due to the risk aversion of managers in China. We further verify whether the investment experience from developed countries can be transmitted to developing countries through FVC.  \n\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 introduces the methodology. Section 4 describes the data and descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents and discusses the main results of the econometric model. Lastly, Section 6 provides the conclusion.  \n\n## 2. Literature review  \n\nScholars believe in the promotion role of VC to green innovation, because they have found that venture capitalists are specialized to overcome problems of high uncertainty and information asymmetry through financing, managing, and active monitoring (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2001; Popov and Roosenboom, 2013). These activities provide effective help for the rapid commercialization of clean energy technologies (Popov and Roosenboom, 2012).  \n\nHowever, some results in the discussion on polluting industries are unexpected. Gaddy et al. (2017) indicated that some venture capitalists yielded low investment returns in the cleantech of materials and chemical and manufacturing sectors. These sectors are forced to practice green production and reduce emission through green innovation due to the significant regulatory pressures on firms to reduce pollution and the resultant cost burden (Brunnermeier and Cohen, 2003). Conversely, environmentally friendly firms create green innovation technology for the purpose of profit, which can ultimately bring substantial returns for investors. Unfortunately, such data reflecting the real relationship between VC and green innovation have not been taken seriously in the availableliterature.  \n\nThe literature found that green-related investment is mostly dominated by nonprofit government funds, given that the environmental and innovative effects of green innovations are difficult to capture in the short term. GVC is intended to seed clean industries and attract more followers rather than gain financial profits (Luukkonen et al., 2013), and it may be more willing to devote resources to risky exploratory activities and allow longer time horizons with a stronger orientation to invention (Bertoni and Tykvova, 2015). Although GVC can overcome funding gaps, studies such as Grilli and Murtinu (2012) claimed that it performs worse in supporting early-stage ventures. Particularly, Chinese GVC causes the green industry to lack efficiency because of its policy-reliant habit of producing unfavorable conditions, including unreasonable corporation governance structure and incentive mechanism (Chen et al., 2011). To date, no research has accurately judged which effect will dominate the Chinese market under such a contradiction.  \n\nGreen-related VC was fostered early in Europe (Criscuolo and Menon, 2015). Hence, as the forerunner, European investors share dependable and combat-tested skills in various aspects to developing firms (Luo et al., 2019). However when they invest across countries, Que and Zhang (2020) indicated that FVC-backed firms are less innovative than domestic VC ones. This difference is due to geographical distance and their less fine-grained understanding of local institutions (Dai et al., 2012). Herein, we hope to verify the result of such debate in developing countries, as represented by China.  \n\nVC triggers innovation efficiency and capability differently in terms of the capital effect and innovation ability-boosting effect. For one, financial aids ease the financing constraints, and more inventions may be implemented (Ni et al., 2014). The significant positive influence of VC on the number of patent applications was observed by Sun et al. (2020). For another, operation resource and management competence improve patent value (Lindsey, 2008). Thus, many researchers have illustrated that the patents of VC-backed companies are of better quality (Guo and Jiang, 2013; Bertoni and Tykvova, 2015; among others). We realized that two dimensions (quantity and quality) can measure innovation. In addition, patent counts are used to represent innovation quantity, which may cause estimation bias, citations are considered to define patent importance and overcome heterogeneity methodologically (Hall et al., 2005).  \n\n## 3. Methodology  \n\n### 3.1. Poisson model  \n\nThe number of either patent applications or patents cited is a discontinuous random integer greater than or equal to O, which conforms to nonnegative discrete random condition. Thus, a count model should be selected to estimate the parameters. We rely on standard Poisson model in reference to the empirical research (Popov and Roosenboom, 2012; Hall and Helmers, 2013; Criscuolo and Menon, 2015; Barrot, 2017; Lin, 2020). The number of green patents of firm i in year t conforms to the Poisson distribution, as shown as follows:  \n\n$$\nP r\\big(Y=P A T_{i,t}\\big)=\\frac{e x p(-\\mu_{i t})\\mu_{i t}^{(P A T_{i t})}}{P A T_{i t}!}.\n$$  \n\nDependent variables in this model embody the number of green patents granted (patent grant), green patent applications (patent application), and green patent citations (including citation, 3-year citation, and 5- year citation), as the majority of studies support the use of these as proxy variables to measure the ability of firm innovation and invention (Arqué-Castells, 2012; Bertoni et al., 2010; Pierrakis and Saridakis, 2017; Wen et al., 2018).  \n\nTo achieve the objectives of the study,we also take the total amount of VC received, the VC participated in by the government, and the VC participated in by foreign institutions as treatment variables (AlbortMorant et al., 2016).  \n\n### 3.2. Difference-in-Difference (DID) model  \n\nPrevious firm-level studies have always identified the influence of VC on patenting activity with various techniques or related variables (Hirukawa and Ueda, 2011). Some studies have only compared the differences in patenting activity before and after VC is involved (Lerner et al., 2011; Ughetto, 2010), whereas others have resorted to a comparison between VC-backed firms and suitable controls after VC investments (Chemmanur et al., 2011). However, unobservable investment decisions lead to failure in matching, and neglecting this will cause an upward bias in the results. Bertoni et al. (2010) considered different econometric models on panel data models to control the unobserved heterogeneity that may affect a firm's patenting behavior other than the presence of VC.  \n\nThe above research seems to explain the influence of VC on innovation activities, but even Bertoni et al. (2010) did not control for the probable systematic differences of patenting activities between VCfunded and non-VC-funded firms. Therefore, according to Arqué-Castells (2012), the DID method allows to estimate the differences in patenting activity between treated and controls after VC investments and then compares it with the differences before VC investments, thereby controlling for permanent differences in patenting activities to deliver an estimate causal effect that is closer to reality.  \n\nThe DID model assumes that the trend in patenting activity is the same for VC-funded and control firms over time (Angrist and Pischke, 2009). However, VC-funded firms are usually selected after intensive screening processes on the basis of firms’ superior performance, which may lead the trend in patenting activity to be possibly greater for VCfunded firms. To preserve the parallel trend assumption, we follow Arqué-Castells (2012) and attempt to control for confounders affecting VCs’investment decisions that are likely to be correlated with firms' patenting activity. The control variables include firms’ patent stock, size, age, and leverage. With all conditions and variables, the basic econometric model can be shown as follows:  \n\n$$\nx_{i,t}^{'}\\beta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\nu c f i r m_{i}+\\beta_{2}\\nu c_{i,t}+C o n t r o l s+\\varepsilon_{i,t},\n$$  \n\nwherevcfir $m_{i}$ is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 for firms that receive VC at any point in time, and $\\nu c_{i t}$ is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 for VC-funded firms since the moment of VC investments onwards. In this manner, vcfin $\\boldsymbol{m}_{i}$ will control for systematic differences in the number of patent applications between VC-funded and control firms, whereas $\\nu c_{i t}$ will only capture the differences that take place after VC investments.  \n\nSimilarly, to examine the effect of GVC and FVC, we use the following models:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{x_{i,t}^{'}\\beta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}g\\nu c f i r m_{i}+\\beta_{2}g\\nu c_{i,t}+C o n t r o l s+\\varepsilon_{i,t},}\\ &{x_{i,t}^{'}\\beta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}f\\nu c f i r m_{i}+\\beta_{2}f\\nu c_{i,t}+C o n t r o l s+\\varepsilon_{i,t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere gvcfi $\\mathbf{\\nabla}m_{i}$ (or fvcfirmi) is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 for firms that receive GVC (or FVC), and $g{\\nu}c_{i t}$ (or $f\\nu c_{i t})$ is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 for GVC-funded firms (or FVC-funded firms) since the moment of these VC investments onwards. gvcfir $m_{i}$ (or fvcfirmi) is used to control the systematic differences in the number of patents between GVC- or FVC-funded and control firms, whereas $g v c_{i t}\\left(\\mathrm{or}f\\nu c_{i t}\\right)$ will only capture the differences that take place after specific VC investments.  \n\n### 3.3. Control variables  \n\nIn addition to the main variables of interest, several control variables are also incorporated. These variables are a firm's patent stock, age, size, and leverage, which is in line with Bertoni et al. (2010) and Arqué- Castells (2012).  \n\n#### 3.3.1. Patent stock  \n\nPatent stock is used to control the fact that patenting is a cumulative process that builds on a firm's established technological base (Arqué- Castells, 2012). We also adopt results including patent grant stock, patent application stock, citation stock, 3-year citation stock, and 5-year citation stock. The patent stock for each given year is measured as the sum of successful patent applications filed during the preceding four years, taking the depreciation rate as $25\\%$ yearly.  \n\nTable 1 Definition of variables.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Name</td><td>Definition</td><td>Source</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Dependent variables</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant</td><td>The number of successfully granted patents filed by firm i at year t</td><td>Patsnap</td></tr><tr><td>Patent application</td><td>The number of patent applications filed by firm i atyeart</td><td>Patsnap</td></tr><tr><td>Citation</td><td>The number of granted patent citations filed by firm i at year t</td><td>Patsnap</td></tr><tr><td>3-year citation</td><td>Thenumberofgrantedpatentcitationswithin three years filed by firm i at year t</td><td>Patsnap</td></tr><tr><td>5-year citation</td><td>The number of granted patent citations within five years filed by firm i at year t</td><td>Patsnap</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Treatmentvariables</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>Dummyvariablestakingthevalueof1forVC funded firms that receiveVC atyear t</td><td>Zdatabase</td></tr><tr><td>gvc</td><td>Dummy variables taking the value of 1 for GVC- fundedfirms that receive GVC at year t</td><td>Zdatabase</td></tr><tr><td>fvc</td><td>Dummy variables taking the value of 1 for FVC- fundedfirmsthatreceiveFVC atyeart</td><td>Zdatabase</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Controls variables</td></tr><tr><td>vcfirm</td><td>Dummy variables taking the value of 1 for firms that receiveVC at any point</td><td>Zdatabase</td></tr><tr><td>gvcfirm</td><td>Dummyvariables taking thevalue of1forfirms thatreceive GVC at anypoint</td><td>Zdatabase</td></tr><tr><td>fvcfirm</td><td>Dummyvariablestakingthevalueof1forfirms that receive GVC at anypoint</td><td>Zdatabase</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant stock</td><td>Sum of successfully granted patents filed by firm i during the preceding four years,taking the</td><td>Patsnap</td></tr><tr><td>Patent application</td><td>depreciationrateas25% Sum of patent applications filed by firm i during</td><td>Patsnap</td></tr><tr><td>stock</td><td>the preceding four years, taking the depreciation rate as 25% Sum of granted patent citations filed by firm i</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Citation stock</td><td>during the preceding four years,taking the depreciationrateas25% Sum of granted patent citations within threeyears</td><td>Patsnap</td></tr><tr><td>3-year citation stock</td><td>filed by firm i during the preceding four years, takingthedepreciationrateas25% Sumofgrantedpatentcitationswithinfiveyears</td><td>Patsnap</td></tr><tr><td>5-year citation stock</td><td>filed byfirmi during the preceding four years,</td><td>Patsnap</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>taking the depreciation rate as 25% Logarithm of firm's asset</td><td>Wind</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>Firm's age</td><td>Wind</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>Ratiooffirm'stotaldebttoitstotalasset</td><td>Wind</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: GVC (or gvc) represents government venture capital, and FVC (or fvc) means foreign venture capital.  \n\n#### 3.3.2. Age  \n\nWe control for age to correctly identify the effect of VC on a firm's patenting activity. A bias might occur if VC-funded firms have more patents than non-VC-funded firms, but it is simply because VCs tend to invest in young firms, which are per se highly innovative (Huergo and Jaumandreu, 2004).  \n\n#### 3.3.3.Size  \n\nFirm size prevents the estimation error caused by a company's capital difference. Brouwer and Kleinknecht (1999) considered smaller firms to be likely weaker in terms of operation capital, but they might compensate this weakness by seeking patent protection more actively. However, the costs associated with filing patent applications are extremely high and not always affordable for small firms, which might increase the possibility of large companies to obtain patents (Cassiman and Veugelers, 2006).  \n\n#### 3.3.4. Leverage  \n\nLeverage is used to distinguish a spurious relation whereby VC is found to spur innovation; however, it goes to highly innovative firms  \n\nwith low debt-to-equity ratios (Arque-Castells, 2012). All explanations of the control variables are shown in Table 1.  \n\n## 4. Data  \n\nWe initially screen the environmentally friendly firms belonging to either the environmental protection industry or the new energy industry in China. According to criteria of the Wind database,2 the environmental protection industry includes environment and facility services, manufacturing of special equipment for environmental protection, manufacturing of special instruments and meters for environmental monitoring, and processing of metal and nonmetallic waste and debris. The new energy industry includes solar energy, lithium batteries, water utilities, power utilities, photovoltaic, new energy vehicles, biomass energy, and their corresponding equipment manufacturing sectors.  \n\nHowever, there might be a situation wherein new energy vehicle firms are defined as environmentally friendly firms, but the patents they obtain include the manufacturing technology of automobile parts, which makes it difficult to distinguish whether the relevant patents belong to green innovation. To focus on the influence of VC on green innovation of environmentally friendly firms, we need to exclude nongreen patents from our environmentally friendly firms’ sample. Therefore, we follow Cormier and Magnan (2015) and use the keywords low carbon, environmental, green, emission reduction, energy saving, clean, recycling, saving, sustainable, ecological, environmental protection, and environmental pollution for green patent screening. All the patents of environmentally friendly firms in the sample contain at least one of the keywords above. Those patents of environmentally friendly firms that meet the“green conditions\"are selected and considered as our research objects.  \n\nInnovation data are collected from the Patsnap database,3 data of VC come from Zdatabase,4 and the rest of the data are from the Wind database. The definitions of all variables are shown in Table 1.  \n\nCleantech start-ups increasingly attract corporate VC (Hegeman and Srheim, 2021). If we aim to study the influence of VC, we should pay attention on start-ups. Thus, we screen 10,259 firms listed on the National Equities Exchanges and Quotations (NEEQ) as of January 1, 2019 and obtain 149 environmental protection firms and 75 new energy firms, for a total of 224 environmentally friendly firms. To avoid the impact of the financial crisis and its subsequent influence (the year 2009), we intend to use annual data from 2010 to 2018. Eventually, 185 environmentally friendly firms, including 1063 effective firm-year observations, are obtained by eliminating samples of delisted or missing data companies. In comparison with studies using the three year before Initial Public Offering (IPO) as time span of sample, our data provide a larger and longer sample.  \n\nTable2 Descriptive statistics of variables.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>S.D.</td><td>Min</td><td>Max</td><td>Observations</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">VC-funded (treatment group)</td></tr><tr><td>vcfirm</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>0.2829</td><td>0.4510</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant</td><td>6.0244</td><td>10.1377</td><td>0</td><td>68</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Patent application</td><td>8.2780</td><td>12.9424</td><td>0</td><td>87</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Citation</td><td>4.1268</td><td>14.8221</td><td>0</td><td>166</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>3-year citation</td><td>3.2512</td><td>12.5524</td><td>0</td><td>150</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>5-year citation</td><td>3.5049</td><td>13.6937</td><td>0</td><td>165</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant stock</td><td>13.3611</td><td>18.0156</td><td>0</td><td>113.4625</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Patent application stock</td><td>16.1961</td><td>21.7005</td><td>0</td><td>126.3410</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Citation stock</td><td>16.3347</td><td>39.3344</td><td>0</td><td>426.4153</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>3-year citation stock</td><td>12.2284</td><td>31.5468</td><td>0</td><td>329.1478</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>5-year citation stock</td><td>13.8794</td><td>35.4319</td><td>0</td><td>379.8863</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>9.0561</td><td>4.9208</td><td>1</td><td>23</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>9.7294</td><td>1.3503</td><td>4.6186</td><td>13.2858</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>47.2912</td><td>19.8275</td><td>3.6492</td><td>108.8031</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Controls (controlled group)</td></tr><tr><td>vcfirm</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant</td><td>0.4655</td><td>3.4250</td><td>0</td><td>48</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>Patent application</td><td>0.6646</td><td>4.8829</td><td>0</td><td>82</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>Citation</td><td>0.2741</td><td>2.7709</td><td>0</td><td>44</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>3-year citation</td><td>0.2466</td><td>2.5863</td><td>0</td><td>41</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>5-year citation</td><td>0.2496</td><td>2.6301</td><td>0</td><td>42</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant stock</td><td>0.8016</td><td>4.7265</td><td>0</td><td>67.9222</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>Patent application stock</td><td>1.0054</td><td>6.4387</td><td>0</td><td>93.6689</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>Citation stock</td><td>0.7601</td><td>4.4433</td><td>0</td><td>48.2226</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>3-year citation stock</td><td>0.6652</td><td>4.0021</td><td>0</td><td>43.0195</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>5-year citation stock</td><td>0.6858</td><td>4.0877</td><td>0</td><td>45.0351</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>9.4579</td><td>5.0531</td><td>1</td><td>25</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>8.9719</td><td>1.2086</td><td>4.9001</td><td>12.4112</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>44.0594</td><td>21.3113</td><td>3.5038</td><td>191.1930</td><td>653</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: All values are rounded off to four decimal places. The dummy value of the VC-funded group is 1, including 410 observations. The dummy value of the Controls group is 0, containing 653 observations.  \n\nTable 2 provides standard descriptive statistics for all the VC-funded firms and controls, and the differences are remarkable for the innovation-related variables. Clearly, the VC-funded firms applied more (the mean of VC-funded firms is over 8, whereas that of non-VC-funded firms is only 0.6), authorized more (over 6 for VC-funded group but only 0.4655 for controls),cited more (4.1268 vs. 0.2741 for citation, and similarly regarding other variables), and have a larger patent stock (taking patent grant stock as an example, the mean of VC-funded firms is 13.3611, whereas another group is 0.8016—a trend consistent in other similar variables). Other statistics imply the same conclusion, especially in the maximum of citation stock emphasized (VC-funded firms valued at 426.4153 vs. controls at 48.2226). However, gaps for the remaining variables are literally small. vC-funded firms are older and have larger gearing ratios but are smaller on average.  \n\nTo prepare for exploring the heterogeneous effects of different types of VC, the descriptive statistics of GVC- and FVC-funded firms are also compared in Table 3. GVC-funded firms perform better on innovation, with more grants (the mean of GVC-funded firms is 8.4916 but only half for control groups), citations (6.4190 vs. 2.3506), and patent/citation stock. The situation of FVC-funded firms is remarkably similar, and all other statistics support the above conclusion. In addition, GVC- and FVCfunded firms are larger in firm size. However, GVC investors are more likely to subsidize younger firms, because the average age of GVCfunded firms is slightly longer than that of the controls group (8.1117 vs. 9.7879); conversely, the situation of FVC is the opposite, with the average age of 10.2405 for FVC-funded firms but 8.7734 for control group. Moreover, FVC has funded fewer firms (only 79 out of 410 samples), because of the investment restrictions of foreign firms in China (Guo and Jiang, 2013).  \n\nTable3 Descriptive statistics of GVC-funded and FVC-funded firms.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>S.D.</td><td>Min</td><td>Max</td><td>Observations</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">PanelA:GVC-funded firmsvs.Controlfirms</td></tr><tr><td>GVC-funded</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>gvcfirm</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>gvc</td><td>0.1955</td><td>0.3977</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant</td><td>8.4916</td><td>13.4266</td><td>0</td><td>68</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>Citation</td><td>6.4190</td><td>20.8983</td><td>0</td><td>166</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant</td><td>19.1001</td><td>24.3719</td><td>0</td><td>113.4625</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>stock</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Citation stock</td><td>26.3133</td><td>56.5903</td><td>0</td><td>426.4153</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>10.0185</td><td>1.5004</td><td>4.6186</td><td>13.2858</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>8.1117</td><td>4.3998</td><td>1</td><td>19</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>49.9935</td><td>19.9699</td><td>3.9673</td><td>108.8031</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>gvcfirm</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>gvc</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant</td><td>4.1126</td><td>5.9018</td><td>0</td><td>32</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>Citation</td><td>2.3506</td><td>6.7394</td><td>0</td><td>57</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant</td><td>8.9140</td><td>8.4830</td><td>0</td><td>39.7739</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>stock</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Citation stock</td><td>8.6024</td><td>11.6340</td><td>0</td><td>67.8285</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>9.5054</td><td>1.1767</td><td>6.0508</td><td>12.1275</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>9.7879</td><td>5.1813</td><td>1</td><td>23</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>45.1973</td><td>19.5030</td><td>3.6492</td><td>97.8156</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\">Panel B:FVC-funded firms vs.Controlfirms</td></tr><tr><td>FVC-funded fvcfirm</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>fvc</td><td>0.1392</td><td>0.3484</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant</td><td>6.9747</td><td>11.4947</td><td>0</td><td>61</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Citation</td><td>7.1899</td><td>25.2805</td><td>0</td><td>166</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant</td><td>17.4168</td><td>21.5859</td><td>0</td><td>102.0006</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>stock</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Citation stock</td><td>35.0779</td><td>75.8937</td><td>0</td><td>426.4153</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>10.3971</td><td>1.1789</td><td>7.6045</td><td>13.2858</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>10.2405</td><td>4.1176</td><td>1</td><td>19</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>41.6372</td><td>16.0651</td><td>9.1710</td><td>79.9340</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Controls</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>fvcfirm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>fvc</td><td>0 0</td><td>0</td><td>0 0</td><td>0</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>5.7976</td><td>0</td><td></td><td></td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant</td><td></td><td>9.7917</td><td>0</td><td>68</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Citation</td><td>3.3958</td><td>10.8833</td><td>0</td><td>123</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant stock</td><td>12.3932</td><td>16.9484</td><td>0</td><td>113.4625</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>Citation stock</td><td>11.8612</td><td>21.2600</td><td>0</td><td>157.9932</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>9.5701</td><td>1.3414</td><td>4.6186</td><td>12.5853</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>8.7734</td><td>5.0584</td><td>1</td><td>23</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>48.6407</td><td>20.4147</td><td>3.6492</td><td>108.8031</td><td>331</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: All values are rounded off to four decimal places.

A total of 1063 observations are divided into 80 VC-funded samples and a control group of 105 firms.  \n\nIn Table 5, Columns (1)-(3) present the results of using patent grant as the dependent variable, without control variables and year dummies, with control variables but without year dummies, and with control variables and year dummies, respectively. The coefficient of vc is 0.0746 significant atthe $10\\%$ level in Model (1). Columns (4)-(6) of Table 5 use patent application as the dependent variable, and their coefficients are negative. This result indicates that VC support improves the success rate of patent application. As shown in Table 5, when the patent application decreased, the patent grant did not reduce concurrently.  \n\nClearly, the coefficients of vcfirm are significantly positive at the $1\\%$ level in all models, confirming Gu and Qian (2019) statement that venture-funded firms have a higher number of patent applications if these were obtained even before the venture capitalists’ investment, because the enterprises selected for VC may initially have a strong innovation ability. For control variables, patent grant stock and size have marked positive influence in all models, illustrating more technology stock and asset of enterprises to facilitate the creation of innovation. However, age and leverage have significant negative effects, as start-ups with more debts share more innovation enthusiasm to signal their value to potential investors (Zhang et al., 2019).  \n\nPrevious literature failed to come to a consistent conclusion on account of the patent application variable being used to support a positive effect (Sun et al.,2020). However, Caselli et al. (2009) claimed the negative relationship with registered patent data. We supplement related research by comparing the estimation of two variables together; thus, we deliver a more precise result that VC contributes to improving the approval rate of innovations.  \n\nSimilarly, we select patent citation as a proxy variable to measure innovation quality. Eq. (1) is estimated following Acosta et al. (2009) in Models (1)-(3) of Table 6. Given that patent citations are suggested to address the heterogeneity of skewed distribution (Hall et al., 2005), we use the 3-year citation and 5-yearcitation to replacethe dependent variable respectively in Columns (4)-(7). Table 6 shows that all coefficients of vc are significantly positive, illustrating that VC adds the “\"value” of green innovation by increasing the citations of funded firms. The coefficients of vcfirm are also significantly positive under the $1\\%$ level, implying that VC-funded firms has higher innovation ability. Other control variables have similar effects as presented in Table 5.  \n\nThis positive effect of VC on patent citation can be explained from three aspects. First, taking advantage of external resources is easier, which is a challenge without the endorsement of the VC investor due to the quality certification effect of VC investments (Hsu, 2006; Lindsey, 2008). Thus, the expected returns to R&D input are greater for those VCfunded firms, again spurring high-caliber innovations (Bertoni et al., 2010). Second, the coaching effect reflects that VC provides these firms with valuable advisory services in areas where these firms typically lack management capabilities (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2004; Large and Muegge, 2008). This condition is crucial for scientific orientation firms whose founders are competent in technique, such as new energy technology entrepreneurial companies (Bertoni et al., 2010; Guo and Jiang, 2013). Advanced managerial experiences help environmentally friendly firms heighten the marketization rate of their patents. The final key point is the supervision effect. Venture capitalists not only actively monitor the behaviors of entrepreneurs (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2003) but also use stage financing to protect their investments from opportunistic behaviors and create powerful incentives. The strict discipline leads to greater innovation productivity, especially for these green projects with greater capital risks (Kaplan and Stromberg, 2004; Bertoni et al.,2010).  \n\nTable 6 Impact of VC on citation.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Dependent variable</td><td colspan=\"3\">Citation</td><td colspan=\"2\">3-year citation</td><td colspan=\"2\">5-year citation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(2)</td></tr><tr><td>vcfirm</td><td>2.1055***</td><td>2.0045***</td><td>2.2073***</td><td>2.0112***</td><td>1.8979***</td><td>2.0377***</td><td>1.9318***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(25.1666) 0.5454***</td><td>(23.7116) 0.2726***</td><td>(25.4800) 0.1212**</td><td>(22.5441) 0.4407***</td><td>(21.0290) 0.1637**</td><td>(23.0625) 0.5178***</td><td>(21.6279) 0.2371***</td></tr><tr><td>Vc</td><td>(10.0344)</td><td>(4.8900)</td><td>(2.0778)</td><td></td><td>(2.5437)</td><td>(8.6264)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0.0109***</td><td>0.0076***</td><td>(7.0245)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(3.8538)</td></tr><tr><td>Citation stock</td><td>0.0105***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(62.3763)</td><td>(52.5443)</td><td>(31.8765)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3-year citation stock</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0132***</td><td>0.0139***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(56.1236)</td><td>(47.5621)</td><td>0.0118***</td><td>0.0124***</td></tr><tr><td>5-year citation stock</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(50.5215)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(59.3275)</td><td>0.1749***</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td></td><td>0.1765***</td><td>0.3419***</td><td></td><td>0.1820***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(9.0115) -0.1310***</td><td>(15.8472)</td><td></td><td>(8.2958)</td><td></td><td>(8.2399) -0.1402***</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td></td><td>(-19.5226)</td><td>-0.0766***</td><td></td><td>-0.1404***</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>-0.0066***</td><td>(13.1496)</td><td></td><td>(-18.2638) -0.0041***</td><td></td><td>(-18.9759) -0.0055***</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td></td><td>(5.2631)</td><td>-0.0125***</td><td></td><td>(2.9837)</td><td></td><td>(-4.1304)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-1.3034***</td><td>-1.5304***</td><td>(-8.5787) -1.4209***</td><td>-1.4105***</td><td>-1.7320***</td><td>-1.3972***</td><td>-1.5927***</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td></td><td>(-8.9267)</td><td>(7.4461)</td><td>(17.8973)</td><td>(9.1430)</td><td>(-17.8382)</td><td>(8.7119)</td></tr><tr><td>Year dummies</td><td>(17.4383)</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>No 1063</td><td>1063</td><td>1063</td><td>1063</td><td>1063</td><td>1063</td><td>1063</td></tr><tr><td>VC-funded firms</td><td></td><td>80</td><td>80</td><td>80</td><td>80</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Control firms</td><td>80</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>105</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Pseudo R2</td><td>105 0.3917</td><td>105 0.4309</td><td>105 0.6210</td><td>105 0.3701</td><td>0.4114</td><td>105 0.3802</td><td>105 0.4216</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Model (1) is estimated by xi, $\\mathrm{\\Lambda}_{t}^{\\prime}\\beta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\nu c f i r m_{i}+\\beta_{2}\\nu c_{i,\\mathrm{\\Lambda}t}-$ +β6PATSTOCKi, $\\mathbf{\\sigma}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_{t_{}}$ without year dummies; Model (2) is estimated by x, $\\mathbf{\\chi}_{t}^{\\prime}\\beta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\nu c f i r m_{i}+$ $\\beta_{2}\\nu c_{i,t}+\\beta_{3}S i z e_{i,t}+\\beta_{4}A g e_{i,t}+\\beta_{5}L e\\nu_{i,t}+\\beta_{6}P A T S T O C K_{i,t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},$ without year dummies.

The dependent variable of Models (6)-(7) are 5-year citations.  \n\nGiven the advantage that citation data express the technicality and practicality values of an innovation (Ketchen et al., 2007), our results extend the explanation of VC's promotion mechanism. Specifically, high-quality innovation represented by citation comes from VC's internal management of innovative enterprises rather than only its provision of funds for inventions.  \n\nIn this part, results in Table 5 prove that VC improves the success rate of patent application. The patent application has decreased, the patent grant does not change significantly, or an increasing trend is observed in Model (1). The result in Table 6 shows that VC has a great role in promoting the “value” of the innovation by a significant increase in the number of citations. In sum, VC has more influence on innovation quality by improving the success rate of patent application and the number of citations, instead of simply helping firms to increase the number of patent applications.  \n\n### 5.2. GVC and innovation  \n\nEq. (2) is estimated to test whether GVC can accelerate green innovation by choosing patent grant and citation as dependent variables separately in Models (1)-(3) and (4)-(6) of Table 7. The significant amountsofgvc $(-0.4260$ and - 0.3821) at the $1\\%$ level in Models (3) and (6) show that GVC-funded firms’ granted rate and “value\" of patent arerestricted.  \n\nThe negative effect is assumed to be due to the principal-agent problem. The first reason may be the fixed remuneration system implemented in China (Jaaskelainen et al., 2007), which indicates that even if the investment is profitable, the wage of GVC leaders will not increase accordingly. Given that the profit of green technology is usually limited at the seed stage but soars sharply when it matures (Randjelovic et al., 2010), this asymmetry between the annual salaries of executives reduces the enthusiasm for strict supervision and cost efficiency to push green innovation. The second reason may be that green-related capital is mostly dominated by government or state-owned enterprises,7 wherein managers might be punished for the loss of the investment in some extent. Thus, they tend to invest in mature or safer programs instead of start-up and cash-strapped eco-friendly ones to ensure their political status, which become industrialized at the end rather than develop more green innovations. The regular administrative intervention of GVC also causes difficulties in commercial operations (Zhang et al., 2015).  \n\nIn this part, we prove that the risk aversion effect of GVC is greater than the capital effect to Chinese green innovation. Moreover, several reasons are added to interpret the unsatisfactory productivity of GVC shown in previous studies, such as Alperovych et al. (2015) and Grilli and Murtinu (2012). In Table 7, significantly positive gvcfrim indicates that GVC investors also prefer creative firms, and the control variables show the similar results as VC.  \n\nTable 7 Impact of GVC on innovation.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Dependent variable</td><td colspan=\"3\">Patent grant</td><td colspan=\"3\">Citation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(9)</td></tr><tr><td>gvcfirm</td><td>0.3268***</td><td>0.2591***</td><td>0.2977***</td><td>0.6195***</td><td>0.3999***</td><td>0.5568***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(6.8448)</td><td>(5.3078)</td><td>(6.0339)</td><td>(10.6350)</td><td>(6.5655)</td><td>(8.5280)</td></tr><tr><td>gvc</td><td>-0.5009***</td><td>-0.5764***</td><td>-0.4260***</td><td>-0.8125***</td><td>-1.0380***</td><td>-0.3821***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(-6.5023)</td><td>(7.4542)</td><td>(-5.3634)</td><td>(-6.9919)</td><td>(-8.9073)</td><td>(3.1722)</td></tr><tr><td>Patent grant stock</td><td>0.0244***</td><td>0.0232***</td><td>0.0188***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(36.0222)</td><td>(26.6351)</td><td>(21.1397)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Citation stock</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0090***</td><td>0.0099***</td><td>0.0068***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(50.1168)</td><td>(45.3643)</td><td>(27.0813)</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td></td><td>0.1005***</td><td>0.1693***</td><td></td><td>0.1774***</td><td>0.2818***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(5.1820)</td><td>(8.3290)</td><td></td><td>(8.5901)</td><td>(12.3187)</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td></td><td>-0.0510***</td><td>-0.0320***</td><td></td><td>-0.1315***</td><td>-0.0573***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(-10.1448)</td><td>(-6.3755)</td><td></td><td>(-18.8068)</td><td>(-8.8792)</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td></td><td>-0.0059***</td><td>-0.0075***</td><td></td><td>-0.0128***</td><td>-0.0155***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(5.1133)</td><td>(-6.2011)</td><td></td><td>(-9.5708)</td><td>(-9.9005)</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>1.1730***</td><td>0.9549***</td><td>1.1432***</td><td>0.7718***</td><td>0.7495***</td><td>1.2930***</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(35.2493)</td><td>(5.3909)</td><td>(5.5003)</td><td>(17.9681)</td><td>(4.3324)</td><td>(6.5479)</td></tr><tr><td>Year dummies</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>GVC-funded firms</td><td>35</td><td>35</td><td>35</td><td>35</td><td>35</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Control firms</td><td>45</td><td>45</td><td>45</td><td>45</td><td>45</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Pseudo R2</td><td>0.2505</td><td>0.2709</td><td>0.3446</td><td>0.2905</td><td>0.3518</td><td>0.6314</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Model (1) is estimated by ${x_{i,t}}^{\\prime}\\beta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}g\\nu c f i r m_{i}+\\beta_{2}g\\nu c_{i,t}+\\beta_{6}P A T S T O C K_{i,t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},$ without year dummies; Model (2) is estimated by $x_{i,t}{'}\\beta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}g\\nu c f i r m_{i}+$ $\\beta_{2}g\\nu c_{i,t}+\\beta_{3}S i z e_{i,t}+\\beta_{4}A g e_{i,t}+\\beta_{5}L e\\nu_{i,t}+\\beta_{6}P A T S T O C K_{i,t-1}$ $\\mathbf{\\sigma}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{\\sigma}\\varepsilon_{i}$ $_{t;}$ without year dummies.

(3) is utilized to check whether FVC helps China's environmentally friendly firms obtain more patents. Table 8 shows the significant positive fvc with patent grant in Models (1)-(3) and citation data in Columns (4) and (5), indicating that FVC-backed firms have obtained more authorized and cited patents. Furthermore, the coefficient of vc is only 0.0746 in Column (1) of Table 5, which is less than 0.8325 of the fvc in Table 8 under the same estimate condition. The coefficients of vc are also considerably smaller than those of fvc (0.5454 and 0.2726 in Table 6 vs. 1.0828 and 0.4129 in Table 8). Thus, the entry of FVC in the Chinese market indeed promotes the patent activities of environmentally friendly firms. The reasons are as follows.  \n\nThe first is rich management experience and resources. As a successful international fund, FVC shares the tested hedging system, ready knowledge, and international opportunity for green projects (Hochberg et al., 2007). The innovation competitiveness of FVC-backed firms is undoubtedly strengthened. The second cause is less restrictions of FVC. In terms of risk, when most being-supervised Chinese VC may be prohibited from spending on risky fields such as green innovation (Guo and Jiang, 2013), FVC favors high-risk and high-yield projects. From the perspective of administration, the equitable “pay-for-performance\" compensation structure of FVC inspires more efficient innovation than the salary cap rule adopted in China. Third, FVC stimulates high-quality patents by introducing stock options for their R&D personnel (Tan et al., 2008).  \n\nThrough the positive influence of FVC on innovation, we verify that the experience of FVC in developed countries is also applicable in investing developing countries to promote innovation of start-ups (Luo et al., 2021). By comparing the coefficients of fvc and vc, our empirical results extend the conclusion of Liu et al. (2006) that FVC is better in promoting entrepreneurial firms.  \n\nThe significantly negative fvcfirm in Table 8 indicates that FVC will not specially pick enterprises with mature innovation. However, all control variables perform the same effects as those in above estimation results.  \n\n### 5.4. Robustness check  \n\nPatent grant variables may not fully reflect the innovation ability of enterprises during our research period, because the truncate problem caused by the average time from patent application to patent granted is 2.9 years in China.8 To further test the robustnes, we also take the number of patent application as a measurement index, whose data avoid time-delay problem. Moreover, in view of the practice that citation may not be accurately reflected in the patent granted year, the five-year period is considered.  \n\nIn Table 9, the effects of gvc and gvcfirm are significantly negative, confirming the negative effect of GVC on innovation, as shown in Table 7. Control variables also prove the robustness of the result.  \n\nThe above frame is also exhibited to determine the influence of FVC on innovation. Table 10 exhibits a significantly positive relationship between FVC and innovation, which is nearly consistent with that in Table 8. Thus far, the above tables ensure the reliability of all estimation results.  \n\n## 6. Conclusions and policy implications  \n\nThis study focuses on the practical efficiency of VC in green innovation by applying the data of previously unnoticed environmentally friendly firms. Green innovation from environmentally friendly firms is not only ecological but also profitable, which polluting-alleviated green innovation finds difficult to achieve. We proved that VC improves innovation efficiency with traditional patent quantity data from the fact that the number of patents granted will not decrease with the reduction of patent applications. Furthermore, we provided evidence that VC spurs innovation ability by considering patent citation data, thereby overcoming heterogeneity empirically and reflecting innovation  value theoretically.  \n\nTable10 Robustness check of the effect of FVC on innovation.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Dependent variable</td><td colspan=\"3\">Patent application</td><td colspan=\"3\">5-year citation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td><td>(5)</td><td>(6)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">fvcfirm</td><td>-0.0542</td><td>-0.0396</td><td>-0.0565</td><td>-0.4137***</td><td>-0.3907***</td><td>0.1995**</td></tr><tr><td>(-1.2126)</td><td>(-0.8434)</td><td>(-1.1967)</td><td>(4.4664)</td><td>(-4.1328)</td><td>(2.2141)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">fvc</td><td>0.7541***</td><td>0.5651***</td><td>0.4902***</td><td>1.0429***</td><td>0.3890***</td><td>0.0757</td></tr><tr><td>(8.4666)</td><td>(6.1755)</td><td>(5.3263)</td><td>(8.2376)</td><td>(3.0416)</td><td>(0.5786)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Patent application stock</td><td>0.0221***</td><td>0.0199***</td><td>0.0184***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(47.6474)</td><td>(31.2170)</td><td>(28.6575)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td><td></td><td>0.0122***</td><td>0.0130***</td><td>0.0083***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">5-year citation stock</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(40.5918)</td><td>(37.7277)</td><td>(23.9203)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.1096***</td><td>0.1484***</td><td></td><td>0.1898***</td><td>0.3309***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Size</td><td></td><td>(6.4942)</td><td>(8.4746)</td><td></td><td>(8.5259)</td><td>(13.0337)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.0364***</td><td>-0.0244***</td><td></td><td>-0.1352***</td><td>-0.0749***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Age</td><td></td><td>(-8.5596)</td><td>(-5.7666)</td><td></td><td>(17.4694)</td><td>(11.1648)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-0.0047***</td><td>-0.0054***</td><td></td><td>-0.0120***</td><td>-0.0137***</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Leverage</td><td></td><td>(4.6797)</td><td>(-5.1055)</td><td></td><td>(-7.8319)</td><td>(7.5241)</td></tr><tr><td>1.5642***</td><td>1.0697***</td><td>1.3381***</td><td>0.8482***</td><td>0.5934***</td><td>0.9232***</td></tr><tr><td>constant</td><td>(62.7951)</td><td>(6.9937)</td><td>(7.1578)</td><td>(25.1317)</td><td>(3.1135)</td><td>(4.2122)</td></tr><tr><td>Year dummies</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>GVC-funded firms</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Control firms</td><td>64</td><td>64</td><td>64</td><td>64</td><td>64</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Pseudo R2</td><td>0.2488</td><td>0.2628</td><td>0.3111</td><td>0.2844</td><td>0.3407</td><td>0.6365</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNote: Model (1) is estimated by ${x_{i,t}}^{\\prime}\\beta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}g\\nu c f i r m_{i}+\\beta_{2}g\\nu c_{i,t}+\\beta_{6}P A T S T O C K_{i,t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i,t},$ without year dummies; Model 2) is estimated by $x_{i,t}{'}\\beta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}g\\nu c f i r m_{i}+$ $\\beta_{2}g y c_{i,t}+\\beta_{3}S i z e_{i,t}+\\beta_{4}A g e_{i,t}+\\beta_{5}L e\\nu_{i,t}+\\beta_{6}P A T S T O C K_{i,t-1}+$ $_{t;}$ without year dummies.

Although it can provide funds for start-ups, the risk aversion reaction of regulated leaders leads to the negative influence of innovation on GVC's intervention.  \n\nWe also verified a controversial issue regarding whether green investment experience originated and expanded in Europe produces a marked effect in China. Our results indicated that FVC has a greater positive effect on innovation.  \n\nOur study contributes significantly to policy implications in the developing VC industry and innovation Chinese market. For the future strategy of VC, GVC and independent VC should learn more from FVC. Providing funds is only a basic purpose; resource sharing and efficient supervising are also secrets to boosting innovation. Moreover, venture capitalists should be aware of the green innovation's double spillover effects in innovation and environment to emphasize long-term payback.  \n\n# Acknowledgements  \n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 71704186, 71603021, and 71521002); and Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education (grant number 16JDYJC014).  \n\n# Appendix A.

Executive Summary  \n\nOver the past decade, billions of dollars have been invested by established companies in entrepreneurial ventures, yet there is little systematic evidence that such investmentoften referred to as Corporate Venture Capital (CVC)-creates value to investing firms. Established firms may be well positioned to gain direct financial benefits from CVC due to privileged knowledge in selecting valuable ventures and the possession of complementary assets that enhance the value of their portfolio companies. In addition, CVC may offer a valuable window on technology, as it provides an effective means of scanning the environment for novel technologies that either threaten or complement core businesses. Such benefits, however, may be diminished due to internal conflicts, lack of incentives for fund managers, and rampant information asymmetries leading to potential adverse selection.  \n\nAnalyzing a panel of U.S. public firms during 1990s, we find that corporate venture capital is associated with the creation of firm value-measured as firm's Tobin's $q$ -butthat this relationship is conditional on both sector-specific and firm-specific factors. In particular, the positive relationship between CVC and firm value creation is greatest within the devices, semiconductor, and computer sectors. Moreover, the contribution of corporate venture capital investment to firm value is greater when firms explicitly pursue CVC to harness entrepreneurial inventions. Thus, variance in CVC performance may be best explained by differences in the underlying objectives of the programs. We conclude that in those industries where entrepreneurial ventures are an important source of innovations, corporate venture capital can be a vital part of a firm's innovation toolkit.  \n\n## 2. Introduction  \n\nThe history of corporate venture capital (CVC), i.e., equity investments by established corporations in entrepreneurial ventures, has been marked by periods of rapid growth and decline.2 At the turn of the 21st century, a new wave of CVC activity occurred—-the third such wave since CVC first appeared as an investment vehicle for firms in the 1960s. In 2000, more than 400 manufacturing and service firms invested close to $\\$16$ billion in entrepreneurial ventures—approximately $15\\%$ of all venture capital investments (Venture Economics, 2001). In 2001, investment activity dropped precipitously as the market for new public offerings dried up. Many firms who had established funds only a few years earlier shut down their investment operations. In recent years, aggregate CVC investment has begun to pick up and remains well above historical levels (see Fig. 1).  \n\nScholars have speculated that the dramatic cyclical nature of corporate venture capital is indicative of underlying structural deficiencies. For one, firms may be disadvantaged in reducing information asymmetries due to ventures’ fears of expropriation by established firms. Corporate venture capital programs may not provide the same high power incentives to fund managers as independent venture capital funds, leaving funds in either less motivated or less capable hands (Block and Ornati, 1987; Chesbrough, 2000). Corporate CVC funds may be harmed by internal politics as business units compete over scarce resources (Sykes, 1986). When CVC funds do not produce substantial, immediate returns, top management may be quick to abolish funds and exit the venture capital market.  \n\n![](images/a213c79293adafffd465ae4b41afcb760b9b014ab43cd9bba2bdf7330975c447.jpg)  \nFig. 1. Total dollar volume of rounds by year.  \n\nEmpirical work paints a mixed picture. Gompers and Lerner (1998) found that the performance of ventures with corporate backers is as successful as independent VCs when there were similarities between the investing firm's and venture's lines of business. Block and MacMillan (1993) and Chesbrough (2000) provide evidence that corporate investors supply valuable complementary non-pecuniary resources and capabilities to the ventures they invest in. Others report that CVC-backed ventures received higher valuations at IPO compared to ventures funded solely by traditional VCs (Ginsberg et al., 2003; Maula and Murray,2001).  \n\nHowever, the financial benefits to the firms who invest corporate venture capital have been found to vary widely across CVC programs (Sykes, 1986; Block and Ornati, 1987; Siegel et al., 1988; Block and MacMillan, 1993; Gompers and Lerner, 1998; Chesbrough, 2000). Gompers and Lerner (1998) verify that CVC investment is more volatile than the general venture capital market. The average life span of a CVC fund is far shorter than that of independent venture capital funds. Furthermore, they found that corporate investors pay a premium to secure equity stakes in entrepreneurial ventures relative to traditional VCs, which may result in lower returns to the investing corporations.  \n\nWe propose that variance in CVC performance can be explained, in part, by differences in the orientation of CVC funds. Some firms seek not only direct financial returns on investment but indirect strategic benefits as well. These strategic benefits may offset poor financial returns and justify corporate venture capital investment. In particular, some firms invest in new ventures to provide a window on new technologies and practices. Exposure to new ventures may help investors innovate themselves or procure promising technologies through licensing or acquisition. Also, supporting new ventures that develop complementary product and services may further increase the demand for current and future corporate products. CVC programs with a strategic orientation typically adopt practices and routines that facilitate coordination as well as the transfer of knowledge between the venture and the investing firm.  \n\nIn this paper, we extend beyond the existing literature by looking at the overall benefits to CVC investment and not just the narrow financial returns to the investment. We study the conditions under which CVC investment creates value for investing firms. To capture firm value creation, we adopt Tobin's $q$ the market valuation of a firm over the value of firm tangible assets. By looking at value creation, we capture both the narrow financial returns to CVC investment and the strategic benefits. We build a robust data set and perform multiple tests to explore whether CVC investment impacts firm valuation and whether this relationship is driven primarily by financial or strategic CVC orientation.  \n\nWe present evidence that corporate venture capital investment is associated with the creation of firm value, but that this relationship is conditional on both temporal and sectoral factors. In particular, the positive relationship between CVC and firm value is greatest within the devices and information sectors. We find that this heterogeneous CVC performance may be best explained by differences in the underlying objectives of the funds. We find that the marginal contribution to firm value is greater when firms explicitly pursue CVC as a window on technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide large-sample evidence of the creation of firm value through corporate venture capital activity.  \n\n## 3. Theory review  \n\nScholars have been cautious in their assessment of the benefits of investing corporate venture capital. By leveraging their industry and technology expertise as well as their complementary assets, established firms can gain direct financial benefits through superior selection of valuable ventures and enhancement of their portfolio companies’ value. However, internal conflicts, weak incentives and rampant information asymmetries may erode these direct benefits. We argue that-if a firm assumes a strategic orientation to its CVC program-CVC investment may yield indirect benefits that compensate for the structural deficiencies. Corporate venture capital may enhance a firm's value by offering an effective means of scanning the environment for novel technologies that either threaten or complement core businesses. Therefore, we conjecture that corporate venture capital investment will create greater firm value when firms harness novel technology, rather than passively seek financial returns.  \n\nEstablished firms are well positioned to reap lucrative financial returns. First, they may be skilled in selecting valuable ventures. Firms often have expert personnel who possess in-depth knowledge of markets and technology. Larger firms may experience economies of scale and scope in managerial effort that allows them to perform superior due-diligence at lower cost. Second, corporate investors may be better positioned to provide complementary capabilities and resources to new ventures (Gompers and Lerner, 1998). Such support may increase the likelihood of venture success and ultimately lead to higher financial returns to the investing firm. Investing firms may provide valuable assets such as manufacturing capability, bargaining power with suppliers, and access to distribution networks (Teece, 1986). Investing firms may also provide access to valuable social and professional networks and an endorsement on the future viability of the venture (Stuart et al., 1999; Maula and Murray, 2001).  \n\nHowever, there are reasons to be skeptical of corporate venture capital as purely an investment vehicle. CVC investors often suffer from rampant information asymmetries. Entrepreneurial ventures have private information about their future prospects that are often not directly observable by potential investors (Gans and Stern, 2003). This may lead to adverse selection as low-quality ventures portray themselves as good investments. The problem is particularly pronounced for CVC investments since high quality ventures are hesitant to share information about their key technology with established firms for fear that those firms may expropriate their innovations (Dushnitsky, 2004). Moreover, entrepreneurs wary of corporate involvement may make it difficult for investing firms to monitor their portfolio companies. Lack of experience with a portfolio company's markets or technology may alleviate venture's expropriations concerns but may result in negligible corporate support (Sykes, 1986).  \n\nIn addition to conflicts between the CVC investor and entrepreneurs, there may be internal conflicts within the investing corporation. In order to maintain pay uniformity and to avoid inter-departmental jealousy, firms typically do not compensate their fund managers in the same way as independent venture capitalists (Block and Ornati, 1987; Birkinshaw et al., 2002). In particular, CVC fund managers typically receive a larger portion of their compensation in fixed salary than independent VC fund managers. As a result, CVC fund managers often do not have the same high powered incentives. In some cases, high quality fund managers have left CVC units for independent VCs, leaving the CVC fund in less capable hands (Block and Ornati, 1987). Compounding this problem is that corporate investments may be subject to capture by individuals in the organization with ulterior motives that may run counter to CVC fund performance. Top executives may wish to invest in new ventures simply to increase the scope of the firm. Finally, CVC funds may be harmed by internal politics as business units compete over scarce resources (Sykes, 1986).  \n\nDespite these structural deficiencies inherent in CVC programs, Gompers and Lerner (1998), among others, propose that any potential loss may be offset by indirect benefits investors receive. To distinguish these indirect payoffs from the direct financial return on investment, we refer to them as “strategic benefits\". Perhaps the most important strategic benefit is that CVC may provide a valuable window on technology. Corporate venture capital may provide an effective means of scanning the environment for novel technologies that either threaten or complement core businesses. Such scanning may provide critical knowledge about potential competitors and help identify future alliance partners and acquisition targets. A recent survey of global CVC programs finds that $67\\%$ of firms invest in new ventures for strategic reasons (Ernst and Young, 2002). Additional survey results (Siegel et al., 1988; Block and MacMillan, 1993; Yost and Devlin, 1993), case studies (Chesbrough, 2000; Henderson and Leleux, 2002) and practitioner accounts (Sykes, 1986; Winters and Murfin, 1988) support the claim that firms often pursue CVC as much for indirect strategic benefits as for direct financial return on investment.  \n\nMost importantly, CVC investment may provide important innovative benefits to firms. Strategically driven CVC programs employ various mechanisms to increase the stock of entrepreneurial knowledge they gain access to. Corporate investors often secure board seats, or at least board observation rights, which provide them with knowledge of ventures' key activities and technologies (Maula and Murray, 2001; Bottazzi et al., 2004). Firms also institute specific organizational routines to encourage and funnel learning through increased interaction and information flows (Arrow, 1974; Daft and Lengel, 1986). For example, in addition to securing board seats to its CVC group-Sony Strategic Venture Investments-Sony's business divisions establishes liaisons with its portfolio companies (International Business Forum, 2001). Indeed, recent research provides empirical evidence that, in some sectors, firms who invest CVC realize significant increases in their internal innovation rates (Dushnitsky and Lenox, 2005a,b). Even the outright failure of the venture may not be a bad outcome if the strategic benefits outweighed the initial investment. Such strategic benefits may accrue to the investing firm when technologies remain viable after the originating venture has dissolved (Hoetker and Agarwal, 2004) and failure itself carries informational weight (McGrath, 1999).3  \n\nAmong the potential strategic benefits of investing in new ventures is that a firm may be able to build demand for its technologies by helping develop ventures that provide complementary products and services (Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996). For example, Intel  spends substantial resources to explicitly  encourage  external  development of technologies and services that use its microprocessors (Gawer and Cusumano, 2o01). Such complementarities are common in the presence of demand externalities (Katz and Shapiro, 1994). Consistent with this, Dushnitsky (2004) finds that the likelihood of an investment in an innovative venture increases with the level of complementarity between the firm and the venture.4  \n\nIn sum, we expect firms that adopt a strategic orientation to experience greater value creation than firms that adopt a purely financial orientation. Firms are explicit in their CVC investment objective in their actions if not their words. As outlined above, firms who are engaged in CVC for strategic reasons put in place a series of structures which allow them to interact with and learn from the ventures they fund. This is not to say they are not concerned with the financial return on their investment, but simply that they receive additional value from the investment. Thus, we propose that the potential benefits of CVC when a firm assumes a strategic orientation will compensate for the structural deficiencies that plague CVC programs.  \n\nProposition. All else being equal, strategically focused CVC investment will create greater value than financially focused CVC investment.  \n\n## 4. Data and measures  \n\nTo explore the relationship between corporate venture capital investment objectives and firm value creation, we constructed a large panel of U.S. public firms during the period 1990-1999. Our sample contains information on firms’ venturing activity collected from Venture Economic's VentureXpert database and financial data from Standard and Poor's Compustat database. The VentureXpert database contains a comprehensive coverage of investment, exit, and performance activity in the private equity industry and provides us with the population of all private equity investments by established firms.  \n\nWe augmented these data with Compustat data on all U.S. public firms within the same industries as those firms in our CVC data set. Any results based only on a sample of CVC firms may cause gross misinterpretation. While the coefficient for CVC investment may reflect the contribution of CVC investments, it can also capture other factors such as macroeconomic upturns and industry-wide boosts in productivity. In order to address this concern, we include non-investors as a control group. An automated, matching algorithm and hand-checking were used to link the VentureXpert data with the Compustat data set. The resulting data set includes 1173 firms (8630 firm-year observations), where 171 of these firms invested corporate venture capital some time during the period 1990-1999.  \n\n### 4.1. Dependent variable  \n\nWe adopt Tobin's $q$ as our measure of firm value. Tobin's $q$ is the market valuation of a firm over the value of its tangible assets and is a good proxy for a firm's competitive advantage (Montgomery and Wernerfelt, 1988). A Tobin's $q$ greater than 1.0 indicates investors have a positive outlook for the firm's growth opportunities. The higher a firm's $q$ , the greater the growth opportunities for that firm. We use Tobin's $q$ as a measure of firm value rather than accounting-based measures (e.g., return on assets), because Tobin's $q$ reflects expected future earnings and captures the lag between CVC investment and realized benefits. In addition, Tobin's $q$ accounts for risk and is not as liable to reporting distortions as measures such as ROA (Lindenberg and Ross, 1981).  \n\nWe calculate Tobin's $q$ by dividing the sum of firm equity value, book value of longterm debt, and net current liabilities by total assets (see Chung and Pruitt, 1995). We do not calculate replacement values using the method proposed by Lindenberg and Ross (1981) because past research has found little qualitative difference between this measure and the simplified version used in this analysis (Chung and Pruitt, 1995). As a robustness check, we also estimated each of our models using the market-to-book ratio as our dependent variable. The market-to-book ratio was calculated as the ratio of the stock price to book equity divided by the number of shares outstanding. Estimates from these models were consistent to those using Tobin's $q$  \n\n### 4.2. Independent variable  \n\nOur primary independent variable is annual CVC investment in millions of dollars (CVC Investment). This variable has the desirable trait of being continuous and observable over time. This allows us to calculate the elasticity of Tobin's $q$ to CVC investment. This measure is calculated as the sum of all dollars invested via all venturing funds of a firm in a year. We further coded venturing programs to reflect the main avenue through which they provide value to the firm: as a narrow investment vehicle (Financial) or as a window on technology (Strategic). Overall, $64\\%$ of these firms stated a strategic motivation for starting their program, and $36\\%$ stipulated a singular desire to reap lucrative financial returns.  \n\nWe used information disclosed by the firm during the announcement of its venturing program to determine program objectives. For each CVC firm in our sample, we conducted an extensive search for announcements of CVC fund formation in hundreds of newspapers, trade magazines, newsletters and other sources available through Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe. For each media mention, two research assistants independently coded the  primary fund  objective  (inter-coder reliability  was $92\\%$ 0.Firms were coded as Unknown when we were unable to confidently discern program objectives. We were able to confirm the espoused CVC objectives for 55 firms of the 171 CVC firms in our sample. The results of nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests suggest that the two samples are from populations with the same distribution (Appendix A, Panel A). Specifically, coded and uncoded CVC firms exhibit levels of investment, capital expenditures, growth, leverage, and size which are similar at a significance level of $z>0.05$  \n\n### 4.3. Control variables  \n\nWe include a number of measures commonly used in the analysis of financial performance as controls (e.g., Berger and Ofek, 1995). A company's size (Firm Size) is calculated as the log of the company's assets. The amount by which a firm is growing (Growth) is calculated as the annual percent change in sales. The degree to which the firm is leveraged (Leverage) is expressed as the ratio of its debt to assets. Capital Expenditures and R&D Expenditures are taken directly from the Compustat data set. In addition, we include measures of average industry $q$ to control for time-variant, industry specific variation. At any point in time, differences in industry profitability may have to do with any number of factors including industry structure, technological innovation, or government regulation. Industry $q$ is calculated as the average $q$ of all firms within a firm's four-digit SIC code in a given year.  \n\n### 4.4.Selectionvariables  \n\nIn a number of models, we control for the fact that firms self-select to invest corporate venture capital by adopting two-stage specifications in line with Maddala (1983) and Heckman (1979). The first stage of these models is used to predict the likelihood that a firm will invest corporate venture capital. To this end, we collected data for three additional measures: Cash Flow, Patent Stock, and Tech Opportunity.  \n\nSince CVC investment is often a considerable capital expenditure, firms with greater cash flow are more likely to have the financial flexibility to invest (Dushnitsky and Lenox, 2005a). We define Cash Flow as income before extraordinary items (i.e., income after interest and taxes) plus depreciation and amortization (Fazzari et al., 1988). Since firms treat R&D as an expense, some studies have added R&D back into the accounting definition of cash flow. Because we control for R&D expenditure separately, we did not follow this procedure.  \n\nWe employ the firm's stock of prior patents (Patent Stock) as a proxy for the firm's absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). According to Hall et al. (2001), patents (and by extension patent stocks) should be a good proxy for knowledge capital, and thus the firm's ability to absorb new knowledge, because it represents the success of an R&D program. Arguably, those firms who are better able to absorb and understand technical knowledge generated by ventures will find it more enticing to invest CVC (Dushnitsky and Lenox, 2005a). We define Patent Stock as the depreciated sum of all patents applied from 1963 to the current year using the NBER's version of U.S. Patent Office Data (Hall et al.,2001).  \n\nFinally, firms are more likely to invest when there are rich technological opportunities within their industry. Tech Opportunity is defined as the average number of citationweighted patents applied for by firms in a given year in a given industry defined by each four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Because this measure is highly skewed, we employ the natural logarithm of Tech Opportunity in our analysis.  \n\n## 5. Analysis and results  \n\nIn Table 1, we present summary statistics and the pairwise correlation matrix for our measures. We see that the average Tobin's $q$ for the firms in our sample was 1.388 in the 1990s. On average, firms invest $\\$1.03\\mathrm{M}$ per year in entrepreneurial ventures. However, this number is skewed by the high number of firms in our sample $(85\\%)$ who do not invest corporate venture capital. The average annual investment among those who establish CVC funds is approximately $\\$6.40$ per year. At the extreme, firms have invested well over $\\$1001$ in CVC in a single year. In terms of intensity of investment, CVC investment represents $0.4\\%$ of firm assets on average compared with $8.1\\%$ for internal research and development. Among those who invest, CVC investments represent, on average, $3\\%$ ofthe firm's annual capital expenditures.  \n\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td colspan=\"5\">Description</td><td>Std.</td><td>Min</td><td>Max</td></tr><tr><td>Tobin's q</td><td colspan=\"5\">Sum of firm equity, long-term debt, and liabilities over firm assets</td><td>1.879</td><td></td><td>56.35</td></tr><tr><td>CVC investment</td><td colspan=\"5\">Log of total corporate venture capital</td><td>0.241</td><td>0</td><td>5.09</td></tr><tr><td>R&D expenditures</td><td colspan=\"5\">invested ($M) Log of research and development</td><td>2.001</td><td>0</td><td>9.19</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditures</td><td colspan=\"5\">expenditures (SM) Log of capital expenditures ($M)</td><td>2.021</td><td>0</td><td>9.66</td></tr><tr><td>Growth</td><td colspan=\"5\">Change in sales ($M) over sales ($M)</td><td>4.151</td><td>-1</td><td>343</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td colspan=\"5\">Ratio of debt ($M) to firm assets ($M)</td><td>0.174</td><td>0</td><td>4.82</td></tr><tr><td>Firm size</td><td colspan=\"5\">Log of firm assets ($M)</td><td>2.042</td><td>0.64</td><td>12.67</td></tr><tr><td>Industry q</td><td colspan=\"5\">Average industry Tobin’s q (by 4-digit</td><td>1.026</td><td>0</td><td>9.77</td></tr><tr><td>Patent stock</td><td colspan=\"5\">SIC code) Log of the depreciated count of patents</td><td></td><td></td><td>8.73</td></tr><tr><td>Cash flow</td><td colspan=\"5\">issued to a firm Log of income after interest and taxes</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>10.50</td></tr><tr><td>Tech opportunity</td><td colspan=\"5\">plus depreciation and amortization (SM) Log of average citations within a 4-digit</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"5\">SIC classification in each year</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Pairwise correlations</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>1.

We find that firms who make larger capital expenditures and who are growing have higher Tobin's $q$ . Finally, we find that Leverage and Firm Size has a significant, negative impact on Tobin's $q$ . The magnitude and sign of the coefficients are consistent with those reported by other scholars (Morck and Yeung, 1991; Lang and Stulz, 1994).  \n\nTable2 CVC investment impact on Tobin's q (1990-1999)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Model</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Specification</td><td>FE</td><td>FE</td><td>Treatment</td><td>FE</td><td>Heckman</td></tr><tr><td>Sample</td><td>Full</td><td>Full</td><td>Full</td><td>Investors</td><td>Investors</td></tr><tr><td>CVC investmenta</td><td></td><td>0.408***</td><td>0.527***</td><td>0.283***</td><td>0.288***</td></tr><tr><td>R&D expenditures</td><td>0.024</td><td>(0.069) 0.006</td><td>(0.131) 0.033***</td><td>(0.074) 0.376**</td><td>(0.069) 0.375**</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditures</td><td>(0.045) 0.138***</td><td>(0.045) 0.135***</td><td>(0.007) 0.119***</td><td>(0.124)</td><td>(0.114)</td></tr><tr><td>Growth</td><td>(0.032)</td><td>(0.032)</td><td>(0.016)</td><td>0.018 (0.084)</td><td>0.016 (0.077)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.014*** (0.003)</td><td>0.014*** (0.003)</td><td>0.030*** (0.003)</td><td>0.117*** (0.012)</td><td>0.117*** (0.011)</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>-0.731*** (0.127)</td><td>-0.724*** (0.127)</td><td>-0.226*** (0.068)</td><td>-0.783 (0.527)</td><td>-0.780 (0.484)</td></tr><tr><td>Firm size</td><td>-0.420*** (0.051)</td><td>-0.437***</td><td>-0.123***</td><td> 0.214</td><td>-0.216</td></tr><tr><td>Industry q</td><td>0.771***</td><td>(0.051) 0.760***</td><td>(0.016) 0.688***</td><td>(0.132) 0.622***</td><td>(0.121) 0.622***</td></tr><tr><td>Year fixed effects</td><td>(0.027) Included</td><td>(0.027) Included</td><td>(0.012) Included</td><td>(0.058) Included</td><td>(0.053) Included</td></tr><tr><td>Firm fixed effects</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Included</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Included</td><td>Included</td><td>Included</td><td>Included</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>8630</td><td>8630</td><td>8630</td><td>1160b</td><td>1160b</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firms</td><td>1173</td><td>1173</td><td>1173</td><td>171</td><td>171</td></tr><tr><td>Overall R2c</td><td>0.192</td><td>0.198</td><td></td><td>0.330</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>82.34***</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>F-test</td><td>85.32***</td><td></td><td></td><td>26.77***</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wald x2</td><td></td><td></td><td>16143***</td><td></td><td>5360***</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nStandard errors in parentheses. a In Model 3, CVC Investment is treated as a binary variable where all non-zero investments equal one. b In Models 5 and 6, we reduce the sample to only those frms that pursue CVC investment. This does not include the variance explained by the firm fixed effects. \\*\\* $p^{<0.01}$ \\*\\*\\* $p^{<0.001}$  \n\nIn Model 2, we add our main independent variable, CVC Investment. We find that investments in entrepreneurial ventures by established firms have a positive, significant impact on the  firm's  Tobin's $q$ . That is, firms that pursue corporate venture capital experiencehigher values of Tobin's $q$ than their non-investing industry peers.' The coefficient estimates for the control variables are consistent with Model 1.  \n\nAnother possible explanation for our findings is that those firms who invest CVC may be of a superior type than firms who do not invest. CVC investment may serve as a signal of this underlying superiority and not reflect the hypothesized relationship between investment and the creation of firm value. Alternatively, firms who invest CVC may simultaneously invest in some other unobserved factor that in turn leads to higher Tobin's $q$ .8 At the heart of this issue is that firms self-select to invest CVC based on their attributes and context, which are not fully observed by the researcher. In the presence of self-selection, our previous estimates may overstate the effect of CVC on firm value creation.  \n\nAs a first attempt to address this issue, in analyzing the full sample that includes CVC as well as non-CVC investing firms, we adopt a treatment effects model to account for firms’ self-selection to invest CVC (Maddala, 1983). In Model 3, we estimate two relationships: (1) a set of factors that drive the decision to invest corporate venture capital, and (2) the effect that decision has on Tobin's $q$ . To operationalize our treatment model, we create a binary version of CVC Investment where all levels of investment greater than zero are assigned the value of one. In the first stage, we assume that the decision to invest corporate venture capital is driven by the firm's innovativeness (Patent Stock), the availability of funds (Cash Flow), the asset base of the firm (Firm Size), and the technology opportunities present within the firm's industry (Tech Opportunity). Model 3 presents the estimates for the treatment effects model.? We find that, even after controlling for self-selection, CVC Investment continues to have a significant, positive impact on Tobin's $q$ . By comparing the $q$ levels of a firm that is likely to invest CVC to those of a firm that is also likely to invest but did not (Greene, 2000), we calculate that a CVC investing firm experiences an average ^net' increase of 0.51 (std. 0.007) in its Tobin's $q$ As a further robustness test, we limit our sample to only those firms who invest CVC and re-estimate the specification in Model 2. In other words, we estimate the impact of the magnitude of CVC investment on Tobin's $q$ given that a firm chooses to invest CVC. Investing more in new ventures allows a firm to either (a) access a greater number of new ventures (i.e., more opportunities to conduct and learn from due-diligence, as well as a chance to seed multiple complementary ventures and increases demand for parent products), or (b) enjoy greater access to their portfolio companies (i.e., greater bargaining power and hence more chances to secure board seats, deploy liaisons or ensure development of complementary products). In Model 4, we continue to observe a positive and significant coefficient on CVC Investment for our restricted sample. We are not surprised by the slight decrease in the magnitude of the coefficient since, assuming decreasing returns to CVC investment, removing the marginal impact of investing that first dollar of corporate venture capital should have the greatest impact.  \n\nTo address the possibility that self-selection is biasing the marginal effect of CVC on firm's $q$ , Model 5 adopts a Heckman selection model using the same first-stage selection equation used in the treatment effects model.1° Particularly, the Heckman model corrects for the fact that the marginal effect of CVC on firm's $q$ in the limited sample (i.e., solely investors) may be biased, whereas the treatment effects model facilitated the interpretation of Tobin's $q$ levels between CVC and non-CVC investing firms (i.e., full sample). In Model 5, we find that even controlling for self-selection, CVC Investment has a positive, significant impact onTobin's $q$  \n\nThus, we find that firms that pursue corporate venture capital experience more value creation, compared to firms who do not (Model 2 and 3). Moreover among those firms who invest corporate venture capital, we find that greater CVC investment increases firm value (Models 4 and 5). In other words, increases in firm value are associated not only with the existence of CVC effort but also with the magnitude of the investment. If we consider the financial impact of investing in new ventures, we find that $\\$10$ spent on CVC raises Tobin's $q$ by 0.20 (using Model 5 estimates). Based on these estimates, the change in Tobin's $q$ for $\\$10$ spent on internal R&D is 0.26. Thus, CVC stands up well in comparison.  \n\nOur sample covers a multitude ofindustries. Given the pros and cons of corporate venture capital, it is likely that the payoffs to CVC are highly contingent on industry conditions. For example, the health of the market for IPO's is critical. To the extent that firms tend to invest in ventures that are similar (in terms of underlying technologies and markets), CVC payoffs will be greater in growing industries with rich technological opportunities.  \n\nWhile our firm fixed effects will capture stable sector differences, pooling the samples may mask underlying heterogeneity in the coefficient estimates themselves. To address whether inter-industry variability is driving our results, we break our sample down by industry sector for the six highest CVC investing sectors: Chemicals, Devices, Information Technology, Metals, Pharmaceuticals, and Vehicles. Replicating Model 2 at the sector level, we find that the benefits of CVC investment only accrue to firms in certain sectors (See Table 3). In particular, only for firms in the devices and information sectors do we find that CVC is associated with increases in Tobin's $q$ (Models 7 and 8, respectively). For the remaining sectors (Models 6, 9, 10, 11), we have no confidence that the impact of CVC is greater than zero.  \n\nThe finding of statistically significant effect in Models 7 and 8 give us greater confidence that cross-industry variation is not completely driving our findings. We explicitly include a control group of all non-CVC firms who operate in the same industry. If cross-industry variation in Tobin's $q$ is driving our results, we would expect all the firms in a focal industry (and not just CVC investing firms), to exhibit different Tobin's $q$ values.  \n\nWhile we should be cautious in inferring too much from the lack of a statistically significant coefficient across different samples, the pattern of results in the sector analysis is consistent with our proposition that strategically oriented CVC will create more value than narrowly financially oriented CVC. Prior research suggests that information technology firms typically engage in CVC as a window on novel technology (Chesbrough, 2oo0o). In contrast, firms in mature industries like chemicals and metals undertake CVC mainly as a way to gain superior financial return on investment (Sykes, 1986). The information technology sector is characterized by greater technological opportunity and weak appropriability (Cohen et al., 2001), and is the most fertile ground for scanning and sourcing of external technologies, i.e., pursuing a window on technology. Thus, the results presented in Table 3 are consistent with the view that corporate venture capital is most valued as a window on technology.  \n\nTable3 CVC investment impact on Tobin's $q$ by sector (1990-1999)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Model</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Sector</td><td>Chemicals</td><td>Devices</td><td>Information</td><td>Metals</td><td>Pharma</td><td>Vehicles</td></tr><tr><td>CVC investment</td><td>0.089</td><td>0.983**</td><td>0.510***</td><td>1.162</td><td>0.082</td><td>-0.026</td></tr><tr><td>R&D expenditures</td><td>(0.261) -0.011 (0.063)</td><td>(0.375) 0.020 (0.249)</td><td>(0.096) -0.001 (0.109)</td><td>(0.595) 0.129</td><td>(0.560) 2.335**</td><td>(0.225) 0.100</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditures</td><td>0.084 (0.045)</td><td>0.149 (0.205)</td><td>0.081 (0.063)</td><td>(0.070) 0.105***</td><td>(0.849) 1.426**</td><td>(0.071) -0.043</td></tr><tr><td>Growth</td><td>0.005 (0.004)</td><td>-0.163 (0.188)</td><td>0.110*** (0.012)</td><td>(0.030) 0.271*** (0.077)</td><td>(0.549) 0.003 (0.012)</td><td>(0.046) 0.253* (0.111)</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>-0.113 (0.230)</td><td>-1.707*** (0.338)</td><td>-0.402 (0.437)</td><td>0.186 (0.169)</td><td>-3.536 (2.126)</td><td>-0.663** (0.236)</td></tr><tr><td>Firm size</td><td>-0.278*** (0.078)</td><td>-0.986*** (0.263)</td><td>-0.077 (0.123)</td><td>-0.231*** (0.052)</td><td>-5.799*** (0.804)</td><td>0.014 (0.097)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry q</td><td>0.923*** (0.057)</td><td>0.855*** (0.126)</td><td>0.389*** (0.050)</td><td>0.966*** (0.054)</td><td>0.469 (0.327)</td><td>0.962*** (0.091)</td></tr><tr><td>Year fixedeffects Firm fixed effects</td><td>Included Included</td><td>Included Included</td><td>Included Included</td><td>Included Included</td><td>Included Included</td><td>Included Included</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>777</td><td>783</td><td>1350</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firms</td><td>112</td><td>110</td><td>196</td><td>319 41</td><td>357 46</td><td>506 65</td></tr><tr><td>Overall R2a</td><td>0.239</td><td>0.085</td><td>0.296</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>F-test</td><td>23.23***</td><td>7.61***</td><td>19.60***</td><td>0.481 35.68***</td><td>0.176 6.93***</td><td>0.228 16.11***</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nStandard errors in parentheses. a This does not include the variance explained by the firm fixed effects. \\* $p<0.05$ \\*\\* $p^{<0.01}$ \\*\\*\\* $p^{<0.001}$  \n\nTo this point, the analysis provides limited direct evidence that the relationship between CVC and Tobin's $q$ is driven primarily by strategic benefits. If we break our data down by program objective, we find that the average investment by firms who pursue CVC as a window on technology is slightly lower than those who pursue CVC for narrow financial gain $\\mathrm{(\\mathbb{S}5.8M}$ Vs. $\\$6.50$ per year on average), but they tend to invest for substantially longer periods of time (see Total Years CVC). Strategically focused CVC firms exhibit higher values of Tobin's $q$ (mean of 2.63 vs. 1.33).12  \n\nTo help tease this apart more systematically, we break down CVC Investment by the espoused goal of the fund. The analysis in Model 12 (Table 4) is analogous to Model 3, with the addition of three terms: CVC\\*Strategic, CVC\\*Financial and CVC\\* Unknown. We find a positive, significant coefficient for $C V C^{*}$ Strategic. On the other hand, we find a negative, non-significant coefficient on CVC\\*Financial. While the coefficient for $C V C^{*}$ Unknownis positive and differs from zero significantly, it does not differ significantly from that of CVC\\*Strategic( $F$ -stat $:=0.71$ ). The coefficient does, however, differ significantly from the coefficient on CVC\\*Financial ( $F{\\mathrm{-stat}}=5.53$ 0. These results suggest that investing in new ventures with the goal of winning strategic benefits may create value, while financially driven venturing activity may actually lead to the destruction of firm value.  \n\nTable 4 CVC investment impact on Tobin's $q$ by program goal (1990-1999)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Model</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Specification</td><td>FE</td><td>FE</td><td>FE</td><td>FE</td><td>Heckman</td></tr><tr><td>Sample</td><td>Full</td><td>Investors</td><td>Information sector</td><td>Information and investors</td><td>Information and investors</td></tr><tr><td>CVC investment</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CVC*Strategic</td><td>0.324* (0.141)</td><td>0.213* (0.089)</td><td>0.335* (0.159)</td><td>0.370* (0.200)</td><td>0.370* (0.183)</td></tr><tr><td>CVC*Financial</td><td>-0.552 (0.423)</td><td>-0.387 (0.394)</td><td>-1.803 * (0.934)</td><td>-0.749 (1.352)</td><td>- 0.748</td></tr><tr><td>CVC*Unknown</td><td>0.461*** (0.080)</td><td>0.314*** (0.076)</td><td>0.637*** (0.117)</td><td>0.497***</td><td>(1.211) 0.498***</td></tr><tr><td>R&D expenditures</td><td>0.003 (0.045)</td><td>0.340**</td><td>- 0.019</td><td>(0.151) 0.100</td><td>(0.136) 0.100</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditures</td><td>0.135***</td><td>(0.125) 0.014</td><td>(0.109) 0.078</td><td>(0.251) 0.128</td><td>(0.225) 0.128</td></tr><tr><td>Growth</td><td>(0.032) 0.014***</td><td>(0.084) 0.116***</td><td>(0.063) 0.110***</td><td>(0.154) 0.110***</td><td>(0.138) 0.110***</td></tr><tr><td>Leverage</td><td>(0.003) -0.722***</td><td>(0.012) -0.712</td><td>(0.012) -0.382</td><td>(0.017) -1.599</td><td>(0.015) -1.598</td></tr><tr><td>Firm size</td><td>(0.127) -0.437***</td><td>(0.528) -0.217</td><td>(0.436) -0.077</td><td>(1.305) -0.082</td><td>(1.169) -0.081</td></tr><tr><td>Industry q</td><td>(0.051) 0.759***</td><td>(0.132) 0.623***</td><td>(0.123) 0.379***</td><td>(0.280) 0.701***</td><td>(0.251) 0.701***</td></tr><tr><td>Year fixed effects</td><td>(0.027) Included</td><td>(0.058) Included</td><td>(0.050) Included</td><td>(0.118) Included</td><td>(0.105) Included</td></tr><tr><td>Firm fixed effects</td><td>Included</td><td>Included</td><td>Included</td><td>Included</td><td>Included</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firms</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>8630</td><td>1160</td><td>1350</td><td>433</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>433</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1173</td><td>171</td><td>196</td><td>69</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>Overall R2a</td><td>0.198</td><td>0.347</td><td>0.297</td><td>0.358</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>F-test Wald x2</td><td>72.86***</td><td>23.96***</td><td>17.79***</td><td>8.41***</td><td>2236***</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nStandard errors in parentheses. a This does not include the variance explained by the firm fixed effects. \\* $p^{<0.05}$ \\*\\* $p^{<0.01}$ \\*\\*\\* $p^{<0.001}$  \n\nAs a robustness test, we limit our sample to only those firms who invest CVC. Please note that in Model 12, all non-CVC investors will have a zero for the three interaction terms. By limiting our sample to only investors, we partially control for firms decision to invest CVC. In Model 13, we continue to find a positive coefficient for CVC\\*Strategic and a negative coefficient for CVC\\*Financial. As a further test, we limit our sample to only the information technology sector (including all firms in that sector, investors and non-investors) to ensure that our results are not driven by sector differences. In Model 14, the pattern between CVC\\*Strategic and CVC\\*Financial remains. Controlling for selection in this way leads to significance on both of these coefficient estimates. Finally, we limit ourselves to only firms who invest CVC and are members of the information technology sector. In Models 15 and 16, we estimate a fixed-effect specification. In Model 16, we adopt the Heckman selection specification.13 In both cases, we continue to find that those firms who pursue CVC for strategic reasons realize a positive, significant increase in firm value creation while those who pursue CVC for financial reasons realize either no or negative value creation.  \n\n## 6. Discussion  \n\nWe present evidence that corporate venture capital investment is associated with the creation of firm value. We find that this relationship is most salient in the devices and information technology sectors. Moreover, we present evidence that the contribution of corporate venture capital investment is strongest when it is focused on attaining a window on technology rather than a purely narrow return on investment.  \n\nTo be clear, we find that greater investment in CVC leads to higher Tobin's $q$ .We recognize that the validity of Tobin's $q$ as a measure of firm value is contingent on the assumption that the capital markets (i.e., investors) rationally price firm's securities (which are the numerator of Tobin's $q$ ). In the field of strategy, Tobin's $q$ has been used as a measure of firm's rents, or value creation (Montgomery and Wernerfelt, 1988), and it had been put to use in numerous studies. Accordingly, we interpret the positive and significant impact of CVC on firm's $q$ to imply that corporate venture capital is associated with firm's value creation. To allay concerns that our results are driven purely by the internet bubble of the later 1990s, we excluded the bubble year (1996-1999) and re-ran our analysis and found consistent results.  \n\nTo ensure the association between firm's CVC and its Tobin's $q$ are not an artifact of an unobserved factor, we addressed potential heterogeneity across firms within a sector. 14 Our firm fixed effects help address this concern in part, by accounting for stable differences between firms (such as managerial talent). We further account for such self-selection in the decision to pursue CVC by adopting our treatment and Heckman selection models. These models require us to explicitly model the factors driving CVC behavior. Our results are robust to these specifications.  \n\nAs with all analyses, we should be cautious in our interpretation. Our analysis of firm CVC orientation is constrained by the availability of announcement data. The difficulty in gathering announcement data limited our sample to the 1990s. Thus our interaction results may fail to detect a shift over time in the relative benefit of a strategic vs. purely financial orientation. Furthermore, while we do not find other systematic differences in the attributes of coded CVC and uncoded CVC firms, we tended to find announcement data for more research intensive firms (Appendix A, Panel A). It may very well be that the benefits of a strategic orientation are only realized when firms possess a set of complementary research capabilities that allow them to capitalize on the knowledge gained from invested ventures.  \n\nThis study presents evidence that CVC investment is associated with the creation of firm value, particularly when it is aimed at strategically harnessing new ventures. It remains unanswered, however, whether investing firms appropriate the value in full. Gompers and Lerner (1998) observe that corporate venture capitalists tend to invest at a premium compared to independent VCs, and speculate that existing investors, or the ventures themselves, bargain away some of the value.1 Future work should further explore whether CVC creates value to begin with, and if so, what proportion is appropriated by the investing firm. Variation in the investment environment (e.g., hot vs. cold financial markets) as well as different bargaining positions (e.g., CVC prominence in the VC community) may prove useful instruments in such future exploration.  \n\nAnother interesting question that we are unable to address with our data is whether the differential advantage in strategically oriented CVC firms is driven by the establishment of specific mechanisms for knowledge transfer, superior ability to pick portfolio ventures, or a combination of the two. Strategically oriented CVC firms may owe their success to the specific practices they adopt to funnel knowledge from ventures to their internal research efforts. Alternatively, they may be better able to identify venture partners from whom they have much to learn. We leave an exploration of these questions to future research.  \n\n## 7. Conclusion  \n\nBased on a large sample of all CVC investing firms and their industry peers, we find that corporate venture capitalists experience increased value creation, as measured by levels of Tobin's $q$ . Our analyses suggest that CVC is likely to create firm value only when pursued for strategic reasons. A financially oriented firm is less likely to be able to benefit from such investment activity as structural deficiencies (misaligned incentives, internal conflicts, and incompatible objectives) are likely to overshadow CVC potential advantages (valuable complementary assets, preferential information about the underlying technology). However, if a firm actively pursues CVC in order to harness novel technology it may realize innovative benefits that will compensate for potentially lower financial returns.  \n\nThe possibility that equity stakes in entrepreneurial ventures may provide a window on technology and aid in firm innovation efforts has important implications. Central to competitive success is the ability to acquire valuable resources and capabilities that allow firms to achieve favorable strategic positions (Teece et al., 1997). When unable to internally generate such assets, successful firms exploit knowledge external to the firm (Henderson and Cockburn, 1994). Corporate venture capital may be an important tool to create firm value by providing a valuable window on novel technologies and practices.  \n\n## Appendix A.

HISRICH Case Western Reserve University  \n\nAMYPOLONCHEK Oklahoma Department of Vocational and Technical Education  \n\nFourpotential sourcesof differences betweenventurecapital(VC)firms were examinedventurestage of interest,amount of assistanceprovided by the VC, VC firm size, and geographic region where located. Through a questionnaire,149 venture capitalists provided data about their firms, about what they look for in evaluating an investment,and about how they work with a portfolio company following an investment.  \n\nFirms were divided into four groups based on venture stage of interest. The earlier the investment stage, the greater the interest in potential investments built upon proprietary products, product uniqueness, and high growth markets.Late-stage investors weremore interested in demonstrated market acceptance.  \n\nThere were no differences by stage regarding the desired qualities of management. However, afiter the investment was made, earlier stage investors attached more importance to spending their time evaluating and recruiting managers.Earlier stage investors sought ventures with higher potential returns--a $42\\%$ hurdlerateofreturnfortheearlieststageinvestorversus $33\\%$ forthelate-stage investor.  \n\nLate-stage investors spent more time evaluating a potential investment.However,after the investment was made, there was little difference in the amount of time spent assisting the portfolio company.There were,however,differences in the significance that VCs attached to particular post-investmentactivities.  \n\nFirms were split into three groups based upon the amount of time the VC spent with a portfolio company after an investment was made as lead investor. The most active group averaged over 35 hours per month perinvestment,and the least activegroup averaged less than seven hours.  \n\nThe difference in assistance provided was not strongly tied to differences in investment stage of interest. There were major differences in the importance the VCs attached to their post-investment activities. Not surprisingly, high involvement VCs viewed their activities as more important.  \n\nBased upon the amount of capital they managed, firms were also split into three groups. Average fund size varied from 278 to 12 million dollars. The larger firms had more professionals and managed more money per professional. The large firms provided the least, and the medium-sized firms the most, assistance to portfoliocompanies.  \n\nLarge firms also made larger individual investments. Even though they invested over half their funds in late-stage investments whereas smaller firms focused on the earlier stages, the large firms were still a major source of early stage financing.  \n\nThere were no differences between geographic regions in the proportion of investments where the venture capital firm served as lead investor. There were, however, major regional differences in investment stages of interest. Also differences were observed between regions that were not a result of differing size and investment stage.  \n\n# INTRODUCTION  \n\nAlthough the importance of venture capital to entrepreneurial firms and these firms' subsequent contributions to economic development has been well documented, most research on venture capital has treated the industry as homogeneous (Fried and Hisrich 1988). However, as Bygrave and Timmons (1992) point out, there is significant heterogeneity in the industry. Some research, e.g., Robinson (1987), Florida and Kenney (1988a, 1988b), Sapienza and Timmons (1989), has begun to examine these differences.  \n\nThese differences are not just of interest to academics. An understanding of the differences among venture capitalists (VCs) can be helpful to the entrepreneur in search of capital. By understanding what VCs are looking for in an investment, the entrepreneur increases his/her chances of finding capital. By understanding how VCs behave after an investment, the entrepreneur increases his/her chances of selecting the right VC investor.  \n\nVCs can also benefit from a better knowledge of how other VCs operate. VCs both collaborate with, and sometimes compete against, each other. In addition, some of the differences are philosophical in nature. To the extent that the performance implications of differing VCs’ philosophies can be evaluated, the overall performance of the VC industry can be improved.  \n\nFinally, public policy-makers can benefit from an understanding of VC differences. This understanding can improve the availability of venture capital, a major concern of public policy-makers at both the regional and national levels.  \n\n## Hypotheses  \n\nThe hypotheses tested in this study were formulated based on the results of previous research on the venture capital industry. These hypotheses can be grouped into four areas: venture stage, staff assistance per investee, firm size, and geographical differences. There is no overall theory driving the research on VC differences, but two perspectives run throughout much of the literature—stages of development (Ruhnka and Young 1987) and strategic choice (Robinson 1987).  \n\nStages of development explain VC differences by looking, not directly at the VC, but rather at the companies in the VC's investment portfolio. Companies develop in stages with the characteristics and needs of the company varying by stage. Very young organizations are less developed. As a result they are riskier and require more non-cash resources (e.g., business assistance) from the outside. In addition to explaining differences by venture stage, the stages-of-development concept significantly impacts the other three types of VC differences studied.  \n\nBecause early-stage companies require more assistance, VCs that provide a high level of assistance should invest in early-stage companies and those that provide a low level of assistance in late-stage companies. Because late-stage companies have greater needs for cash, large VC firms will invest in late-stage companies and small VC firms in early stage. Finally, the geographic location of the VC firm influences the developmental stage of companies in the pool available for investment. Thus all three types of differences are explained by the stage make-up of the VC's portfolio.  \n\nAlthough the strategic choice perspective does not disagree with the basic concept of developmental stages, it argues that the concept does not explain all of the differences between VCs. Many exist as a result of deliberate choice by the VC. As MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian (1988) comment in their study of staff assistance per investee, \"VCs exhibit different involvement levels solely because they elect to do so\" (p.27).  \n\n## Venture Stage  \n\nRobinson (1987) found that venture capital firms differ significantly in the stage in the life of a new venture in which they invest. According to Bygrave and Timmons (1992), the differences between investing in early-stage and late-stage ventures are so great that investors focusing on late-stage investments, particularly small leveraged buyouts, should not be considered venture capitalists. Pratt (1989) has strongly disagreed with this position, arguing that the differences are not as great as the similarities.  \n\nThe stages-of-development literature describes the developmental process for new businesses in terms of sequential stages (e.g., Churchill and Lewis 1983; Galbraith 1982). Ruhnka and Young (1987,1991) conducted an empirical study that showed thatVCs viewed new businesses as developing in stages. They created a model of the development process based on the views of VCs with the stages of development based not merely on financial needs, but also on the strategic, marketing, and management characteristics of the venture. Similarly, Fried and Hisrich (1991) found that early stage investors looked for ventures based upon unique, proprietary products with high market growth potential, whereas late-stage investors were more interested in the capabilities of management. Based on this research, the following hypotheses wereformulated:  \n\nHla:VCsinvestingatearlystagesofdevelopmentplacemoreemphasis onunique. proprietary products and high growth markets than do VCs investing at late stages of development.  \n\nHIb: VCs investing at late stages of development place more emphasis on the management characteristicsofexistingmanagementthandoVCsinvestingatearlystagesof development.  \n\nAccording to financial theory, VCs should expect higher returns from higher risk investments. Early stage ventures generally face considerable management, market, and technological uncertainty. As a result, VCs feel that the risk of loss of their investment is much higher for early-stage investments. Ruhnka and Young found that VCs' demands for rates of return were $73\\%$ and $55\\%$ at the seed and start-up stages and declined to $35\\%$ for late-stage investments. Plumer (1987) found similar VC expectations. These findings are reflected in the following hypothesis:  \n\nHlc: VCs investing in early stages of development expect higher returns on investment than do VCs investing in late stages of development.  \n\nRuhnka and Young also found that VCs were very concerned with the risk of management failure in the early stages. As firms matured and management became more proven, this concern declined. Sapienza and Timmons (1989) found that early-stage investors were much more involved in management recruiting. Fried and Hisrich (1991) concurred and also found that after an investment had been made, early-stage investors were more involved in evaluating the management team. These results are the basis for the following:  \n\nHld: VCs investing at early stages place more emphasis on evaluating and recruiting management than do VCs investing at late stages.  \n\nBeing less developed as an organization, early-stage ventures require more non-cash resources from outside. Because the management team is not established, the VC may need to be more involved in the operations of an early-stage venture than a late-stage venture. Rosenstein et al. (1993) found that early-stage VCs were more involved in negotiating employment contracts, contacting potential vendors, evaluating product/market opportunities, formulating and evaluating marketing plans, and contacting potential customers. Sapienza and Timmons (1989) found that the VC's role as a financier, professional contact, and industry contact was more important in the early stage than in the late stage. These results are reflected in the following two hypotheses:  \n\nHle: VCs investing at early stages attach more importance to making introductions to potential customers and service providers than do VCs investing at later stages.  \n\nHlf VCs investing at early stages attach more importance to assisting management with operational planning than do VCs investing at late stages.  \n\nBecause the management team can be incomplete in early stages and the VC is more involved with operations, Gomez-Mejia, Balkin, and Welbourne (1990) found that the early stage VC needs to spend more time with the portfolio company than the late stage VC. Similarly, Barney et al. (1989) suggest that VCs can better control the business risk associated with early-stage investing by remaining in close contact with the venture.  \n\nHowever, MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian (1988) found that differences in the level of VC involvement are not stage-related. In addition, in an exploratory study, Fried and Hisrich did not observe any differences in time spent by stage. Because of the conflicting research, the following hypothesis is tentative:  \n\n$H l g$ : VCs investing at early stages spend more time with a portfolio company than do VCs investing at late stages.  \n\n### Staff Assistance per Investee  \n\nRobinson (1987) and Gorman and Sahlman (1986) found large differences in the amount of time VCs spend with portfolio companies. Gorman and Sahlman attribute much of this difference to the investment stage composition of the VC's portfolio. It appears that assistance from a VC will be more useful to a venture at an early stage of development because it is more likely that the venture's management team is not well developed. VCs providing a high level of assistance should be willing to assume a higher level of business risk, because they can better control this risk due to their close contact with the business. Firms providing a high level of management assistance should therefore be interested in early-stage investments, as is reflected in the following tentative hypothesis, which, ignoring causation, is similar to H1g:  \n\nH2a: VCs who provide a large amount of staff assistance invest more at early stages of development than do VCs who provide low levels of assistance.  \n\nHow do the activities that high involvement VCs undertake with their portfolio companies differ from those of low involvement VCs? MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian (1988) conducted a study in which VCs were grouped based upon the amount of effort they expended on an activity relative to the effort expended by the entrepreneur. High involvement VCs were more involved than low effort VCs in developing professional support groups and soliciting customers or distributors. They were also more involved in obtaining alternative sources of debt and equity financing. Searching for candidates for the management team, and interviewing and selecting the management team were also areas where the level of VC effort varied. They also found high effort VCs more involved in developing actual products or services, developing production or service techniques, selecting vendors and equipment, formulating marketing plans, and monitoring operating performance. Whereas MacMillan et al.'s study was based upon VC effort relative to entrepreneur effort rather than the importance attached to the activity, it is reasonable to assume that VCs put the most effort into activities that they view as most important, hence the following four hypotheses:  \n\nH2b: VCs who provide a high level of staff assistance attach more importance to making introductions to potential customers, suppliers, and service providers than do VCs who provide alow level of assistance.  \n\n$H2c!$ VCs who provide a high level of assistance attach more importance to seeking additionalfinancingthan doVCswhoprovide a lowlevel of assistance.  \n\nH2d: VCs who provide a high level of assistance attach more importance to recruiting management than do VCs who provide a low level of assistance.  \n\n$H2e$ : VCs who provide a high level of assistance attach more importance to assisting with operational planning than do VCs who provide a low level of assistance.  \n\nSapienza (1992) found that there was a clear positive correlation between the frequency of VC-entrepreneur interaction and the friendliness of the relationship, suggesting the following hypothesis:  \n\nH2f. VCs who provide a high level of assistance attach more importance to serving as the entrepreneur's confidant than do VCs who provide a low level of assistance.  \n\n### Firm Size  \n\nThe amount of money the average VC firm has under management has increased dramatically since the late 1970s. However, the amount of professional staff in these firms has not increased proportionally (Fried and Hisrich 1991). Hence large firms must either be investing in larger increments and/or having each VC in the firm monitor more investments. Bygrave and Timmons (1992) found that large firms were making significantly larger investments. These research findings are the basis for the following:  \n\nH3a: Large VC firms have higher minimum and maximum investment levels than do small VCfirms.  \n\nBygrave and Timmons feel that firms have managed this growth in investment size by making more late-stage investments where it is easier to invest large sums, which is reflected in the following hypotheses:  \n\nH3b: Large VC firms invest more at late stages of development than do small firms.  \n\nH3c: Small VC firms invest more at early stages of development than do large firms.  \n\n### Geographical Differences  \n\nFlorida and Kenney (1988a, 1988b) indicate that there are differences between VC firms located in different geographic regions. They found three types of regional VC complexes: (1) technology-oriented complexes like Silicon Valley, which are located close to concentrations of high technology businesses and therefore invest most of their money locally; (2) finance-oriented complexes like New York, which are located close to major financial institutions and invest most of their money outside of their region; and (3) hybrid complexes like Boston. In Florida and Kenney's view, the finance-oriented VCs invest by participating in investment syndicates led by technology-oriented VCs. Thus, the VCs in technologyoriented complexes should be lead investors in a much higher percentage of investments than should VCs from finance-oriented complexes. Florida and Kenney's findings are the basis for the following hypothesis:  \n\nH4a: The extent to which a VC serves as lead investor will vary by geographic region, with VCs in technology-oriented complexes like Silicon Valley serving as lead more than VCs in finance-oriented complexes like New York.  \n\nFlorida and Kenney's work did not address the potential for regions to vary by investment stage of interest. However, Gupta and Sapienza (1992) found that early stage investors preferred to invest close to home. Therefore it appears that VCs from finance-oriented complexes are more likely to be late-stage investors and VCs from technology-oriented centers more likely to be early-stage investors. Given the close historical ties between VCs and financial institutions in the finance-oriented complexes, one might expect these VCs to be more comfortable with late-stage investments that are more similar in nature to traditional financial activities. In their exploratory study, Fried and Hisrich found differences in stage of investment between the three regions they studied, which is reflected in the following:  \n\nH4b: Investment stages of interest will vary by geographic regions, with VCs from technology-oriented complexes like Silicon Valley investing more in early stages and VCs from finance-oriented complexes like New York investing more in late stages.  \n\nIn the qualitative portion of their study, Florida and Kenney also argued that there were other geographic differences, such as Silicon Valley VCs having tighter networks than Massachusetts VCs. Fried and Hisrich (1991) developed this idea further, arguing that there could be differences between regions based upon regional characteristics (geography, history, and economy), industrial culture (risk-taking versus conservative, formal versus informal), and organization and management orientation (organizational commitment and management styles). Whereas numerous differences may exist, research on this topic has been quite limited. However, Florida and Kenney, Fried and Hisrich, and Bygrave and Timmons (1992) all feel that VC firms in Silicon Valley are part of much tighter networks than VCs in other regions. As a result, they can assist their portfolio companies by providing access to their network. The findings of these studies are the basis of the final hypothesis:  \n\nH4c: VCs in Silicon Valley attach more importance to making introductions to potential customers, suppliers, and service providers than do VCs in other regions.  \n\n# METHODOLOGY  \n\nData were gathered through a mail questionnaire in which VCs were asked about investment criteria using closed-end questions in the same manner as MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha (1985). Their responses were given on a four-point scale, with 4 being an essential criterion, $3=$ important, $2=$ desirable,and $1=$ irrelevant.  \n\nVCs were asked about the importance of various types of management assistance provided to portfolio companies. This topic was addressed through closed-ended questions in the same manner as Gorman and Sahlman (1986). Responses were given on a five-point scale, with 5 being very important and 1 being unimportant.  \n\nFirms were also asked to indicate the composition of their portfolio by investment stage using Pratt's stages (Venture Economics 1989). An open-ended question asked VCs what they thought were significant differences in the industry.  \n\nThe questionnaire was sent to general partners of 491 firms listed in Pratt's Guide to Venture Capital Sources. Two mailings of the survey were made, resulting in 149 responses, a much larger sample than in any of the earlier studies.  \n\nVenture stage was split in four groups based upon the following formulas:  \n\n.Earliest—More than $40\\%$ of investments in seed stage   \n.

The Mixed group consisted of firms that did not fit into any of the previous three categories.  \n\nFor each of the other dimensions being tested, the sample was split into groups depending on where a natural break occurred. When the venture capitalist was a lead investor, staff assistance was provided to the average investee. “High staff assistance’ was provided if the assistance provided by the venture capitalist as lead investor was greater than or equal to 20 hours per month; “medium staff assistance' if the assistance provided was less than 20 hours per month but greater than 10 hours per month; and “low staff assistance’ if the assistance provided was less than 10 hours per month.  \n\nFirm size was also split into three groups. Large firms had total funds greater than 100 million dollars, medium-sized firms had total funds less than 1o0 million dollars but greater than or equal to 25 million dollars, and small firms had less than 25 million dollars.  \n\nThe geographic regions chosen for this study were Massachusetts; Illinois, Minnesota. and Michigan (hereafter referred to as Midwest); Palo Alto and Menlo Park (hereafter referred to as Silicon Valley); Northern California (San Francisco and its environs); New York: Southern California; and Texas.  \n\nMeans were computed for each variable, and an F test was used to test for differences between the various levels of each grouping. In some cases, two levels of a grouping were tested against each other using a Bonferroni t-test. Appendices 1-4 provide a detailed listing of the means and test results.  \n\nTable 1.

The earlier the stage, the higher the interest in proprietary products, product uniqueness, and high growth markets. Late-stage investors were much more interested in demonstrated market acceptance.  \n\nHypothesis 1b was not supported. Although several management characteristics were examined, the VCs' selection criteria for management did not differ by stage.  \n\nHypothesis 1c was only partially supported. Hurdle IRRs ranged from $42.2\\%$ forearliest stage investorsto $33.52\\%$ , but the differences were significant to only the .1 confidence level. A two-way test between the earliest stage and late-stage groups was not significant at the .05 level. When returns were measured in terms of multiples of investment (how important is it that the venture willreturn at least $10\\times$ investment over five to 10 years?), the differences were significant at the .01 level.  \n\nHypothesis 1d was supported. The earlier the stage, the greater the importance of the VC in evaluating and recruiting management.  \n\nHypothesis le was partially supported. Early-stage investors attach much more importance to making introductions to potential customers and suppliers. However, the difference was not significant for introductions to service providers.  \n\nHypothesis 1f was supported. Earliest stage investors viewed assisting with operationa! planning as important.  \n\nHypothesis 1g was not supported. The differences between stages in the amount of time spent with a portfolio company were not significant. A two-way test between the earliest stage group and the late-stage group was also not significant.  \n\n## Staff Assistance  \n\nHypothesis 2a was not supported (Table 2).

A two-way test between the high and low groups also did not show any significance.  \n\nHypothesis 2b was not supported. High involvement VCs did not attach more importance to making introductions to potential customers, suppliers, and service providers. Hypotheses H2c, 2d, 2e, and 2f were all supported. High involvement VCs attached more importance to seeking additional financing, recruiting management, assisting with operational planning, and serving as the entrepreneur's confidant.  \n\n## Fund Size  \n\nHypothesis 3a was supported (Table 3). The minimum investment of the large funds was 3.7 times greater than that of the small firms’ minimum. The large funds’ maximum investment was 7 times greater than that of the small firms.  \n\nHypotheses 3b and 3c were supported. Large funds were not as interested as small funds in seed investments and were more interested in LBOs. There were no differences for first-stage investments.  \n\n## Geographical Differences  \n\nHypothesis 4a was not supported (Table 4). There were no differences between regions in the proportion of investments where VCs served as lead investors.  \n\nHypothesis $^{46}$ was supported. There were significant differences by region in the percentage of investments in seed, first round, and LBO financings.  \n\nHypothesis $_{4\\mathrm{c}}$ was partially supported. Although Silicon Valley VCs attached more importance to making introductions to potential customers and suppliers, they did not differ from the other regions on introductions to service providers.  \n\n# DISCUSSION  \n\n## Venture Stage  \n\nThere were four identifiable groups of VC firms based on investment stage. One group made almost $65\\%$ of its investments in the seed stage. Another, larger group also focused on early-stage investments but were much less involved in the seed stage. Both of these groups ignored late-stage investments. A third group ignored early stage investments to focus on late-stage investments. The fourth group was interested in investments at all stages.  \n\nTABLE 4 Geographic Region   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>MA</td><td>IL, MN, MI</td><td>Palo Alto, Menlo</td><td>Northerm California</td><td>New</td><td>Southern California</td><td>Texas</td><td>Test Results</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\">PercentageofInvestments</td></tr><tr><td>where Lead</td><td>62.79</td><td>47.50</td><td>54.40</td><td>47.50</td><td>68.76</td><td>59.21</td><td>58.86</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"9\">Percentage of Investments in:</td></tr><tr><td>1.Seed Stage</td><td>25.67</td><td>11.66</td><td>33.89</td><td>16.78</td><td>9.51</td><td>18.67</td><td>7.56</td><td>b</td></tr><tr><td>2.

Although the mean fund size was highest for the mixed-stage investor group, the size of an individual investment was much greater for the later stage group.  \n\nThe earliest stage investors reported being lead investor $69\\%$ of the time. In subsequent stages, there is more of a tendency to follow investors who had invested at the earliest stage. Financing at the LBO stage generally creates a totally different set of investors, making late-stage investors more likely to be lead. (The high response to this question throughout indicates that for one particular investment, more than one VC firm will view itself as the lead investor.)  \n\nThe earliest stage investor spends much less time (88.80 hours) evaluating a proposal than does a late stage investor (339.77 hours). Because the late-stage investment has more of a history,for both the investee and the industry, there is more information available for the investortoevaluate.  \n\nConsistent with prior research, this study found that earlier stage investors are interested in unique, proprietary products with high growth potential, whereas late-stage investors demand a market-proven product. Whereas all VCs want high quality management, earlier stage VCs expect more problems with management, as indicated in the high importance they attach to evaluating management after an investment is made.  \n\nThe earlier the stage, the greater the return potential. However the differences by stage inhurdlerates of return-- $42.20\\%$ forearliestversus $33.52\\%$ for late--were not nearly as great as anticipated. Although the hurdle rates for investors focusing on late-stage investments were similar to those found by Ruhnka and Young (1987) and Plummer (1987), the rates for earliest stage VCs were much lower. There are two explanations for this difference. First, we grouped firms by the composition of their portfolio. Although our earliest stage investors had a large percentage of their investments at the seed stage, they also had investments at later stages as well, which would reduce the average hurdle rate of return for their porfolio. Second, due to the poor performance many VC-backed start-ups experienced in the period between the earlier studies and this study, VCs’ expectations for returns from early-stage investments may have declined (Fried, Hisrich, and Polonchek, 1993).  \n\nThe amount of time spent with a firm after investment did not vary by stage. Although contrary to the findings of Gomez-Mejia et al. (1990), our findings from a much larger sample are consistent with those of MacMillan et al. (1988) and Sapienza (1992). There are, however, major differences in the significance VCs attach to their post-investment activities. Our findings here, coupled with the earlier research, give a clear picture of these differences. Earlier stage investors think that all their activities are important. The lowest score for any activity was a 3.0, which represented the midpoint between extremely important (5.0) and not important (1.o).  \n\nLate-stage investors viewed some activities, such as making introductions to potential customers, as unimportant. Some other activities were viewed as important to late-stage investors, but not to the same degree as for earlier stage investors. For example, recruiting management was rated 3.24 by late-stage investors, indicating that they attached some importance to this activity, but rated 4.5 by seed investors. Some activities, such as assisting with strategic planning, evaluating management, and managing the investor group were seen as quite important at all stages.  \n\n## Assistance Provided by the Venture Capitalist  \n\nThere are major differences in the level of assistance VC firms provide. The high assistance group reported spending an average of 35.65 hours per month with investees when serving as lead investors. This dropped to 12.75 hours for the middle group and 6.76 hours for the low assistance group. In responding to the open-ended question, VCs specifically mentioned time spent with investees as a major area of difference. Three levels of assistance were suggested: inactive (\"just attends board meetings\"), active advice-giver, and hands-on. This is quite similar to the three clusters found by MacMillan et al. (1988)—laissez faire, moderate, and closetracker.  \n\nThese differences are not primarily stage-related. There are high involvement VCs investing in LBOs and low involvement VCs investing at the seed stage. Our findings support MacMillan's position that differences in level of involvement are largely a matter of VC choice.  \n\nNot surprisingly, the more time a VC spends with a company, the more important the VC regards the various post-investment activities. This was particularly true of assisting with operational planning. It should be remembered that the data were gathered from the point of view of the VC, not management. Thus it is not known whether the managers view the high involvement VCs as being very helpful or constantly in the way.  \n\nResponses to the open-ended questions suggested that there are major differences in the amount of time spent on deals that were \"losers\" or \"going sideways.\" Some VCs spend a lot of time trying to improve these deals, whereas others do not. In addition, some VCs tend to quickly fire managers in these circumstances, whereas others become heavily involved working with existing management.  \n\n### Firm Size  \n\nFirms vary greatly in the amount of assets under management. There are also differences in the number of professionals (partners and associates) working at the VC firm, but these differences are of a much lesser magnitude. This results in the amount of money invested per professional increasing as fund size increases-from 3.21 to 10.84 to 29.77 million dollars per professional. Not surprisingly, the size of individual investments increases significantly with size. The big firms also spend less time providing assistance after the investment is made.  \n\nHow do the larger firms invest more yet spend less time with investees? As Bygrave and Timmons (1992) suggest, part of the answer may lie in the fact that they are less interested in seed stageinvestments( $11.35\\%$ forlargeversus $26.26\\%$ for small) and more interested in LBOs $(21.22\\%$ forlargeversus $10.15\\%$ for small). Although this may provide part of the answer, the differences in time spent were greater for firm size than they were when the firms were split by investment stage. In addition, many of the differences between early- and late-stage investors discussed earlier, such as market acceptance of product, do not hold for firm size.  \n\nThere are large firms making seed investments and small firms investing in LBOs. Large funds had $11.35\\%$ of their investments in seed stage. Although significantly less in percentage terms than small funds, the absolute amount of seed investment by the large firms was greater. In addition, there were no differences by firm size in the percentage of portfolio invested in the first round. Thus differences in stages of interest do not fully explain the different behavior of largeVC firms.  \n\nThe middle-sized firms spent the most time providing assistance to investees. As previously discussed, large firms appear to have made a strategic decision to provide less management assistance. Small firms may be providing less assistance because they do not have enough funds under management to reach minimum efficient scale.The existence of some scale economies in venture capital is also supported by the fact that the time between initial contact by an investee and ultimate investment by the VC firm decreases as firm size increases.  \n\nTwo other interesting results emerged. First, large firms were the least concerned about having the ability to quickly exit an investment. This is inconsistent with the large firms' emphasis on LBOs because the late-stage investor group was most concerned about quick exit. Second, the medium-sized funds had a higher hurdle rate than the other groups.  \n\n### Geographic Regions  \n\nConsistent with earlier research, we found major differences in investment stages of interest. New York has minimal involvement at seed stage, whereas Massachusetts and Silicon Valley put a quarter to a third of their investments in this stage. New York is heavily involved in LBOs, whereas Massachusetts, Silicon Valley, and Northern California are not. Given the finance orientation of New York, this was expected. Interestingly, Texans are the least interested in seed investing, yet are quite active in first-round investing and net importers of venture capital. At the same time they are also interested in leveraged buyouts, even though the average VC firm is relatively small.  \n\nThese differences by region in investment stage of interest lead to a variety of other differences between the regions. For example, New York with its late-stage orientation places the most importance on market acceptance. In addition, this study supports the view of Florida and Kenney (1988a, 1988b) and Fried and Hisrich (1991) that there are differences between geographic regions that cannot be explained by differing investment stage. For example, Southern and Northern CaliforniaVC firms are similar to each other in terms of size and investment stage. However, the Southern California VCs are more demanding of the entrepreneur and product when evaluating an investment. The Southern California VCs also reported spending twice as much time providing post-investment assistance. The nature and causeof thesedifferences areunclear.  \n\nHow important is a local venture capital industry to regional economic development? Because New York and Chicago are clearly major exporters of venture capital to the rest of the United States, why is a local venture capital industry necessary? In Florida and Kenney's view, a local industry is vital since New York and Chicago VCs invest out of region in deals led by local VCs. However this study, combined with Gupta and Sapienza, presents a slightly different view.  \n\nThere appear to be three different types of venture capital markets. First is the market for early-stage capital, which functions much as described by Florida and Kenney. VCs invest in deals in their area. Investment is also made out of area, but only with a local VC as lead. Second is the market for smal, late-stage investments. This is basically a local market. Finally, there is the market for large, late-stage investments, which is a national market.  \n\nThus having local VCs is vital if a region is to provide either early-stage or small, late-stage financing but not large, late-stage financing. VCs making large investments can spread the fixed transaction costs of travel and VC travel time over a larger investment. In addition, late-stage VCs are not as dependent upon tight networks as are early-stage VCs.  \n\n# FUTURE RESEARCH  \n\nThis study points to several interesting questions that future research should address. We found that many VCs make investments at early stages yet do not provide a high level of assistance to these ventures. Existing theory suggests that this is a recipe for poor performance. What is the actual performance of these early-stage, low involvement firms? If these VCs are successful, how do they manage the relationship differently than the more involved early-stageVC?  \n\nCurrently the only explanation of differences by firm size is that large firms invest at later stages. However, we found that many large firms invest at early stages. In addition, there were differences independent of investment stage of interest. The nature and source of differences by size needs to be further examined.  \n\nNot surprisingly we found that high involvement VCs attached more importance to their post-investment activities. The value of a high level of VC involvement needs to be examined from the point of view of managers. In addition, the impact on performance from high VC involvement should be examined.  \n\nWe also found major differences in how VCs deal with problems at their portfolio firms. This issue has never been formally researched. The behavior of a VC in times of trouble has profound implications for the portfolio company and its management. Many VCs feel that it also has a significant impact on their overall fund performance.  \n\nRegional differences also merit further investigation. There are regional differences that cannot be explained by investment stage of interest. To the extent these differences are culturally driven, qualitative research is likely necessary.  \n\nThis study only looked at venture capital in the United States. Yet the venture capital industry outside the United States has grown explosively in recent years and is now larger than the U.s. industry. Although the subject of much less research than the U.S. industry, there appear to be differences by geographic region throughout the world (Bygrave and Timmons1992).  \n\nIn addition to the four areas we examined, there are other interesting differences that were not tested in this study. Several responses were received to the open-ended question asking how VC firms differ. More than one VC mentioned each of the following: whether the VC tries to be a partner or an adversary of management, whether or not the VC firm will invest when the management team is incomplete, whether or not the VC firm plans to exit the investment via an initial public offering or acquisition, whether or not the VC firm is an SBIC and limited by government regulation, and whether or not the partners in the VC firm have experience as managers of an operating company.  \n\nFrequency of co-investing with other VCs (Bygrave 1987) was mentioned several times. Other research suggests that an important factor is whether or not the VC serves as lead investor (Gorman and Sahlman 1989). The two are related. If a firm invests by itself, it is automatically a lead investor. Thus there could be three types of VCs: those who invest by themselves, those who co-invest with other VCs and are often the lead investor, and those who co-invest and generally follow other VCs. Although responses of VCs to the open-ended question were supportive of this classification system, it is interesting to note that few VCs view themselves as followers.  \n\nSeveral responses pointed to differences in level of industry specialization. Some firms focus on specific industries, whereas others do not. Although not tested in the present study. this appears to be a significant factor (Bygrave and Timmons 1992).  \n\nAnother difference suggested was the manner in which firms generate potential investments. Although most rely on referral networks, an increasing number of firms are actively creating investment opportunities (Fried and Hisrich 1994; Robinson 1987).  \n\nThe overall goal of firms may also differ. Most VCs manage money for traditional investors seeking direct monetary returns on investment. However, some of the VC firms indicated that they were different because they were “strategic investors.\" These firms are managing money provided by operating companies in furtherance of a particular strategic goal, such as having a window on new technology. (See Hurry, Miller, and Bowman 1992, for a discussion of venture capital investing as a means to purchase a shadow option.) This difference in overall purpose may lead to other differences in behavior.  \n\nFinally, several VCs indicated that there were major differences in the ability of the VC firm to add value after the investment was made through such things as the VC's contacts and business knowledge. Although this concept is similar to amount of assistance provided, it focuses more on the quality of assistance rather than quantity. This result corroborates Rosenstein et al.'s (1993) finding that managers valued the assistance provided by \"Top $20^{\\cdot}\\mathrm{~\\r~}$ VCs more highly than the assistance provided by \"average\" VCs. In other words, all venture capitalists are not created equal.  \n\n# REFERENCES  \n\nBarney, J.B., Busenitz, L., and Fiet, J.O. 1989.
