McLaughlin, Hunter College and City University of New York  \n\nMark Bils, University of Rochester and National Bureau of EconomicResearch  \n\nWe investigate whether a market-clearing model is consistent with industry employment and wage patterns related to the cyclical upgrading of labor. We demonstrate that Roy's (1951) market-clearing model of self-selection would account for cyclical upgrading if industries were characterized by positive selection. Wage comparisons of industry movers and stayers in panel data do reveal widespread positive selection. Also consistent with the Roy model, compositioncorrected industry wages are more cyclical in high-wage cyclical industries. The Roy model does fail to explain predictable patterns in the wage changes of industry movers, so we consider several marketclearing and queuing extensions.  \n\nFor helpful comments, we thank Chris Ferrall, Larry Katz, Barbara Mace, Kevin M.

Introduction  \n\nAggregate expansions are associated with upgrading in the labor market (Reder 1955; Okun 1973). In expansions, workers tend to flow from low-wage industries, such as retail trade, to high-wage industries, such as durable-goods manufacturing. Indeed, employment in higher-wage industries is more cyclical than employment in lower-wage industries (Okun 1973; Vroman 1977; Huizinga 1980). In addition, relative to the aggregate wage, wages do not rise in high-wage cyclical industries in expansions; that is, industry wage differentials fail to widen as the economy expands (Haddy and Tolles 1957; Wachter 1970; Hall 1975; Wood and Solon 1990).  \n\nThe evidence that employment is most cyclical in high-wage industries and wages most cyclical in low-wage industries has been cited to support disequilibrium or segmented markets theories of the labor market. First, the evidence appears to be inconsistent with a market-clearing equilibrium with high-wage cyclical industries exhibiting relatively large product demand increases in expansions: if the labor market clears, Why would industries with large fluctuations in employment not have large fluctuations in wages? Second, as Okun (1973) stresses, if employers in highwage industries face queues of workers, then the industry need not increase its wage to expand employment: the upward slope of labor supply is irrelevant. Queues stabilize wages in high-wage industries but exacerbate movements in employment. McDonald and Solow (1985) draw essentially the same implications from a model where union bargaining in some industries is the source of industry wage effects and worker queues. Others draw similar conclusions from models that employ efficiency wages to create industry wage differences and queues (e.g.. Akerlof and Yellen 1985).  \n\nThe evidence of cyclical upgrading is not sufficient to support the conclusion of segmented labor markets. Market clearing does not require large movements in relative wages. First, if over the cycle interindustry movers are low-skill workers, then their transitions to high-wage industries tend to bias down the wage growth in those industries. This effect is purely compositional. Second, if high-wage industries face more elastic labor supply schedules, then smaller-wage changes could support larger flows of labor into and out from these industries.  \n\nOne of our purposes is to demonstrate that cyclical upgrading is consistent with a market-clearing equilibrium. A second purpose is to determine whether a market-clearing model can simultaneously account for other patterns of interindustry mobility. To balance the analysis, we also apply a simple queuing model to interindustry mobility.  \n\nAfter briefly documenting the industry employment and wage patterns, we specify a market-clearing model of industry selection that explains cyclical upgrading. Heterogeneous workers follow comparative advantage in self-selecting into industries (Roy 1951). We characterize the distribution of skills that would produce cyclical upgrading through purely compositional effects. We contrast the predictions of the marketclearing model with predictions of a queuing model of the labor market, one in which firms pay effciency wages to attract higher quality applicants (e.g., Weiss 1980).  \n\nWe use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate the Roy model for 22 industries. Use of panel data enables us to identify the selection process qualitatively, without limiting the number of industries or imposing distributional assumptions as in Heckman and Sedlacek (1985, 1990). By comparing the wages of interindustry movers with wages of their coworkers before and after the move, we find that comparative advantage lines up with absolute advantage in almost every industry: each industry employs workers who are better in that industry than other workers would be. We show that this selection process is consistent with cyclical upgrading.  \n\nOur evidence of heterogeneity and comparative advantage suggests that industries face rising labor-supply schedules, so increases in industry employment require increases in industry wage rates. Our analysis of composition-corrected wages (i.e., our estimates of true industry wage rates) confirms this analysis. Although labor supply appears to be more elastic in high-wage cyclical industries, these industries have the largest increases in composition-corrected wages in cyclical expansions.  \n\nThe Roy model, however, fails to explain the wage changes of interindustry movers: wages jump up (down) for entrants to (leavers from) high-wage industries. Such jumps are consistent with queuing for jobs in high-wage industries or compensating wage differentials for unobserved industry attributes. A test of the power of premove wages in predicting postmove wages of interindustry movers does not support the queuing model.  \n\n### I1. Industry Employment and Wage Patterns  \n\nIn this section, we document the primary industry patterns for employment and wages for the United States. Which industries exhibit the biggest employment fluctuations and which have the biggest wage fluctuations? Do high-wage industries fluctuate the most in terms of employment but the least in terms of wages? Overall, does cyclical upgrading characterize industries in the United States?  \n\nTo answer these questions, we analyze annual data on employment and hourly wages in 22 industries from 1964 through 1995 from Bureau of  \n\nLabor Statistics (BLS) surveys of establishments.1 The first two columns of table 1 display summary characteristics—averages over the sample period-- of industry employment and wages for our 22 industries. Column 1 lists each industry's share of aggregate employment. Column 2 reports average hourly wages of production workers in each industry relative to average hourly wages in all private nonagricultural industries. Mining; Construction; Transportation; Communications & Utilities; and most manufacturing industries pay relatively high wages. The low-wage industries are Agriculture; Textiles, Apparel & Leather; Retail Trade; and Personal Services.  \n\nTo estimate the cyclical sensitivities of industry i's employment $E_{i t}$ and wages $\\mathbb{W}_{i t},$ we regress each industry variable on aggregate employment $E_{t},$ our measure of the business cycle. In particular, let  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\ln(E_{i t}/E_{t})=a_{i}^{e}+\\alpha_{i}^{e}t+\\beta_{i}^{e}\\ln E_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}^{e}}\\ {\\ln(W_{i t}/W_{t})=a_{i}^{w}+\\alpha_{i}^{w}t+\\beta_{i}^{w}\\ln E_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i t}^{w},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the variables without industry indices are aggregates. These equations are first differenced and estimated separately for each industry.2 We report our estimates of the cyclical sensitivities, $\\upbeta_{i}^{e}$ and $\\upbeta_{i\\mathrm{~.~}}^{w}$ in the last two columns of table 1.  \n\nBased on the industry employment elasticities reported in column 3, industries vary dramatically in their cyclical sensitivities of employment. (Since our measure of the business cycle is aggregate employment, an industry with a constant share of aggregate employment over the business cycle receives a value of zero.) Employment fluctuations in Construction and all durable manufacturing industries are more than twice the size of the aggregate employment fluctuations. Agriculture; Food & Tobacco; Communication & Utilities; Public Administration, and several service industries exhibit cyclical movements in employment that are less than half the size of the aggregate movements.  \n\nReflecting the cyclical upgrading of labor across industries, the cyclical sensitivities of industry employment are positively correlated with industry wages. The correlation between industry relative wages in column 2 and the industry employment elasticities in column 3 is .55. High-wage industries are more cyclical.3  \n\nTable1 Cyclical Patterns across Industries\\* (Establishment Data, 1964-95)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Industry</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Employment</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Relative Wages</td><td colspan=\"2\">Elasticity of Relativet</td></tr><tr><td>Employment</td><td>Wages</td></tr><tr><td>Agriculturet</td><td>4.0</td><td>.55</td><td>-1.06</td><td>.89</td></tr><tr><td>Mining</td><td>.8</td><td>1.32</td><td>(.34) -.56</td><td>(.30) -.20</td></tr><tr><td>Construction</td><td>4.6</td><td>1.51</td><td>(.71) 1.67</td><td>(.17) -.14</td></tr><tr><td>Metals</td><td>2.9</td><td>1.22</td><td>(.28) 1.76</td><td>(.14) -.04</td></tr><tr><td>Machinery</td><td>4.2</td><td>1.15</td><td>(.22) 1.74</td><td>(.13) -.23</td></tr><tr><td>Transportation Equipment</td><td>2.1</td><td>1.39</td><td>(.27) 1.73</td><td>(.19) -.15</td></tr><tr><td>Other Durables</td><td>3.5</td><td>.97</td><td>(.33) 1.21</td><td>(.13) .004</td></tr><tr><td>Food & Tobacco</td><td></td><td>1.01</td><td>(.20) -.65</td><td>(.12) -.20</td></tr><tr><td>Textiles, Apparel, & Leather</td><td>2.0</td><td>.74</td><td>(.10) .33</td><td>(.09) .13</td></tr><tr><td>Paper, Printing, & Publishing</td><td>2.7</td><td>1.17</td><td>(.27) .03</td><td>(.11) -.16</td></tr><tr><td>Chemicals, Petroleum,& Rubber</td><td>2.2</td><td>1.17</td><td>(.11) .48</td><td>(.05) -.38</td></tr><tr><td>Transportationt</td><td>2.2</td><td>1.21</td><td>(.16) .35</td><td>(.08) .15</td></tr><tr><td>Communications &Utilitiest</td><td>3.3</td><td>1.37</td><td>(.15) -.67</td><td>(.17) -.10</td></tr><tr><td>Wholesale Trade</td><td>2.2</td><td></td><td>(.22) -.01</td><td>(.16) -.05</td></tr><tr><td>Retail Trade</td><td>5.5</td><td>1.07</td><td>(.10) -.11</td><td>(.08) \".10</td></tr><tr><td>Finance, Insurance, & Real Estate</td><td>16.1</td><td>.73</td><td>(.10) .39</td><td>(.09) -.21</td></tr><tr><td>Business & Repair ServicestS</td><td>5.4</td><td>.95</td><td>(.16)</td><td>(.14) -.10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>4.4</td><td>.90</td><td>.55 (.17)</td><td>(.25)</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Servicest</td><td>2.2</td><td>.66</td><td>.33 (.17)</td><td>.11 (.17)</td></tr><tr><td>Health Services</td><td>5.5</td><td>.95</td><td>-1.00 (.19)</td><td>-.37 (.11)</td></tr><tr><td>Educationt</td><td>8.2</td><td>.92</td><td>-.59 (.19)</td><td>-.08 (.27)</td></tr><tr><td>Other Professional ServicesS</td><td>3.6</td><td>.89</td><td>-.63 (.18)</td><td>.27 (.23)</td></tr><tr><td>Public Administrationt</td><td>9.8</td><td>1.12</td><td>-.53 (.17)</td><td>-.16 (.12)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\\* Standard errors are displayed in parentheses. Industries not elsewhere classified account for $2.6\\%$ of employment. $^\\dagger$ These industry elasticities are measured relative to movements in aggregate employment and wages. The elasticity of aggregate real wages with respect to aggregate employment equals 0.28 (0.11). Bureau of Labor Statistics establishment data are not available for wage rates for these industries. The relative industry wages and wage elasticities are based on compensation data from the National Income andProductAccounts. $\\S$ For these industries, data are available for only 1972-95.  \n\nBecause expansions are associated with faster employment growth in high-wage industries, aggregate wages vary procyclically relative to a weighted average of industry wages, but this compositional effect is quite weak. Column 4 presents the estimated cyclical sensitivities of industry wages relative to aggregate wages in the private nonagricultural economy. The employment-weighted average of these industry relative wage elasticities is $\\mathtt{-.05}$ . In response to a $1\\%$ increase in aggregate employment, aggregate wages increase by $0.28\\%$ (.11), of which only $05\\%$ is attributable to the compositional effect.  \n\nThere is also strong evidence against high-wage and cyclical industries having the most cyclical wages. Indeed, wages in these industries tend to be less procyclical. First, the cyclical sensitivity of industry wages (or industry wage elasticity) is negatively correlated with the level of industry wages: the correlation between industry wage elasticities in column 4 and industry wages in column 2 is -.53. Second, industries with the most procyclical employments actually have slightly less procyclical wages: the correlation between the industry wage and employment elasticities is -.16.4 These correlations confirm the previous evidence that industry wage differentials narrow in expansions (Haddy and Tolles 1957; Wachter 1970; Hall 1975) or at least fail to widen (Wood and Solon 1990).  \n\nOverall, establishment data confirm the following patterns of cyclical upgrading: $(a)$ high-wage industries are strongly cyclical and $(b)$ wagesare less procyclical in high-wage industries, and wages are not more procyclical in cyclical industries. Our analysis of the establishment data also uncovers a new industry pattern: (c) industry wages tend to be only slightly countercyclical relative to aggregate wages.  \n\n### II1. Economic Hypotheses  \n\nThese industry employment and wage patterns are consistent with both segmented-market and market-clearing approaches to the labor market. With a segmented labor market, the source of the regularities is queues for jobs in high-wage industries. Employment in high-wage industries fluctuates more because firms in these industries draw from the queue without raising wages. Hence industries with high wages and large employment fluctuations are predicted to have small wage fluctuations. Since workers drawn from the queue receive jumps in pay, aggregate wages would be procyclical even if industry wages were acyclical, which means industry wages would be countercyclical relative to the aggregate wage. Thus, the industry employment and wage patterns are consistent with segmented labor markets, although the evidence of countercyclical industry relative wages is weak.  \n\nWith heterogeneous workers and market clearing, self-selection can also produce the industry employment and wage patterns. Suppose interindustry movers tend to be below average in the skill distribution both where they come from and where they go to. If high-wage industries are the most cyclical, then a cyclical expansion would draw the least-talented workers from low-wage industries, and these workers would become the least-talented workers in the high-wage industries. This compositional bias lowers average wages in the expanding high-wage industries and raises average wages in the contracting low-wage industries. Consequently, industry wage elasticities would be negatively correlated with industry wages; industry wage elasticities would also be negatively correlated with industry employment elasticities if individual wages were not bid up too much in the cyclical industries. Since some industry wage elasticities would contain procyclical biases and others countercyclical biases, a strong countercyclical bias for industry relative wages would not be implied. This is consistent with the weakness of pattern c.  \n\nTo be more precise in sorting among the competing hypotheses, we sketch a market-clearing model of selection. The model is tightly specified, so we also consider relaxing some of its restrictions (i.e., spot markets, wage-income maximization, a time-invariant distribution of skills) while preserving the key feature of market clearing. We also investigate whether any inadequacies of the model can be remedied by introducing queues.  \n\n#### A. Roy's Model of Self-Selection  \n\nWe use Roy's (1951) equilibrium model of self-selection in the labor market to analyze the effects of aggregate fluctuations that shift industry demands for labor. Shifts in industry labor demands generate changes in the composition of employment, production, and consumption that are supported by changes in industry wage rates and product prices. The induced reallocation of labor produces compositional effects that are potentially consistent with the industry wage and employment patterns.  \n\nWe begin by summarizing the essential features of the selection model (see Sattinger's 1993 survey for details). There are $n~+~1$ industries indexed by $i=0,\\ldots,n$ . Industry O is the nonmarket or home sector, which we treat the same as any industry in the market. Each industry faces a downward-sloping demand for its product. Each industry's output is an increasing concave function of its labor input $L_{i t}\\colon q_{i t}=F_{i t}(L_{i t})$ There is a large number of identical firms within each industry. Taking industry product prices $\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\mathbf{p}_{t}}&{=}&{(p_{1t},\\dots,~p_{n t})}\\end{array}$ and wage rates $\\mathbf{6}\\mathbf{0}_{t}$ $\\mathbf{\\Psi}=(\\upomega_{1t},\\dots,\\upomega_{n t})$ as given, firms behave competitively in both product and labor markets. From competition, industry employment satisfies $\\phi_{i t}F_{i t}^{\\prime}=\\omega_{i t}.$  \n\nThere is a large number of heterogeneous individuals. Skills vary across workers, and these skills are valued differently in different industries. If employed in industry $i,$ an individual worker generates $x_{i}$ units of labor input. (So $L_{i}$ aggregates the $x_{i}$ over workers employed in industry i.) At time $t_{:}$ the wages (or wage income) of a worker in industry $i$ is the product of the industry wage rate $\\omega_{i t}$ and the worker's labor input $x_{i}\\colon W_{i t}\\equiv\\omega_{i t}x_{i}.$ Individuals choose where to work by comparing wages across industries. We indicate the choice by an industry variable $I_{t},$ which equals $i$ if the individual works in industry i.  \n\nIn the competitive equilibrium, product prices $\\mathbf{p}_{t}^{*}=(p_{1t}^{*},\\ldots,p_{n t}^{*})$ cleartheproduct market wagerates $\\mathbf{\\omega}^{::}_{t}=\\big(\\tilde{\\omega}_{1t}^{::},~.~.~.~,\\tilde{\\omega}_{n t}^{::}\\big)$ clearthelabor market, and workers follow comparative advantage in self-selecting across industries. (Given heterogeneity, wage rates need not equalize across industries.) If comparative advantage lines up with absolute advantage, each industry employs workers who are better than average in that industry. Alternatively, each industry might specialize in a quality of labor, with industries naturally ordered from least to most selective.  \n\nThe case of two unordered industries is illustrated in figure 1. With each worker described by a point on the graph, the iso-probability contours reflect the population distribution of skills. Wage income would be equalized across the two industries for workers “located\" along the ray from the origin. So the ray with slope ${\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}_{1t}/{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}_{2t}$ is the reservation wage line. Workers below the reservation wage line sort into industry 1; those above choose industry 2. As drawn, each industry attracts workers who are better in that industry than other workers would be, so comparative advantage aligns with absolute advantage. Because each industry attracts workers from the top of its marginal distribution, each industry is characterized by “positive selection.\"  \n\nAggregate fluctuations—through technology shocks or product demand shocks-- generate shifts in industry labor demands. In a cyclical expansion, the nonmarket sector declines, some industries grow faster than others, industry wage rates fluctuate, and workers re-sort across industries.5 Consistent with simple economic principles, industry employment and wage fluctuations depend on the size of the shift in industry labor demand and the labor supply elasticity.6  \n\n![](images/a77366c26d11d5d11a669677b455b11676c9dbab45539a20cddd21cdc1372c55.jpg)  \nFIG. 1.— Industry selection in the Roy model  \n\n5 Bils and Klenow (1998) show that even a common agregate shock would generate sizable interindustry shifts in production toward durables and luxuries in an expansion. To achieve a given increase in the stock and consumption of a good requires a dramatically greater increase in production for a durable good. In fact, much of the cross-industry differences in cyclical sensitivity of employment is captured by the five industries that produce durable goods: Construction; Metals; Machinery; Transportation Equipment; and Other Durables. See table 1.  \n\n6 For instance, if industry labor supply curves have different slopes, workers re-sort across industries in response to a technology shock that increases the marginal product of labor $k$ percent in all industries. An industry with elastic labor supply can draw from many marginal workers willing to work in the industry for only a small increase in the industry wage rate. Employment in such an industry grows with little increase in the industry wage rate. An industry with few marginal workers grows little, but the industry wage rate must rise to attract  \n\nThis model is consistent with cyclical upgrading if industries are characterized by positive selection. Begin by assuming, as in figure 1, that industries are not ordered. Two of the many industries are construction, with high wages and cyclical employment, and retail trade, with low wages and less cyclical employment. Consider a cyclical expansion that increases all the industry wage rates $\\omega_{t},$ with employment in construction growing more than employment in retail trade. Among the many interindustry flows, some workers flow from retail trade to construction. (This requires the wage rate in construction to rise relative to the wage rate in retail trade.) The new hires in construction tend to dilute the average quality of construction workers, which attenuates the wage increase in construction. These low-quality new hires in construction were low-quality retailers. As its worst workers leave, retail trade's average quality of labor rises, which accentuates average wage growth in retailing. Each selection bias works against the change in the true industry wage rate; combined, they bias industry relative wages from moving more in high-wage and cyclical industries. (See app. A for details.) Furthermore, as suggested by the mix of positive and negative biases in industry wage responses, interindustry mobility does not contribute a simple bias to aggregate wages, an employment-weighted average of the industry wages.  \n\nHowever, the ability of the Roy model to account for cyclical upgrading hinges on the assumption that industries are not ordered. For instance, if low-wage industries were characterized by negative selection, which would occur if the probability contours in figure 1 were positively sloped and flatter than the reservation wage line, self-selection would not generate all the cyclical upgrading patterns. In an expansion, the best workers even these few extra workers. Consequently, an aggregate expansion that is neutral in terms of industry labor demands shifts employment toward industries with elastic labor supplies.  \n\n7 The wages of stayers in each industry grow at the same rate as the industry's wage rate. Revealed preference implies that the wages of an interindustry mover grow at least as fast as the wage rate grows in the industry he leaves. Therefore, self-selection across industries in expansions accentuates the upward force on aggregate wages. However, self-selection attenuates the downward force on aggregate wages in contractions: mobile workers escape from industries with the deepest wage cuts. Overall, aggregate wages reflect a procyclical bias in expansions and a countercyclical bias in contractions as a result of interindustry mobility. This asymmetry could be misinterpreted as a downward rigidity of wages. This contrasts with Heckman and Sedlacek's (1985, pp. 1107-10) conclusion that self-selection across sectors within the labor market reinforces the variability of aggregate wages. If their simulations of the Roy model are correct, self-selection based on nonwage atributes —- rather than self-selection across sectors—must account for their results. We consider this below.  \n\nfrom low-wage industries would become the worst workers in high-wage industries. As a result, selection effects would bias each industry's average wage down, so industry relative wages would all be countercyclical. (See app. A for details.) This is not consistent with the evidence summarized by pattern c. Nor does this specification of the Roy model predict pattern $b.$ : since wages in low-wage industries are also biased down in this case, nothing points to wages in high-wage cyclical industries being less procyclical.  \n\nIs there evidence regarding the selection process and the ordering of industries? Does the model yield strong testable predictions? By comparing the wages and wage changes of industry stayers and interindustry movers in panel data, we can determine whether the estimated selection process is consistent with cyclical upgrading and search for violations of the model's restrictions.  \n\n#### B. Empirical Specification  \n\nIn this subsection, we present our methods for using panel data to address these issues. We have three methods. The first method compares the wages of industry stayers and interindustry movers; the second computes the wage changes of industry stayers; and the third compares the wage changes of industry stayers and interindustry movers.  \n\nFollowing the long tradition in labor economics, we analyze log wages. An industry's offer of wages (in logs) is the sum of its shadow price of labor (in logs), the industry's population mean of labor input, and a random variable.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\ln W_{i t}=\\ln\\upomega_{i t}^{*}+\\ln x_{i}}&{{}}\\ {=\\ln\\upomega_{i t}^{*}+\\upmu_{i}+\\upvarepsilon_{i}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the random vector $\\ln\\textbf{x}=(\\ln x_{0},\\ldots,\\ln x_{n})$ has mean $\\upmu$ $\\mathbf{\\mu}=(\\upmu_{0},\\ldots,\\upmu_{n})$ and covariance matrix $\\pmb{\\Sigma}$ . Since the distribution of labor inputs is not indexed by time $t$ , industry-wide fluctuations and trends in skills (through $\\upmu_{i t},$ are absorbed into the shadow prices $\\{\\cup_{i t}^{*}$  \n\nOur first method compares the wages of industry stayers with the wages of interindustry movers. By positioning movers in the distributions of wages in their source and target industries, we can determine whether each industry is characterized by positive or negative selection.  \n\nSuppose a worker moves from source industry $\\textit{i}$ to target industry j. By comparing his wages before he left industry $i$ with the average wages of those who stayed in industry i, we determine whether the leaver was below or above average in industry i. If leavers were below average, industry i exhibits positive selection: it retains its best workers as the worst workers leave. (Steepening the ray in fig. 1 would produce this result.) If leavers were above average, industry $i$ exhibits negative selection: its best workers are the first to go. So the sign of the following wage comparison qualitatively identifies selection in source industry $i$  \n\n$$\nW_{i t}^{s}-W_{i t}^{l}\\gtrless0,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathrm{W}_{i t}^{s}$ and $\\mathbb{W}_{i t}^{l}$ denote average log wages at time $t$ of industry ${{i}^{\\prime}}s$ stayers $s$ (i.e., those who will remain in industry $i$ attime $t+1$ ) and leavers $l$ (i.e., those who will be employed in another industry at time $t$ $^{+1},$  \n\nBy comparing the mover's wages in industry $j$ with average wages of workers who stay in industry $j,$ we establish whether the entrant is below or above average in his target industry. If entrants are below average, then industry $j$ exhibits positive selection. If entrants are above average, then industry $j$ exhibits negative selection. So the sign of the following wage comparison qualitatively identifies selection in target industry $j$  \n\n$$\nW_{j,t+1}^{s}-W_{j,t+1}^{e}\\gtrless0.\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, if industry $i$ grows (so some workers move to industry $i$ from industry $j$ ), we compute the following wage comparisons:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{W_{i,t+1}^{s}-W_{i,t+1}^{e}\\gtrless0}}\\ {{W_{j t}^{s}-W_{j t}^{l}\\gtrless0,}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the sign of the first expression identifies selection in target industry i and the sign of the second expression, selection in source industry $j$ Therefore, if industries periodically expand and contract, these simple computations of average industry log wages yield two sets of estimates of the selection process for each industry.  \n\nOur second method computes the wage changes of the industry stayers to identify the growth rate of each industry's wage rate. Time differencing the log wages of the industry stayers yields the growth rate of the industry's shadow price of labor.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{W_{i,t+1}^{s}-W_{i t}^{s}=\\ln\\upomega_{i,t+1}^{*}-\\ln\\upomega_{i t}^{*}\\equiv\\gamma_{i t}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis enables us to characterize the evolution of industry wage rates without compositional biases. This follows from the time-invariance of skills. Alternatively, if transitory fluctuations in skills are worker specific, selection effects could bias the wage growth of stayers away from $\\upgamma_{i t}$ (Keane, Moffitt, and Runkle 1988). But this selection bias does not appear to be important empirically.8  \n\nOur third method detects patterns of wage changes that would be inconsistent with the selection model. Self-selection on wage income imposes inequality restrictions on the wage changes of interindustry movers. For illustration, consider movers from source industry $_i$ to target industry $j.$ If the wage growth of movers were less than the wage growth of their former coworkers who remain in industry $i,$ why would the movers choose to move? Would the turnover be involuntary? Likewise, if the wage growth of the entrants to industry $j$ were to exceed the wage growth of the old hires (i.e., target industry stayers), we would wonder why the entrants did not choose to be employed in industry $j$ earlier. Were they prevented from entering industry $j!^{\\circ}$ Is there a queue for jobs in industry j?  \n\nWe formalize these ideas with the following proposition:  \n\nPROPOsITION. If workers sort across industries on the basis of current wages, then the wage growth of movers m from industry $i$ to industry $j$ must be greater than the wage growth of stayers in the movers’ source industry $(i)$ and less than the wage growth of stayers in the movers target industry $(j)$ . That is,  \n\n$$\n\\Delta W_{i}^{s}<\\Delta W_{i j}^{m}<\\Delta W_{j}^{s}.\n$$  \n\nProof. See appendix B.  \n\nArmed with this result, we can search for violations of the inequalities by computing average wage growth within and between each industry pair. The proposition can be tested less formally with a simple regression. In Section V, we regress the wage growth of each interindustry mover on the average wage growth in his source industry, $\\Delta W_{i}^{s},$ and the average wage growth in his target industry, $\\Delta W_{j}^{s}.$ We expect the wage growth of interindustry movers to be increasing in $\\Delta W_{i}^{s}$ and $\\Delta W_{j}^{s}$  \n\nThe Roy model abstracts from important features of labor markets such as compensating wage differentials and career dynamics through skill acquisition and learning of match qualities. By informally extending the Roy model to incorporate these features, we can check the sensitivity of our implications to relaxing these restrictions. We also consider dropping the market-clearing assumption to allow for efficiency wages.  \n\n#### C. Compensating Differentials and Career Dynamics  \n\nAlthough the proposition holds for any number of industries and any distribution of skills, it does contain an important qualification: workers sort across industries in period $t$ on the basis of wage offers in period $t$ If jobs were characterized by attributes, as well as wages, then the restrictions on the growth rates could be violated even though the labor market efficiently allocates workers to industries. If job attributes differ across industries, then a worker who would be indifferent between two industries would not have the same wage offer from the two. The compensating wage differential drives a wedge between the wage offers faced by a marginal worker. Attracting the marginal worker to an industry with low amenities and high wages leads to a jump in his pay. If the marginal worker leaves this industry, his pay jumps down. These jumps can violate the proposition.  \n\nThe proposition could also be violated if industry selection depends on dynamic elements, such as accumulating or learning of industry-specific skills. With career dynamics, future prospects affect the reservation wage for selection into an industry, which drives a wedge between the wage offers faced by a marginal worker.? In this way, future prospects are an industry attribute, and the associated compensating differentials could violate the proposition. For instance, some industries might be fertile ground for acquiring skills but not for rewarding skills. Reservation wages to these stepping-stone industries would be low, and the wage growth of leavers could be excessive, high enough to violate the proposition. But with career dynamics, the industry-dependent values of future prospects vary over a worker's career, vanishing at retirement. If career dynamics were the source of violations of the proposition, violations would be less frequent for older workers.  \n\n#### D. Efficiency Wages  \n\nWe also explore whether any inadequacies of Roy's market-clearing model could be remedied by introducing queues of willing and able workers. A selection-based model of efficiency wages (e.g., Weiss 1980) modifies the Roy model to allow queues. In this efficiency wage model, some skills are unobservable, and firms offer a wage premium to attract workers with these skills.  \n\n![](images/62d02d3ae671f5a3fc6daff9c3a82e07b05d0d4943537188326fd04c28621164.jpg)  \nFIG. 2.— Industry selection in the queuing model  \n\nConsider the case of two industries. In industry 1, the effciency wage industry, the random component of labor quality $\\varepsilon_{1}$ is not observed by firms even after production. Firms in industry 2 accurately measure each worker's labor quality, so wage offers in industry 2 follow equation (2) above. Without knowledge of $\\varepsilon_{1}$ , firms in industry 1 offer  \n\n$$\n\\ln W_{1t}=\\ln\\upomega_{1t}+\\upmu_{1}+\\upeta,\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathfrak{n}$ is the efficiency wage premium. Observable differences in labor quality, reflected in $\\upmu_{1}$ , allow for variation in wages across workers in industry 1.  \n\nA worker applies for employment in industry 1 if his wages there would exceed his wages in industry 2. Because wages in industry 1 do not depend on individual skills, the reservation wage is a horizontal line in figure 2. Workers above the reservation wage line select industry 2; those below the line apply to industry 1. Formally, a worker applies to industry 1 if and only if  \n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{E}_{2}<\\mathfrak{n}+(\\ln\\upomega_{1t}-\\ln\\upomega_{2t})+(\\upmu_{1}-\\upmu_{2}).\n$$  \n\nApplicants to industry 1 tend to have low skills in industry 2, and the average quality of workers in industry 2 increases with the wage premium $\\boldsymbol{\\mathfrak{n}}$ If and only if $\\varepsilon_{1}$ and $\\varepsilon_{2}$ are positively correlated, quality in the efficiency wage industry also increases with $\\mathfrak{n}$ . Although this condition is necessary for firms to pay efficiency wages, our stayer-mover wage comparisons cannot detect the correlation: wages in efficiency wage industries do not reflect &1.  \n\nNot knowing the quality of any applicant, each firm in industry 1 chooses a wage premium to minimize labor cost. Firms lower labor cost by raising the wage provided the higher wage attracts a sufficiently higher-skilled pool of applicants. This produces an efficiency wage premium, with employment rationed in industry 1. Firms have no incentive to cut wages in the face of queues, and workers cannot gain employment by offering to work for less than the efficiency wage. Although the efficiency wage premium raises the wage in industry 1, the efficiency wage need not exceed the average wage in industry 2; indeed, selfselection is a force toward higher-average wages outside the efficiency wage industry.  \n\nConsider the effect of an increase in industry 1's demand for labor. With no shift in the distribution of worker skills, the efficiency wage remains unchanged. Firms in industry 1 employ a greater proportion of job applicants. Therefore, shifts in employment do not imply relative wage movements. Up to the point where rationing ceases, industry 1 appears to face a perfectly elastic supply of labor.10  \n\n#### E. Comparison  \n\nThe market-clearing and queuing models predict different patterns for the wage changes of interindustry movers. First, with queuing for jobs in the efficiency wage industries, the resulting industry wage effects would violate our bounds on the wage growths of interindustry movers: entrants to high-wage industries would violate it with excessive growth (i.e., jumps up) and leavers from high-wage industries with insufficient growth (i.e., jumps down). Second, if efficiency wages were selection based and skills were revealed (or quit rates declined) over a worker's career, then the importance of industry wage effects would decline with age.  \n\nDoes the Roy model admit industry wage effects on the wage changes of interindustry movers (i.e., fixed-effect estimates)? Roy's model simply does not preclude differences across industries in the average wage growth of interindustry movers. Since a worker's labor input $x_{i}$ is indexed by industry i, this wage component is not fixed for movers, so it cannot be eliminated by time differencing. (See Gibbons and Katz 1992; and Keane 1993, p. 142, for related discussions of the inconsistency of fixedeffect estimates of industry wage effects.) Nevertheless, implied bounds on the wage growth of interindustry movers restrict the magnitudes of the industry wage effects within the Roy model. Average wage growth of interindustry movers can vary across industries but only within the bounds of source and target stayers? wage growths (proposition, above). The bounds are typically less than a few percentage points (table 7, below), so there is little room for sizable industry wage effects within the context of the Roy model.  \n\nWithout solid evidence supporting the bounds on wage growth of interindustry movers, including small magnitudes for industry wage effects, we check for patterns consistent with the market-clearing extensions of the Roy model. With career dynamics, movers accept jobs in low-wage industries only in exchange for a high value of future prospects. If those prospects are within the initial industry, industry wage effects should be negative for the young and positive for the old, and industry wage effects of the young should be negatively correlated with industry stayers' wage growth rates and industry retention rates. Alternatively, in the case of stepping-stone industries, violations of the bounds on wage growth should be on the high side, with leavers' wage growth exceeding the wage growth of stayers in the target industry. Rejecting these implications would favor explanations of cyclical upgrading based on queuing or compensating differentials.  \n\nA final test enables us to distinguish queuing from compensating wage differentials for unobserved industry attributes. Interindustry movers in our market-clearing models are marginal. In the Roy model, this means that a mover's premove and postmove wages must be close, so each mover's wage in his source industry should be an excellent predictor of his wage in his target industry. With compensating differentials, industry identifiers would also be informative, but the predictive power of past wages should remain strong. Because wages in efficiency wage industries are unrelated to unobserved components of skill, a mover's premove wage in a low-wage industry would poorly predict his postmove wage in a high-wage cyclical industry. (The coefficient on premove wages would suffer from an attenuation bias associated with a component of variance unrelated to postmove wages.) Yet premove wages should be excellent predictors for interindustry movers outside the effciency wage industries. Therefore, weaker predictive power of premove wages for those moving into or out from high-wage cyclical industries would favor queuing over the equilibrium selection model with compensating wage differentials for unobserved industry attributes.  \n\n## IV. Data  \n\nIdeally, data for estimating the industry selection model would include five features. First, the sample should be representative of the working age population of the United States. Second, since we analyze movers from industry $_i$ to industry $j,$ which in any year is a small fraction of the population, we need a large data set. Third, since our estimators compare wages before and after industry changes, individuals must be surveyed at least twice. Fourth, to address aggregate fluctuations, the data should extend over a fairly long period. Fifth, individuals should report pay and industry of employer at the time of the interview, rather than over the past year. (For industry movers, the past year's wages reflect pay in at least two industries.)  \n\nRecognizing that no publicly available data set satisfies all these features, we selected the PSID on the basis of its advantages and our ability to cope with its disadvantages.11 Beginning in 1968, the PSID is an ongoing panel of thousands of households. Data are currently available through 1992, but industry data have been reported since only 1971. This leaves 22 years of data to uncover the effects of aggregate fluctuations on interindustry mobility. The PSID includes annual observations covering survey week pay with the main employer, the employer's industry, as well as earnings, weeks worked, and usual hours worked per week last year.  \n\nFor our purposes, the PSID also has deficiencies. Because the PSID studies families, most of the information concerns the household's head. Spouse's survey week responses have been collected regularly since only 1979. For our purposes, the PSID is also small. Although we might start with more than 1oo,0o0 person-year observations on the working-age population, annual transitions among narrowly classified industries would produce many unacceptably small cell sizes. To remedy this, we analyze 22 industries plus nonemployment.  \n\nTwo key variables in our analysis are industry indicators and wage rates. Industry mobility compares reported industry of employment at one survey date to the reported industry at the survey the following year. Many of the workers who change industry classification from one year to the next appear to remain with the same employer. Because these are likely to reflect errors in reporting industry affliation, we exclude these observations from the sample.  \n\nOur measure of wages uses the respondent's report of his survey week pay on his main job. For hourly paid workers we use the straight-time hourly wage rate. For salaried workers we transform the survey-week report of annual salary to an hourly wage by dividing salary by predicted annual hours worked during the survey year.12 We predict annual hours based on a regression that includes fixed effects for persons, industries, and years. (Predicted values account for most of the variation in annual hours.) Our wage variable is inflated to 1992 dollars using the gross domestic product (GDP) deflator.13  \n\nWe treat the nonmarket sector (i.e., unemployment or out of the labor force) as an industry like any other. Unfortunately, we do not observe the wage rate —-the value of time out of the labor market-—-for the nonmarket sector. We take two approaches to this deficiency. One approach is to ignore the nonmarket sector to estimate the mover-stayer wage comparisons as if all workers are always employed. (The nonmarket sector does not present a problem for our analysis of the wage changes of industry stayers or our analysis of the wage changes of interindustry movers.) We also impute wages for workers in the nonmarket sector. Almost all individuals participate in the labor market at some time. With a long panel of data, we can use reported market wages in previous and future years to impute a value of time at home. We use the lowest value of each person's wage to proxy for his or her nonmarket wage.14 This might be an error-ridden measure for any particular individual, but we expect this to be less problematic for our wage comparisons, which rely on withinindustry averages of wages.  \n\nTable2 Summary Statistics (Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1979-92)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Mean</td><td>Standard Deviation</td><td>Number of Observations</td></tr><tr><td>Householdhead</td><td>.54</td><td>.50</td><td>54,680</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>40.77</td><td>13.76</td><td>54,680</td></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>.41</td><td>.49</td><td>54,680</td></tr><tr><td>White</td><td>.90</td><td>.30</td><td>54,547</td></tr><tr><td>Disabled</td><td>.16</td><td>.36</td><td>50,828</td></tr><tr><td>Standard metropolitan statistical area</td><td>.54</td><td>.50</td><td>54,630</td></tr><tr><td>Married</td><td>.81</td><td>.39</td><td>54,680</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>12.72</td><td>2.60</td><td>54,253</td></tr><tr><td>Weeksworkedlastyear</td><td>32.01</td><td>21.06</td><td>54,262</td></tr><tr><td>Weeklyhoursworkedlastyear</td><td>29.72</td><td>19.60</td><td>54,130</td></tr><tr><td>Employed</td><td>.64</td><td>.48</td><td>54,680</td></tr><tr><td>Industry mover</td><td>.18</td><td>.38</td><td>50,636</td></tr><tr><td>Separatedfrom employer*</td><td>.10</td><td>.29</td><td>37,725</td></tr><tr><td>Union contract*</td><td>.22</td><td>.42</td><td>35,329</td></tr><tr><td>Real hourly rate of pay (1992 $)</td><td>12.95</td><td>7.44</td><td>35,063</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\\* These variables are defined only on the sample of employed persons.  \n\nOverall, our sample from the PSID includes detailed information on the mobility across 23 industries of a representative sample of 18-70 year-old household heads and spouses in a 14-year panel from 1979 through 1992. After excluding the self-employed, we are left with a sample of 7,531 persons who contribute 54,680 person-year observations (or better than 7 years per person). Summary statistics are reported in table 2. Where using a longer panel is essential, we extend the sample back to the less representative period beginning in 1971.  \n\nTable 3 displays employment shares and average wages in the PSID by industry. The distribution of workers across industries is largely consistent with the aggregate establishment numbers reported in table 1, although the sample periods differ. Our PSID sample does have considerably smaller fractions in Agriculture and Wholesale Trade and higher fractions in Health Services and in Education.  \n\nThe relative industry wages reported in table 3 from the PSID are similar to those in table 1 from establishment data, but there are differences. Construction wages are relatively high in the PSID but not nearly as high as in the establishment data. Wages in Education are a little higher than average in the PSID but a little lower than average in the establishment data.  \n\nTable3 Industry Summary Statistics (Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1979-92)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">In Wage*</td><td colspan=\"2\">In Wage Residualt</td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td>Employment Share</td><td>Standard Mean Deviation</td><td>Mean</td><td>Standard Deviation</td></tr><tr><td>Nonmarket</td><td>35.9</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Agriculture</td><td>.8</td><td>-.536 .495</td><td>-.387</td><td>.419</td></tr><tr><td>Mining</td><td>.5</td><td>.198 .457</td><td>.177</td><td>.379</td></tr><tr><td>Construction</td><td>3.0</td><td>.103</td><td>.433</td><td>.105 .373</td></tr><tr><td>Metals</td><td>1.3</td><td>.075</td><td>.340</td><td>.078 .307</td></tr><tr><td>Machinery</td><td>3.6</td><td>.172</td><td>.462</td><td>.126 .331</td></tr><tr><td>Transportation Equipment</td><td>2.3</td><td>.276</td><td>.391</td><td>.241 .299</td></tr><tr><td>Other Durables</td><td>2.0</td><td>-.021</td><td>.439</td><td>.023 .327</td></tr><tr><td>Food&Tobacco</td><td>1.2</td><td>.005</td><td>.456</td><td>.054 .366</td></tr><tr><td>Textiles, Apparel, & Leather</td><td>1.2</td><td>-.500</td><td>.378 -.161</td><td>.324</td></tr><tr><td>Paper, Printing, & Publishing</td><td>1.7</td><td>.038</td><td>.512</td><td>.026 .367</td></tr><tr><td>Chemicals,Petroleum,& Rubber</td><td>1.5</td><td>.174</td><td>.448 .109</td><td>.307</td></tr><tr><td>Transportation</td><td>2.3</td><td>.168</td><td>.449</td><td>.120 .425</td></tr><tr><td>Communications & Utilities</td><td>3.0</td><td>.284</td><td>.393 .483</td><td>.214 .351</td></tr><tr><td>WholesaleTrade Retail Trade,Entertainment,</td><td>1.5</td><td>-.035</td><td>-.062</td><td>.386</td></tr><tr><td>& Recreation</td><td>7.7</td><td>-.409</td><td>.479</td><td>-.269 .399</td></tr><tr><td>Finance, Insurance, & Real Estate</td><td>4.1</td><td>.024 .467</td><td>.045</td><td>.360</td></tr><tr><td>Business &Repair Services</td><td>1.8</td><td>-.058</td><td>.543 -.073</td><td>.447</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Services</td><td>1.2</td><td>-.494</td><td>.472 -.248</td><td>.448</td></tr><tr><td>Health Services</td><td>7.1</td><td>-.066</td><td>.464</td><td>.000 .379</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>8.4</td><td>.145</td><td>.547</td><td>-.005 .434</td></tr><tr><td>Other Professional Services</td><td>2.5</td><td>-.003</td><td>.476</td><td>-.064 .425</td></tr><tr><td>Public Administration</td><td>5.4</td><td>.158</td><td>.447</td><td>.074 .373</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNoTE.—Sample size is 54,680, with 35,063 reporting wages in one of the 22 market industries.

The residuals are derived from a single regression of log wages on individual characteristics, including age, education, sex, race, and a number of interactions. Differences in these characteristics explain a substantial fraction of the disparity in wage rates across industries. In absolute value, the industry wage effects average $17.1\\%$ using log wages and $10.4\\%$ using log-wage residuals. So observable characteristics reduce the magnitude of the industry effects by about $40\\%$  \n\n## V. Empirical Results  \n\nThe empirical work proceeds in three stages. First, we compare wages of industry movers to industry stayers. This reveals whether the structure of relative wages is consistent with cyclical upgrading within Roy's equilibrium model of industry selection. Second, we examine the wage changes of industry stayers. By controlling for the compositional effects of low-wage workers entering and exiting cyclical industries, this identifies the cyclical behavior of industry wage rates. Third, we compare the wage changes of industry movers to the wage changes of stayers. This tests the selection model's prediction that movers’ wage changes are bounded by the wage changes of stayers in the source and target industries.  \n\n### A. Mover-Stayer Wage Comparisons  \n\nFor the Roy model to generate cyclical upgrading, we should find positive selection in all or most industries. So workers entering cyclical industries during expansions should have had relatively low wages compared to workers in the less cyclical industry they left, and they should have relatively low wages compared to workers in the cyclical industry they join.  \n\nTable 4 displays these wage comparisons of industry movers and stayers from 1979 to 1992. Comparisons are presented separately for periods when an industry's share of the population is declining and for periods when it is growing. For each interindustry mover, we compute the average wages of his coworkers in his source industry (premove) and of his coworkers in his target industry (postmove). We average these, as well as the movers wages, by industry.15 We include observations from the nonmarket sector with imputed wages. The results are not sensitive to excluding the nonmarket sector.  \n\nWage comparisons of industry stayers and interindustry movers are consistent with our application of the Roy model to cyclical upgrading. For almost every industry, movers have relatively low wages compared to their coworkers in both the industry they leave and the industry they join. Consider periods of decline. Twenty of the 22 industries exhibit positive selection in column 1, that is, workers who leave the declining industry were lower paid before leaving than those who remain. The difference is statistically significant for 16 of these 20 industries. (For the two industries with negative selection, the difference is not statistically significant.) Positive selection is strongest for the following industries: Food $\\&$ Tobacco; Paper, Printing, & Publishing; Transportation; and  \n\nTable4 Wage Comparisons of Stayers and Movers: Log Wages (Panel Study of Income Dynamics,1979-92)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Declining</td><td colspan=\"2\">Growing</td></tr><tr><td>Industry i</td><td>W -W</td><td>W,t+1 W,t+1 一</td><td>W,t+1 W,t+1</td><td>W-W</td></tr><tr><td>Nonmarket</td><td>20.22</td><td>32.47</td><td>3.77</td><td>16.66</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(1.33)</td><td>(1.53)</td><td>(1.49)</td><td>(1.57)</td></tr><tr><td>Agriculture</td><td>-.90</td><td>37.09</td><td>5.08</td><td>35.96</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(7.19)</td><td>(6.43)</td><td>(6.93)</td><td>(11.71)</td></tr><tr><td>Mining</td><td>15.79</td><td>1.79</td><td>29.76</td><td>4.67</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(8.75)</td><td>(9.16)</td><td>(9.64)</td><td>(11.02)</td></tr><tr><td>Construction</td><td>17.15</td><td>-.84</td><td>25.46</td><td>11.50</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.15)</td><td>(4.00)</td><td>(3.41)</td><td>(3.73)</td></tr><tr><td>Metals</td><td>5.48</td><td>-3.88</td><td>9.44</td><td>6.80</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.53)</td><td>(4.62)</td><td>(7.19)</td><td>(7.47)</td></tr><tr><td>Machinery</td><td>17.94</td><td>2.13</td><td>33.28</td><td>16.96</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.85)</td><td>(4.30)</td><td>(4.77)</td><td>(4.78)</td></tr><tr><td>Transportation Equipment</td><td>9.63</td><td>-16.00</td><td>29.80</td><td>-5.87</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.82)</td><td>(4.55)</td><td>(5.87)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>OtherDurables</td><td>16.00</td><td>11.26</td><td>15.71</td><td>(7.16)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.28)</td><td>(4.42)</td><td></td><td>6.13</td></tr><tr><td>Food & Tobacco</td><td>33.52</td><td>16.69</td><td>(11.91)</td><td>(11.06)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(5.35)</td><td>(4.67)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Textiles, Apparel, & Leather</td><td>8.69</td><td>34.19</td><td>26.58</td><td>43.15</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.85)</td><td>(3.71)</td><td>(5.40)</td><td>(7.14)</td></tr><tr><td>Paper, Printing, & Publishing</td><td>32.35</td><td>17.42</td><td>42.17</td><td>30.35</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(6.54)</td><td>(6.21)</td><td>(9.40)</td><td>(9.39)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemicals, Petroleum, & Rubber</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>26.18</td><td>-1.24</td><td>31.42</td><td>6.01</td></tr><tr><td>Transportation</td><td>(6.83) 30.13</td><td>(6.93)</td><td>(7.75)</td><td>(8.08)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(6.04)</td><td>2.64 (5.20)</td><td>37.60 (5.91)</td><td>12.52 (5.18)</td></tr><tr><td>Communications & Utilities</td><td>15.21</td><td>-5.86</td><td>35.74</td><td>.61</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(9.26)</td></tr><tr><td>WholesaleTrade</td><td>(6.04) 26.04</td><td>(6.49) 13.25</td><td>(8.34) 22.17</td><td>17.01</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(5.38)</td><td>(5.30)</td><td>(5.98)</td><td>(5.25)</td></tr><tr><td>Retail Trade,Entertainment,</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&Recreation</td><td>21.24</td><td>39.01</td><td>29.11</td><td>38.78</td></tr><tr><td>Finance, Insurance,& Real</td><td>(2.32)</td><td>(2.18)</td><td>(2.36)</td><td>(2.21)</td></tr><tr><td>Estate</td><td>18.16</td><td>6.59</td><td>25.79</td><td>19.97</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(4.76)</td><td>(4.61)</td><td>(4.21)</td><td>(3.65)</td></tr><tr><td>Business & Repair Services</td><td>5.23</td><td>18.95</td><td>34.09</td><td>17.18</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(10.65)</td><td>(10.20)</td><td>(4.08)</td><td>(3.39)</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Services</td><td>13.03</td><td>41.57</td><td>15.20</td><td>35.84</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(4.70)</td><td>(3.97)</td></tr><tr><td>Health Services</td><td>(7.30)</td><td>(4.73)</td><td>25.64</td><td>17.97</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(2.60)</td><td>(2.29)</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>15.25</td><td>-8.99</td><td>35.03</td><td>8.35</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(6.78)</td><td>(5.90)</td><td>(3.61)</td><td>(2.93)</td></tr><tr><td>Other Professional Services</td><td>-23.00</td><td>-28.10</td><td>20.28</td><td>12.96</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(22.12)</td><td>(21.43)</td><td>(4.36)</td><td>(3.66)</td></tr><tr><td>Public Administration</td><td>32.92</td><td>11.28</td><td>32.36</td><td>15.28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(5.54)</td><td>(5.18)</td><td>(4.77)</td><td>(4.84)</td></tr><tr><td>Employment-weighted</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>average</td><td>15.54</td><td>6.71</td><td>28.31</td><td>16.74</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNoTE.—Based on 31,166 observations on industry stayers, 3,187 observations on leavers from declining industries, and 3,818 entrants to growing industries. $\\mathbb{W}_{\\mathcal{k}\\tau}^{g}$ is the average logwage at time $\\uptau$ of group $g$ workers employed in industry $k$ groups $g$ are stayers s, entrants $e,$ and leavers $\\tilde{l.}$ The listed industry i is the source in declining periods and the target in growing periods. The averages are weighted by annual transition matrices; see app. C for details. Standard errors are in parentheses.  \n\nPublic Administration. The average difference between the wages of stayers and leavers is $16\\%$ . Positive selection also dominates in column 2: in 15 out of 22 cases, entrants earn relatively low wages in their new industry. On average, the existing workers in those industries earn $7\\%$ higher wages than the arriving workers from declining industries earn.  \n\nResults for expanding periods paint an even sharper picture of positive selection. In the third column, without exception, entrants have lower wages than the wages of stayers in their target industry, and the differences are large and statistically significant in almost every industry. Indeed, the average difference between the postmove wages of entrants and target-industry stayers is $28\\%$ . In column 4, with a single exception, premove wages of movers to expanding industries are less than the wages of stayers from their source industries; again, the differences are usually large (averaging $17\\%$ ) and statistically significant.  \n\nThe estimated wage comparisons are substantially larger in growing periods. This asymmetry between declining and growing periods is not anticipated by the Roy model. From the perspective of the Roy model, workers appear to be more similar when an industry declines.  \n\nWage comparisons reported in table 4 combine observed and unobserved components of log wages. For the question of cyclical upgrading, this is appropriate. To characterize interindustry mobility more generally, splitting log wages into its unobserved and observed components is useful. How important is selection on unobservables relative to selection on observables? Is there positive or negative selection on the unobserved component?  \n\nOur stayer-mover comparisons of log-wage residuals in table 5 indicate that a substantial amount of selection is on the unobserved component of log wages. (Our unobserved component of log wages is the residual from a regression of log wages on age, age squared, sex, race, education, marital status, disability, and location, as well as interactions of sex with age, education, race, and marital status.) The results in table 5 reinforce our evidence from table 4 of widespread positive selection. However, the magnitudes are smaller in table 5. For instance, the wage comparisons in column 1 of table 5 average $7\\%$ comparedto $16\\%$ in table 4. Overall, roughly half of the differences in wages between interindustry movers and stayers is attributable to unobserved differences in skill.  \n\nThe main message from these results is that interindustry movers tend to be below average. Consequently, industries are not ordered. Although the best workers in low-wage industry $_i$ would be the worst workers in high-wage industry $j_{:}$ the best workers in high-wage industry $j$ would also be the worst workers in industry i. In this way, our results echo Willis and Rosen's (1979) finding for self-selection between high school and college.  \n\nThe evidence of widespread positive selection implies considerable comparative advantage across industries, and industry labor supply schedules reflect such comparative advantage.16 If the wages of industry entrants are substantially less than the wages of industry stayers, then labor supply to that industry is likely to be fairly inelastic. If industry entrants are paid about the same as industry stayers, industry labor supply is likely to be quite elastic. Thus, the relative wage comparisons can be used to indicate which industries have relatively elastic labor supply schedules.  \n\nTable5 Wage Comparisons of Stayers and Movers: Log Wage Residuals

transition matrices; see app. B for details. Standard errors are in parentheses.  \n\nAdopting a distributional assumption allows us to quantify the industry labor supply elasticities. We follow Roy in assuming that skills are lognormally distributed. With this assumption, the relative wage comparisons in table 4 yield fairly large industry labor supply elasticities; the elasticities are greater than three for 14 of the market industries. The industry labor supply elasticities tend to be larger in cyclical industries, such as the durable manufacturing industries, but agriculture's labor supply elasticity is also estimated to be quite large (13.1). The correlation between our estimated supply elasticities and the industry employment elasticities from table 1 is .21 including and .49 excluding agriculture.  \n\nLarge labor supply elasticities in cyclical industries might account for the failure of relative wages in these industries to increase during expansions. To address this directly, we assess the compositional effects in industry average wages and search for patterns across industries in the wage changes of industry stayers.  \n\n### B. Wage Changes of Stayers  \n\nAnalyzing the wage changes of industry stayers has the advantage of purging compositional effects that contaminate fluctuations in industry average wages. From table 4, workers moving between industries are primarily low-wage workers. Therefore, as many workers move into construction and durable manufacturing during a cyclical expansion, the average skill of workers in those industries declines. This compositional effect might hide important wage movements across industries over the business cycle.  \n\nIndustry wages do contain important compositional effects. Consider the case of Construction. From table 1, a $1\\%$ aggregate expansion in employment would typically be associated with a $2.67\\%$ increase in Construction employment. Table 4 shows that entrants to Construction have wages averaging $25.46\\%$ less than experienced Construction workers. If the expansion in employment occurs through entry, this entry reduces the average wage in Construction by about $0.68\\%$ ,_which is sizable. Indeed, correcting for the compositional effect raises Construction's cyclical wage elasticity from $-0.14$ in table 1 to 0.54. However, the issue is whether Construction's relative wage is procyclical; for this, we must correct for the compositional effect in aggregate wages. Table 4 shows that new entrants to the aggregate work force reduce the average aggregate wage by $0.32\\%$ . Therefore, the cyclical sensitivity of Construction's relative wage is estimated to be 0.22. Correcting for the compositional bias produces a procyclical relative wage for Construction.  \n\nWe can directly control for compositional effects by examining the wage changes of industry stayers. Wage changes of industry stayers identify the growth rate of each industry's wage rate (Yit = In @\\*,t+1 $-\\ln\\omega_{i t}^{*})$ . So fluctuations in stayers? wage changes can be used to estimate the cyclical sensitivity of industry wage rates (purged of compositional effects) and how this cyclical sensitivity varies across industries.  \n\nOur sample of industry stayers contains 28,201 person-year observations on 5,198 workers between 1971 and 1992. Controlling for age and change of union status, we estimate the effects of changes in aggregate employment $\\Delta$ In $E_{t}$ and industry employment share $\\Delta\\ln(E_{i t}/E_{t})$ on the wage growth of industry stayers $\\Delta W_{i t}^{s}$ .We also interact the industry employment share variable with the cyclical sensitivity of industry employment to detect whether more cyclical industries have more or less cyclical wages.  \n\nIn table 6, we report least squares, fixed effects, and random-effects estimates of industry stayers′ wage growth. The estimates reveal that true industry wages are procyclical and that the amount of wage change depends on how the industry's employment share varies over the business cycle. For instance, the random-effects estimates imply that a $1\\%$ increase in aggregate employment is associated with a $21\\%$ increase in the industry wage.17 For comparison, a regression of log wages on $\\log E_{t},$ as well as many individual control variables, in our PSID sample produces an  \n\nTable6 Wage Changes of Industry Stayers (Panel Study of Income Dynamics 1971-92)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Least Squares 1</td><td>Least Squares 2</td><td>Fixed Effects</td><td>Random Effects</td></tr><tr><td>Intercept</td><td>6.261</td><td>6.057</td><td>8.575</td><td>6.356</td></tr><tr><td>△lnEt</td><td>(.446) .131</td><td>(.455) .203</td><td>(1.366) .178</td><td>(.518) .207</td></tr><tr><td>△InE,xβ</td><td>(.060) .120</td><td>(.068)</td><td>(.080)</td><td>(.069)</td></tr><tr><td>△eit</td><td>(.056) .149</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>△ In(Eit/E)</td><td>(.038)</td><td>.181</td><td>.132</td><td>.171</td></tr><tr><td>△In(Eit/E)×β</td><td></td><td>(.040) -.090</td><td>(.054)</td><td>(.043)</td></tr><tr><td>Uniont</td><td></td><td>(.038)</td><td>-.079 (.050)</td><td>-.091 (.040)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2.857 (.566)</td><td>2.859 (.566)</td><td>2.749 (.615)</td><td>2.810 (.565)</td></tr><tr><td>Aget</td><td>-.108</td><td>-.108</td><td>-.171</td><td>.114</td></tr><tr><td>Test statistic*</td><td>(.011)</td><td>(.011)</td><td>(.034)</td><td>(.012)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>.339</td><td>537.8</td><td>.742</td><td>4.55</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[.561]</td><td>[.000]</td><td>[1.000]</td><td>[.603]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Standard deviation of person effect</td><td></td><td></td><td>13.276</td><td>5.011</td></tr><tr><td>Root mean squared error</td><td>19.644</td><td>19.642</td><td>20.127</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>20.127</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>.005</td><td>.006</td><td>.003</td><td>.006</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nNoTE.-28,201 observations on 5,198 persons per regression, Standard errors are displayed in parentheses. △ In $E_{t}$ is the growth rate of aggregate employment, $\\ln(E_{i t}/E_{t})$ is the growth rate of industry i's employment relative toaggregate employment, $\\Delta\\mathfrak{E}_{i t}^{e}$ is the component of industry i's relative employment growth that is uncorrelated with aggregate employment growth, and $\\upbeta_{i}^{e}$ is industry i's cyclical employment elasticity from table 1.  \n\n\\* The test statistics correspond to the following: for least squares 1, the $F$ -testofequalityof the coefficients associated with the two components of industry relative employment growth; for least squares 2,the Breusch-Pagan Lagrange Multiplier test for the presence of person effects; for fixed effects, the $F$ test for significanceof5,198fixed effects;forrandom effects,theHausman testfor stability of the parameter estimates to detect whether the random effects are correlatedwith the observables.The $\\boldsymbol{\\ p}$ -valuesarereportedinbrackets.  \n\naggregate elasticity of -.07 (.02); consequently, controlling for composition uncovers a procyclical wage.  \n\nThe estimated wage elasticities vary appreciably across industries, with cyclical industries -those with increasing employment shares in expansions - displaying substantially bigger cyclical wage responses.18 The least squares regression in the first column interacts the industry employment elasticity $\\upbeta_{i}^{e}$ from table 1 with aggregate employment growth. The is not sufficient to reject the consistency of the random-effects estimates. In addition, an $F$ -test fails to reject the null of no fixed effects.  \n\nestimated coefficient associated with this cyclical employment share variable is .12; this implies that the most cyclical industries (i.e., Metals; Machinery; and Transportation Equipment) have cyclical wage responses of about $.33~(=~.13~+~.12~\\times~1.75)$ and that acyclical industries (i.e., Agriculture and Health Services) have negligible cyclical wage responses $(=.13+.12\\times(-1.0))$ . Idiosyncratic variation in industry employment shares also generates wage responses. Indeed, we do not reject the hypothesis of equal effects for the cyclical and idiosyncratic components of variation in industry employment shares. Hence, we combine the two components in table 6's other specifications.  \n\nIn cyclical expansions, composition-corrected wages increase more in cyclical industries, but Do these industry wage rates increase as much as would be predicted by the sizable increases in their employment shares? We address this issue by interacting growth in the industry employment sharewith $\\upbeta_{i}^{e}$ , the industry employment elasticity from table 1. The least squares, fixed effects, and random-effects estimates in table 6 each detect a significant negative interaction. Since composition-corrected wages move less in cyclical industries than would be predicted by changes in their employment shares, industry labor supply schedules appear to be more elastic in cyclical industries. (This reinforces our evidence on labor supply elasticities based on mover-stayer wage comparisons.) Despite the negative interaction, composition-corrected wages remain more cyclical in cyclical industries. For instance, from the random-effects estimates, the implied industry wage elasticities range from -.08 for Agriculture to .28 for Other Durables.  \n\nThus, our evidence on the wage changes of industry stayers confirms Keane's (1993) finding that narrowing of industry wage differentials in cyclical expansitions vanishes when one controls for industry composition. In addition, the estimates in table 6 reveal that composition corrected wage rates are more cyclical in cyclical industries, strongly supporting the market-clearing model of selection.  \n\n### C. Wage Changes of Movers  \n\nRoy's market-clearing selection model implies that the wage change of an interindustry mover is bounded by the wage change of stayers in the mover's source industry and the wage change of stayers in the mover's target industry. We search for meaningful violations of this proposition by averaging wage changes across movers. For instance, if an industry's employment is growing, Is the average wage growth of its entrants less than the average wage growth of stayers in that target industry and greater than the (weighted) average wage growth of stayers in all the source industries? And a similar comparison of averages applies to leavers from declining industries. Estimation amounts to computing 132 weighted averages—- one for each entry in table 7—- of a single wage growth variable.19 For this analysis, we extend the sample back to 1971.  \n\nOur point estimates reported in table 7 reveal widespread violations of the proposition. Of the 44 possible comparisons, only two sets of point estimates satisfy the restriction: Wholesale Trade in declining periods and Other Durables in growing periods. But the wage growth estimates are not precise for leavers and entrants. Indeed, statistically significant violations occur in only 11 of the 44 cases. (Retail Trade, Recreation, & Entertainment, both when declining and growing, is an example.) Given the substantial dispersion of wage changes in panel data (McLaughlin $1994b)$ , our sample contains too few observations on interindustry movers for complete comparisons by industry.  \n\nAveraging the results across industries illuminates the underlying patterns. These cross-industry averages are reported in the last row of table 7. For each of the three groups (i.e., source stayers, movers, and target stayers), wage growth is higher when the listed industry is growing. These averages also reveal a tendency for wage growth to be higher in target industries than in source industries. But the strongest pattern from table 7 is that the wage growth of movers is too high: leavers from a declining industry and entrants to growing industries tend to exhibit higher-wage growth than stayers in their target industries.  \n\nOur evidence on the wage changes of interindustry movers provides little support for the Roy model. Not only is the average wage growth of leavers too high, but the wage cuts of leavers are deepest in high-wage industries. Indeed, the cross-industry correlation of leavers wage growth with industry wage residuals (from table 3) is -.75. A similar pattern emerges for industry entrants in growing periods. Not only does the average wage growth of entrants exceed that of stayers in target industries, but the wage gains of entrants are biggest in high-wage industries: the cross-industry correlation of entrants? wage growth with industry wage residuals is .77. Furthermore, industries with low wage-growth leavers tend to be industries with high wage-growth entrants: the crossindustry correlation between the wage growths of leavers in declining periods and entrants in growing periods is -.56.  \n\nTable7 Wage Changes of Industry Stayers and Interindustry Movers (Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 197i-92)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td

leavers from declining industries, and 1,642 on entrants into growing industries. Cells with fewer than 15 observations are suppressed. \\* The listed industry is the source industry in years when its employment is declining relative to total employment and the target industry in years when its employment is growing relative to total employment.  \n\nAlthough these patterns are consistent with leavers being dismissed from and entrants gaining access to high-wage industries, they are also consistent with compensating differentials for unobserved industry attributes. The source of the rejections does not, however, appear to be career dynamics. If workers accept low wages in retailing to learn some basic job skills and move on to jobs in other industries, then table 7's violations for Retail Trade, Entertainment, & Recreation would make sense. But the same patterns exist for Agriculture and for Textiles, Apparel, & Leather, two other low-wage industries, and these industries are almost surely not stepping stone industries for career advancement.  \n\nA complementary regression reinforces these inferences. On a sample of 3,102 interindustry movers, we regress each mover's wage change on the average wage change of stayers in the mover's target industry, the average wage change of stayers in the mover's source industry, age, and a set of differenced union and industry dummy variables. Although the coefficients reported in regression 1 of table 8 are positive, as expected, neither is significantly different from zero. The wage growth of interindustry movers is basically unrelated to the wage growths of stayers in source and target industries.20  \n\nTable 8 presents evidence of significant industry wage effects in regressions 2 and 3. Controlling for age and changes in union status, we detect wage gains to entering and wage losses to leaving high-wage industries. The employment-weighted correlation of the industry wage effects from regression 3 with the industry mean log-wage residuals from table 3 is .91. So industry wage effects survive differencing.  \n\nIn terms of testing the Roy model, however, the question is whether the industry wage effects are sufficiently small. Wage changes of interindustry movers contain industry wage effects that are substantially smaller than—about half the magnitude of-those estimated from log-wage residuals. The employment-weighted average magnitude of the industry wage effects from table 8, regression 2 or 3, is 5.8, which compares to 10.4 for the industry log-wage residuals from table 3. Alternatively, in table 9, we report the results of regressing changes in the log wages of 3,102 movers on differenced industry log-wage residuals, as well as age and a variable for change in union status. The estimated coefficient on differenced industry log-wage residuals is 0.44, so a little less than half of industry wage residuals translate into movers wages. Either way, a substantial fraction of interindustry wage differences appears to be attributable to unmeasured differences in worker quality across industries, a result that contrasts with Krueger and Summers's (1988) findings.21  \n\nTable8 Wage Changes of Interindustry Movers (Panel Study of Income Dynamics 1971-92)   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>ntercept</td><td>3.096</td><td>11.497</td><td>12.449</td></tr><tr><td>W</td><td>(.929) .346</td><td>(3.043) .306</td><td>(2.969)</td></tr><tr><td>Wt</td><td>(.203) .163</td><td>(.194) .122</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Aget</td><td>(.200)</td><td>(.192) -.222</td><td>-.223</td></tr><tr><td>Union,</td><td></td><td>(.069) 17.584</td><td>(.069) 17.667</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(1.594)</td><td>(1.594)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry:* Agriculture</td><td></td><td>[12.28] -13.250</td><td>[12.27] -13.558</td></tr><tr><td>Mining</td><td></td><td>(3.067) 8.966</td><td>(3.037) 9.389</td></tr><tr><td>Construction</td><td></td><td>(4.534) 11.470</td><td>(4.523) 11.432</td></tr><tr><td>Metals</td><td></td><td>(1.484) 9.855</td><td>(1.484) 9.813</td></tr><tr><td>Machinery</td><td></td><td>(2.400) 5.933</td><td>(2.400) 5.858</td></tr><tr><td>Transportation Equipment</td><td></td><td>(1.691) 6.041</td><td>(1.689) 6.021</td></tr><tr><td>Other Durables</td><td></td><td>(2.189) 2.850</td><td>(2.189) 2.842</td></tr><tr><td>Food &Tobacco</td><td></td><td>(1.929) 1.647</td><td>(1.927) 1.613</td></tr><tr><td>Textiles,Apparel,&Leather</td><td></td><td>(3.173) -8.850</td><td>(3.173) -8.864</td></tr><tr><td>Paper, Printing, & Publishing</td><td></td><td>(3.263) -1.225</td><td>(3.262) -1.180</td></tr><tr><td>Chemicals, Petroleum, & Rubber</td><td></td><td>(2.827) 4.649</td><td>(2.827) 4.478</td></tr><tr><td>Transportation</td><td></td><td>(2.789) 3.504</td><td>(2.787) 3.415</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(2.346) 3.745</td><td>(2.345) 3.793</td></tr><tr><td>Communications &Utilities</td><td></td><td>(2.742) .202</td><td>(2.742) .155</td></tr><tr><td>WholesaleTrade</td><td></td><td>(1.923)</td><td>(1.921) -12.590</td></tr><tr><td>Retail Trade,Entertainment,& Recreation</td><td></td><td>-12.608 (1.060)</td><td>(1.060) 2.256</td></tr><tr><td>Finance, Insurance, & Real Estate</td><td></td><td>2.124 (1.866)</td><td>(1.862) -2.814</td></tr><tr><td>Business & Repair Services</td><td></td><td>2.922 (1.507)</td><td>(1.496)</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Services</td><td></td><td>-13.577 (2.663)</td><td>-13.633 (2.654)</td></tr><tr><td>Health Services</td><td></td><td>.200 (1.842)</td><td>.290 (1.841)</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td></td><td>-1.597 (1.868)</td><td>-1.597 (1.868)</td></tr><tr><td>Other Professional Services</td><td></td><td>.125 (1.855)</td><td>.245 (1.838)</td></tr><tr><td>Public Administration</td><td></td><td>5.818 (1.866)</td><td>5.689</td></tr><tr><td>Root mean squared error 2</td><td>37.497 .001</td><td>35.141 .130</td><td>(1.865) 35.147 .129</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNOTE. $^{-3,102}$ observations on 1,967 persons perleast squares regression.Standard errors are displayed inparentheses. $\\Delta W_{i t}^{s}$ and $\\Delta W_{j\\xi}^{s}$ are the average wage growth rates of stayers in source industry $_i$ and targetindustry $j$ between $t$ and $t+1$ \\*Employment-weighted averages of theindustry effects are restricted to equal zero.The $F$ statistics for the tests of zero industry effects are reported in brackets.  \n\nTable9 Wage Changes and In Wages of Interindustry Movers (Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1971-92)\\*   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"3\">Dependent Variablet</td></tr><tr><td>Variable</td><td>W</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Intercept</td><td>.098</td><td>.094</td><td>.684</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(.026)</td><td>(.026)</td><td>(.035)</td></tr><tr><td>In Wt</td><td></td><td></td><td>.674 (.014)</td></tr><tr><td>In wt X source industry wage residual</td><td></td><td></td><td>.293</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(.063)</td></tr><tr><td>In wt X target industry wage residual</td><td></td><td></td><td>-.075</td></tr><tr><td> Industry wage residual</td><td>.442</td><td></td><td>(.062)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(.030)</td><td>.342</td><td>.724</td></tr><tr><td>△ Industry wage residual × Youngt</td><td></td><td>(.058) .137</td><td>(.131)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(.068)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Aget</td><td>-.002</td><td>-.002</td><td>.001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(.001)</td><td>(.001)</td><td>(.001)</td></tr><tr><td>△Uniont</td><td>.168</td><td>.168</td><td>.141</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(.017)</td><td>(.017)</td><td>(.015)</td></tr><tr><td>Root mean squared error</td><td>.353</td><td>.353</td><td>.323</td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>.116</td><td>.117</td><td>.528</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n\\* Each least squares regression contains 3,102 observations on interindustry movers. Industry wage residuals are from table 3. Young, is a dummy variable indicating age is less than 35 years. Standard errors arereportedinparentheses. $^\\dagger$ For comparability within the table, wage growth is not measured as a percentage. Parameter estimates for the two wage-growth regressions must be scaled by 10o for comparability with the estimates in table 8.  \n\nBut the industry wage effects are not small enough. The magnitude of the industry wage effects average nearly six percentage points. In table 7 the difference between stayers? wage growth in source and target industries is .61 (.28) percentage points in declining (growing) periods. So the industry wage effects appear to be at least an order of magnitude too large.  \n\nTo support the extension of the Roy model to career dynamics, industry wage effects should vary with age. They should either $(a)$ decline in magnitude with age, with older movers having less concern with future prospects or $(b)$ even reverse sign, with present values equalized across industries for young new hires. Industry wage effects do decline with age; the coefficient on industry log-wage residuals falls from .48 for movers under age 35 to .34 for older movers. Although the difference is significant statistically, significant industry wage effects remain for older movers, and our industry wage effects are strongly positively correlated across age groups.22 Furthermore, the idea of young workers accepting jobs in a low-wage industry in exchange for future prospects within that industry is decisively rejected. Estimated industry wage effects of young workers are positively correlated with $(a)$ stayers' wage growth and $(b)$ retention rates across industries; the correlation coefficients are .19 and .31, respectively. Thus, we have strong evidence that the source of the failures of the Roy model in the context of interindustry mobility is not its spot market assumption.23  \n\nThe wage gains and losses to industry mobility could reflect compensating differentials for various aspects of industrial employment, or they could reflect queues for employment in high-wage industries. As we discussed in Section III, the two hypotheses can be disentangled by examining the predictive power of premove wages on postmove wages: an implication of queuing is weaker predictive power for movers into or out from high-wage cyclical industries. In the third column of table 9, we report estimates of the predictive power of past wages for our sample of 3,102 interindustry movers. With controls for age, union status, and industry wage effects, the regression reveals sizable persistence in wages  \n\n22 Correlations of the industry wage effects across three age groups - under 30, 30-44, and over 45 --range from .65 to .76. Using census data, Helwege (1992) documents that industry wage effects are strongly positively correlated across experience groups and decline in magnitude with experience up to 20-25 years ofexperience.  \n\n23 We have not spelled out the implications o all models with caeer dynamics. The door remains open for some model of search or matching, e.g., to fruitfully extend the Roy model in the context of interindustry mobility. For instance, Gibbons and Katz (1992) modify the Roy model to include symmetric learning of unobserved ability. Workers who learn they are higher ability tend to move to industries that have high-ability workers; as a result, least-squares and fixed-effect estimates of industry wage effects can be very similar (Gibbons and Katz 1992, pp. 518-20). Implications of the learning model are very similar to the “steppingstone industries\" version of career dynamics: movers’ wage changes should exhibit industry effects, these industry wage effects should decline with age and eventually vanish, and violations of the bounds on wage changes should be on the high side for leavers and low side for entrants. That industry wage effects do not vanish for old workers is a problem for this model.  \n\nfor even interindustry movers: the coefficient on lagged wages is 0.67.24 Predictive power of past wages does vary by industry but not in the way anticipated by queuing. Wage persistence is basically unrelated to industry wage effects in the mover's target industry. More striking is that the higher the wage in the source industry, the stronger the predictive power of past wages.  \n\n## VI. Summary and Conclusion  \n\nOur point of departure is cyclical upgrading, a set of industry employment and wage patterns over the business cycle. We empirically confirm that industries with high wages tend to exhibit the strongest employment fluctuations, and high-wage and cyclical industries do not have more procyclical average wages. We also find that industry wages relative to aggregate wages are only slightly countercyclical.  \n\nTo capture cyclical upgrading, we apply Roy's (1951) model of equilibrium selection to industry fluctuations. We show that a reasonable specification of the model, one in which each industry employs workers who are above average at work in that industry, captures the empirical patterns of cyclical upgrading. Consequently, cyclical upgrading is consistent with market clearing. We also investigate whether this specification is consistent with interindustry mobility patterns in panel data. The interindustry mobility patterns are derived from $(a)$ comparing the wages of interindustry movers with their coworkers before and after moving, $(b)$ the wage changes of industry stayers, and $(c)$ the wage changes of interindustry movers.  \n\nFrom two simple wage comparisons for each industry, we estimate that almost every industry is characterized by positive selection. That is, each industry does employ workers who are above average at work in that industry, so the estimated selection process would produce cyclical upgrading. The industry wage comparisons also contain evidence of important compositional effects on wages and of industry differences in labor supply elasticities. Indeed, the estimated compositional effects are sufficient to align employment and wage fluctuations across industries. Our industry wage comparisons also indicate that industry labor supply elasticities are more elastic in the high-wage cyclical industries.  \n\nOur analysis of the wage changes of industry stayers, which estimates the evolution of the unobserved industry wage rate, reinforces these conclusions. Industry wage rates increase with aggregate employment and industry employment share, so industry wage rates are more cyclical in cyclical industries. Yet wages in cyclical industries move less than would be predicted by changes in their employment shares alone, and this suggests that industry labor supply functions are more elastic in cyclical industries.  \n\nThe Roy model does fail to explain predictable patterns of wage changes for industry movers. For instance, the wages of workers leaving low-wage industries to enter higher-wage cyclical industries increase by a magnitude that is inconsistent with the wage-based model of self-selection. And although our controls for observed and unobserved differences in ability reduce the magnitude of industry wage effects by two-thirds, significant industry wage effects remain.  \n\nThis would appear to support queuing in a segmented labor market. However, three results work against the queuing extension: first, industry relative wages are not very countercyclical; second, composition-corrected industry wages do increase with industry employment shares; and, third, previous wages are not less powerful in predicting the wages of workers entering or exiting high-wage industries, which suggests that wages are as closely related to skills in high-wage industries as elsewhere.  \n\nWe are left with an equilibrium model of selection that is consistent with cyclical upgrading and other patterns of interindustry mobility in panel data. And the model's failure to explain the wage changes of interindustry movers could be remedied by an extension to compensating wage differentials for industry attributes. Our analysis does not include estimation of compensating differentials, and without evidence of these our explanation of cyclical upgrading remains tentative. However, layoff risk, hours variability, and wage variability are possibilities. These attributes do vary substantially across industries, and sizable compensating differentials are associated with each (Topel 1984).  \n\n### Appendix A Selection Effects on Industry Wages  \n\nLet $\\mathbb{W}_{i,t+1}$ and $W_{i t}$ denote average wages in industry $_i$ in periods $t+1$ and $t$ ,Let ${\\boldsymbol{\\uptheta}}_{i}^{e}$ denote entrants’ share of industry ${\\vec{\\imath\\jmath}}{\\mathfrak{s}}$ employment at $t+1$ and ${\\uptheta}_{i}^{l}$ leavers' share of ${\\vec{\\imath}}^{\\flat}s$ employment at $t$ $1\\mathrm{~-~}\\uptheta_{i}^{e}$ and $1-\\mathsf{\\uptheta}_{i}^{l}$ are the employment shares at $t+1$ and $t$ of industry stayers. Average wages in industry $i$ are the following weighted averages:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{W_{i,t+1}=(1-\\theta_{i}^{e})W_{i,t+1}^{s}+\\theta_{i}^{e}W_{i,t+1}^{e}}}\\ {{W_{i t}=(1-\\theta_{i}^{l})W_{i,t}^{s}+\\theta_{i}^{l}W_{i t}^{l},}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Bar W_{i\\tau}^{g}$ is the average wage of group $g$ —stayers $s$ entrants $e_{\\mathrm{~.~}}$ orleavers $l-$ in industry $i$ at time $\\uptau$ Therefore, the change in average industry wages from $t$ to $t+1$ depends on the wages of entrants and leavers relative to stayers, as well as on the change in average wages of industry stayers.  \n\n$$\n\\Delta W_{i}=\\Delta W_{i}^{s}+\\theta_{i}^{e}(W_{i,t+1}^{e}-W_{i,t+1}^{s})+\\theta_{i}^{l}(W_{i t}^{s}-W_{i t}^{l}).\n$$  \n\nPositive selection case. - Suppose entrants and leavers are below average compared to industry stayers. Then entrants bias the industry wage movements up, and leavers bias the wage movements down. Since cyclically sensitive industries attract lots of entrants in expansions, wage growth in expansions tends to be biased down. (To attract the entrants, the true industry wage must rise relative to any industry from which the entrants are drawn.) Cyclically insensitive industries face the opposite bias. Leavers tend to dominate, which biases industry wage changes up in an expansion. The two biases tend to work against each other for intermediate industries.  \n\nOrdered industry case. --Suppose industries are ordered; in a cyclical expansion industries tend to lose their best workers and gain belowaverage workers. Then entrants and leavers tend to bias the industry wage movements up. That is, interindustry mobility biases each industry's average wage procyclically. For this case, selection biases do not explain the low cyclical wage elasticities in cyclical industries.  \n\nPure queuing case. —Everyone in an industry is paid the same wage, and that wage does not vary through time; all three additive components vanish, so industry average wage changes $\\Delta W_{i}$ are zero. However, aggregate wages are procyclical, as workers move to higher wage industries in expansions. Hence, industry relative wages are all countercyclical.  \n\n### Appendix B Proof of the Proposition  \n\nThe wage growth of stayers in the two industries identifies the evolutions of the shadow prices of labor. That is,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\Delta W_{i}^{s}=\\ln\\upomega_{i,t+1}-\\ln\\upomega_{i t}\\equiv\\upgamma_{i t}}\\ {~}\\ {\\Delta W_{j}^{s}=\\ln\\upomega_{j,t+1}-\\ln\\upomega_{j t}\\equiv\\upgamma_{j t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, we must show that $\\gamma_{i t}<\\Delta W_{i j}^{m}<\\gamma_{j t}.$ Since skills are time invariant,the wage growth of an interindustry mover would have been $\\upgamma_{i t}$ had he not moved. Revealed preference —-accepting the highest wage offer at time $t_{;}$ $\\underline{{W}}_{i t}<W_{j t}$ for a mover-implies a higher wage growth for any mover. Thus, $\\upgamma_{i t}<\\Delta W_{i j}^{m}$ If aninterindustry mover had been n industry $j$ at time $t-1$ , his wage growth would have been $\\boldsymbol{\\upgamma}_{j t}$ Revealed preference at time $t\\mathrm{~-~}1$ implies that $W_{i,t-1}>W_{j,t-1}$ for movers; this implies that $\\Delta\\mathrm{\\Delta}W_{i j}^{m}<\\upgamma_{j t}$ Q.E.D.  \n\nRemarks: First, rather than exploiting revealed preference, one can explicitly express the wage growth of movers using self-selection to truncate the random variables. A little manipulation yields $\\Delta\\_W_{i j}^{m}=\\Delta W_{i}^{s}$ $^+$ a positive term, and $\\Delta W_{i j.}^{m}=\\Delta W_{j}^{s}$ - a positive term. Second, the proposition does not depend on whether there is positive selection, negative selection, or a mix. Third, the revealed preference arguments depend on the absence of compensating wage differentials and transitory variation of skills. With compensating wage differentials or transitory variation of skills, we cannot invoke the two wage comparisons exploited in the proof. Fourth, the proposition can survive rent sharing. If a worker's wage income in industry $\\mathbf{\\chi}_{i}$ were a convex combination of the shadow values of his labor in industries $\\mathbf{\\chi}_{i}$ and $i^{\\prime}$ (his best alternative), his wage growth in moving must be bounded by the wage growths of stayers in the two industries. See McLaughin $(1994a)$ . Fifth, the proposition applies to each interindustry mover, so it must hold on average for the group.  \n\n### Appendix C  \n\n#### Weighting Variables  \n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{w}}_{b i j t}$ denote the log wage and $\\Delta w_{b i j t}$ the wage growth of person $b$ ， working in industry $_i$ in period $t_{\\perp}$ and in industry $j$ in period $t{\\bar{+}}1$ . The set of leavers from source industry $_i$ in period $t$ to target industry $j$ in $t$ $^{+1}$ is denoted $\\underset{\\cdot}{L}_{i j t},$ with $n_{i j t}^{L}$ denoting the number of leavers from $_i$ to $j$ when $_i$ is declining. $E_{i j t}$ is the set of entrants from source industry $_i$ in $t$ to target industry $j$ in $\\mathit{i}+1$ ,with $n_{i j t}^{E}$ denoting the number of entrants from $\\bar{i}$ to $j$ when $j$ is growing. For each period, let $S_{i t}$ denote the set of stayers in sourceindustry $i,$ and $n_{i t}^{S}$ the number of source stayers.And $G_{i}$ is the set of time periods $t$ for which employment in source industry $_i$ is growing. Analogous “target\" sets and numbers also apply.  \n\nEach entry in table 7 is one of the following weighted averages:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta w_{S}^{D}(i)\\equiv\\sum_{t}\\sum_{b}\\Theta_{i t}^{D}\\Delta w_{b i j b}\\mathrm{~where~}\\Theta_{i t}^{D}\\equiv\\frac{n_{i t}^{L}}{n_{i}^{L}+n_{i t}^{S}}\\forall t\\not\\in G_{i}\\wedge b\\in S_{i t},\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Delta w_{M}^{D}(i)\\equiv\\sum_{j}\\sum_{t}\\sum_{b}\\Theta_{i}^{D}\\Delta w_{b i j b}\\mathrm{where}\\Theta_{i}^{D}\\equiv\\frac{1}{n_{i}^{L}}\\forall j=i\\wedge t\\not\\in G_{i}\\wedge b\\in L_{i j t},\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Delta w_{T}^{D}(i)\\equiv\\sum_{j}\\sum_{t}\\sum_{b}\\Theta_{i j t}^{D}\\Delta w_{b i j t},\\mathrm{where}\\Theta_{i j t}^{D}\\equiv\\frac{n_{i j t}^{L}}{n_{i}^{L}+n_{j t}^{S}}\\forall j\\neq i\\land t\\not\\in G_{i}\\land b\\in S_{j t},\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\uptheta_{i j t}^{G}\\equiv\\frac{n_{i j t}^{E}}{n_{j}^{E}+n_{i t}^{S}}\\forall i\\neq j\\land t\\in G_{j}\\land b\\in S_{i t},\n$$  \n\n$\\Delta w_{M}^{G}(j)\\equiv\\sum_{i}\\sum_{t}\\sum_{b}\\Theta_{j}^{G}\\Delta w_{b i j b}\\mathrm{~where~}\\Theta_{j}^{G}\\equiv\\frac{1}{n_{j}^{E}}\\forall i\\neq j\\land t\\in G_{j}\\land b\\in E_{i j t},$ and  \n\n$$\n\\Delta w_{T}^{G}(j)\\equiv\\sum_{t}\\sum_{b}\\Theta_{j t}^{G}\\Delta w_{b i j b}\\mathrm{~where~}\\Theta_{j t}^{G}\\equiv\\frac{n_{j t}^{E}}{n_{j}^{E}+n_{j t}^{S}}\\forall t\\in G_{j}\\wedge b\\in S_{j v}\n$$  \n\nand each weighting variable $\\uptheta_{i j t}$ equals zero for observations not satisfying its respective “for all\" restriction. This implies that movers from a growing industry to a declining industry receive zero weight in each calculation.  \n\nIn principle, the same weights apply to the entries in tables 4 and 5; the estimators simply replace $\\Delta w_{b i j t}$ with ${w_{b i j t}}$ or $\\ w_{b i j,t+1}$ .However, the sample period in table 7 is longer, so the weights are not the same.  \n\n## References  \n\nAkerlof, George, and Yellen, Janet. “A Near Rational Model of the Business Cycle, with Wage and Price Inertia.\" Quarterly Journal of Economics 100, suppl.

Poulsen\", Mike Stegemoller “Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California Terry College of Business, University of Georgia Rawls College of Business, Texas Tech University  \n\n## Abstract  \n\nWe show that acquirer returns are significantly higher in stock-swap acquisitions of difficult-tovalue targets, as measured by R&D intensity and idiosyncratic return volatility. This finding contributes to an explanation of the determinants of, and value gains from, using stock as a method of payment. The effects of target-valuation uncertainty on both the method of payment and the market reaction to acquisitions are more likely to be apparent in samples of private acquisitions, and that these effects can be masked in samples of acquisitions of publicly held targets. Nevertheless, our results hold for publicly traded targets in multivariate analysis.  \n\nJEL classification: G34, G32  \n\nKeywords: Acquisitions; Private firms; Method of payment; Intangibles  \n\n### 1. Introduction  \n\nThree decades of evidence on takeovers of publicly traded targets by publicly traded acquirers demonstrates that such takeovers are at best wealth neutral for bidding firm stockholders, and potentially wealth destroying.? Recent evidence, however, identifies a subsample of takeover announcements that result in positive abnormal returns for acquiring firm stockholders: takeovers of targets that are not publicly listed (Chang, 1998; Fuller, Netter, and Stegemoller, 2002; Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz, 2004; and Faccio, McConnell, and Stolin, 2006). However, despite considerable investigation into the source of such gains, there is little understanding of why takeovers of non-public targets result in positive returns for acquirers while acquisitions of publicly traded targets do not.  \n\nParticularly compelling is the result that announcement returns are significantly negative on average when acquirers use stock to acquire publicly traded targets (Travlos, 1987), whereas the opposite is true for takeovers of privately held targets (Chang, 1998). A widely accepted rationale for the negative returns associated with stock payments for public targets is adverse selection: managers use stock as currency to pay for acquisitions only when that stock is overvalued.? A further puzzle, therefore, is why the method of payment is associated with such different valuation effects in acquisitions of public versus private firms.  \n\nIn this paper, we investigate the relation between the method of payment and acquirer returns. Importantly, we find that the method of payment affects acquirer announcement returns when a target is difficult to value irrespective of the target's public status. Specifically, acquirers in our sample of acquisitions garner higher announcement returns when they use stock to acquire targets with low levels of sales, when research and development (R&D) expenses exceed sales, or when the target's idiosyncratic return volatility is high. Even after controlling for other factors that have been found to affect acquirer returns, we find that acquirer announcement returns are significantly higher when acquirers use stock to acquire difficult-to-value targets.  \n\nThe finding that the method of payment has a significantly positive effect on acquirer announcement returns for acquisitions of firms that are difficult to value is suggestive of one of the causes of the method of payment effect that has puzzled researchers in this area. Specifically, this finding is most consistent with the notion that the method of payment affects acquirer returns because the use of a stock-swap mitigates information asymmetry about the target (Hansen, 1987). For example, the use of stock as a method of payment helps a publicly traded acquirer share the risk of a target's overvaluation with the target's owners. Conversely, when the acquirer pays with cash the acquirer bears all of the risk of overvaluation. Our evidence is consistent with the notion that there are gains from sharing the risk of overpayment with the target's owners.  \n\nWhile we also analyze public targets, our study focuses primarily on privately held targets for several reasons. First, and most importantly, there is likely to be substantially more information asymmetry concerning a privately held target's value (relative to a publicly traded target), because privately held companies are more opaque than publicly traded companies. This difference in information asymmetry suggests that this setting is one in which the information asymmetry problem concerning the target firm is both the greatest and the most lopsided in favor of the target. Second, takeovers of privately held firms are much less likely to elicit competing bids. This difference is mainly due to the Williams Act of 1968 that mandates disclosure and waiting periods for acquisition of publicly traded targets but does not apply to acquisitions of privately held firms. Third, Officer (2004) shows that in acquisitions of public firms the length of time between announcement and completion influences the method of payment choice. This consideration is generally less important in acquisitions of privately held firms as those acquisitions are typically announced only when completed. Thus, there are fewer factors affecting the method of payment decision in acquisitions of privately held targets and we, therefore, have a cleaner measure of the role of this choice.  \n\nIn sum, our results provide empirical support for the conjecture that the use of a stockswap mitigates information asymmetry about the target thereby increasing the returns to acquirers when there is substantial informational asymmetries about the value of the target. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In the following section, we describe our sample of acquisitions of both private and public companies and provide preliminary analysis of sample characteristics. Section 3 provides more complete empirical analysis of acquirer cumulative abnormal returns and their relation to target characteristics. Section 4 discusses the implications of our results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.  \n\n### 2. Sample construction and preliminary analysis  \n\nWe construct a sample of acquisitions of private companies from the Securities Data Corporation (SDC) Merger and Acquisitions database for our analysis of the anomalous announcement returns to acquirers of privately held target firms. In addition, we rely on two securities regulations that govern the financial reporting of acquisitions of private targets to gather financial data of the target firms. Regulation S-X states, “If securities are being registered to be offered to the security holders of the business to be acquired, the financial statements...shall be furnished for the business to be acquired... In general, the acquirer files the required information in an S-4 statement. In addition, if the takeover is a “material’ transaction, the acquirer must disclose details about the transaction in an 8-K. Depending on the transaction year and the method of payment, acquisitions that are $10\\%$ to $20\\%$ or more of the acquirer's total assets must file target financial statements since these transactions meet the level of materiality as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission.? We find the target's financial data in the following SEC filings of the acquirer: 8-Ks $(75.1\\%)$ , S-4s ( $18.0\\%)$ , S-1s $(3.4\\%)$ , proxy statements $(2.5\\%)$ , and S-3s $(1.0\\%)$  \n\nFrom an initial sample of 4,801 domestic, industrial, and private firms that are acquired from 1995 to 2004, we select those transactions that have deal value (total consideration paid by the acquirer) of $\\$50$ million or more and that are purchased by an acquirer traded on the NYSE, Nasdaq, or AMEX. There are 1,296 transactions that satisfy these criteria. The deal value is $10\\%$ or more of the acquirer's assets in 843 of these private acquisitions. We base our search for additional information about the target on these 843 acquisitions in which there is a higher probability that we will find target financial data in SEC filings. We exclude the transaction from our sample if in a reasonable period after the takeover announcement we do not find an 8-K or S4 describing the private target and the acquisition. We find 735 transactions that satisfy our data requirements and that have at least one year of audited financial data for the target.  \n\nOver the same time period of 1995 to 2004, we construct a sample of completed acquisitions of publicly traded targets. The acquirer in these takeovers must be a U.s. firm that has CRSP data in the month of the takeover and must have purchased $50\\%$ or more of the targets shares in the acquisition. Subsequent to the transaction, the acquirer must own $100\\%$ Of the target's shares. The target must have CRSP data in the month of the takeover, deal value of at least $\\$1$ million, and COMPUSTAT data for the year of the acquisition. These selection criteria result in 1,944 transactions of public acquirers purchasing public targets.  \n\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics on target and acquirer size, acquirer announcement cumulative abnormal returns (CARs), and acquirer market value dollar gains for our sample of acquisitions of privately held targets. (We focus on the private targets in our first four tables since there is comparatively less known about the characteristics of these private firms. While the overall conclusions of our paper apply to both private and public targets, we believe that informational asymmetries about firm value are most acute in these firms.) The announcement date of approximately $75\\%$ of the transactions in our sample of private targets is between 1995 and 2000. The average (median) acquirer market value of equity is $\\$3.2$ billion ( $\\$695$ million) and the average (median) target deal value is $\\$244$ million $\\$127$ million). Median acquirer and target size are largest in 2000 where the acquirer and target size is $\\$1.9$ billion and $\\$161$ million, respectively; the largest average acquirer and target size is $\\$7$ billion in 2000 and $\\$367$ million in 2001, respectively.  \n\nIn Columns 3 and 4 of Table 1, we report the acquirer market value dollar gain and the acquirer CAR. We measure the CAR from day $^{-1}$ to day $+1$ around the takeover announcement using the firm return minus the CRSP value-weighted market return. The acquirer's dollar gain is the product of the CAR and the acquirer's market value of equity five days prior to the announcement. In general, these deals increase the value of the acquirer: the average (median) dollar gain to the acquirer is $\\$21.2$ $(\\$9.3)$ million.  \n\nMoeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz (2004) find that larger acquirers earn average abnormal returns of about $2\\%$ less than smaller acquirers and suggest that there may be a hubris effect at work - larger acquirers tend to be overconfident about their acquisition strategies (Roll, 1986). Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz (2005) show that the large losses to a few acquirers in 1998 to 2001 are concentrated in very large firms that are significantly overvalued. We also find evidence of large loss deals similar to Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz (2005). In 2000 and 2001, the average dollar gain is $\\$142$ million and - $\\$94$ million, respectively. In 10 deals, the loss to the acquirer is more than $\\$1$ billion: eight of these are in 2000 and there is one each in 1999 and 2001.4 If we remove these deals from the sample, the average dollar gain for the remaining transactions is $\\$87.6$ million.  \n\nThe average acquirer CAR in our sample of acquisitions of privately held targets is $3.8\\%$ which, as in prior literature, is significantly different from zero at the $1\\%$ level. The average CAR for our sample is greater than the CARs found by Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz (2004) (they report an average acquirer CAR of $1.1\\%$ for private targets) or Fuller, Netter and Stegemoller (2002) (they report an average acquirer CAR of $2.1\\%$ ). However, there are large differences in target firm size between the studies. Moeller et al. and Fuller et al. require that the deal value be Only $\\$1$ million while we require a deal value of $\\$50$ million to increase the probability of finding financial data on the target. As a result, the samples in the other papers include many small firms where the impact on the acquirer may be substantively smaller since the acquired assets represent a smaller fraction of the acquiring firm. For example, Fuller et al. report that the average (median) deal value for private targets in their sample is $\\$69$ million ( $\\$18$ million) compared to $\\$244$ million ( $\\$127$ million) in our sample. Fuller et al. also report that acquirer CARs are positively related to deal value for acquisitions of private targets, consistent with our results.  \n\nOur analysis of CARs for the year 2000 provides additional evidence that this period is an unusual one. In 2000 prior to and including the market peak in March, there are 71 deals in our sample with a statistically significant average CAR of $4.3\\%$ . For the remainder of 2000, there are 78 transactions with an average CAR of $-0.4\\%$ . Thus, our data confirm previous findings that returns to acquirers of privately held targets are positive on average, though there are periods in which the deals are not as well received by the market.  \n\nIn Table 2, we present descriptive statistics for target characteristics that may contribute to the variation in acquirer CARs for acquisitions of privately held firms. More than $65\\%$ (483) of all acquirers in our sample use some stock as a method of payment, and in $38.8\\%$ of deals stock is the primary method of payment. We define the method of payment as “stock\" if at least $90\\%$ of the consideration paid for the target is acquirer stock. Changing the definition to “majority stock'\" (at least $50\\%$ ) or “completely stock’ $(100\\%)$ does not change the qualitative conclusions in this paper. The median fraction of stock used as a method of payment is $50\\%$ , and more than $25\\%$ of sample acquirers use stock as the sole currency in the acquisition.  \n\nIn untabulated results, we find evidence that the method of payment differs across acquisitions by the same acquirer. When we consider the acquisition immediately preceding and after our sample acquisition, we find that $25\\%$ of our sample acquirers change the amount of stock used in these transactions by $51\\%$ or more. This evidence is consistent with the notion that the characteristics of the target play a significant role in the acquirer's method-of-payment decision (Fuller, Netter, and Stegemoller, 2002). Contrary to the frequent use of stock, we find an infrequent use of earnouts in acquisitions of private firms $8.7\\%$ of sample). Thus, earnouts do not appear to be a common means of resolving information asymmetries in our sample of private takeovers (Cain, Denis, and Denis, 2006).  \n\nChang (1998) suggests that acquirer abnormal returns in stock-swap acquisitions of private firms are significantly positive because the payment of acquirer stock to the owners of the private target can form a new blockholder in the acquiring firm. Chang hypothesizes that this effect is related to the monitoring benefits associated with a new blockholder. In Chang's sample, $38\\%$ of acquisitions of privately held targets create a new blockholder in the acquirer. We determine blockholder formation - defined as an individual from the target holding $5\\%$ ormore of the equity in the merged firm - as follows. First, all transactions in which the method of payment is all cash or in which the product of the percentage stock used and the relative size of the transaction is less than $5\\%$ of the acquiring firm are determined to not form a blockholder. Second, all transactions in which the product of the following three variables is greater than $5\\%$ are assumed to form a new blockholder in the acquiring firm: the percentage holding of the largest individual blockholder of the target firm prior to the acquisition, the target ownership in the merged firm or, if target ownership is not available, the relative size of the target to the merged firm (target deal value plus the acquirer market value 5 days prior to the announcement)), and the percentage stock in the method of payment. Third, for the remainder of the deals for which we do not have target ownership data, we examine the most recent proxy statement of the acquiring firm after the completion of the transaction to determine whether a blockholder is formed from an owner of the target firm. In Table 2, we report the formation of a new blockholder in only $11.7\\%$ of our sample transactions.  \n\nTable 2 contains descriptive statistics for two variables based on target accounting data that we use to proxy for the difficulty of valuing the target at the time of the acquisition: a \"development stage” indicator variable and a continuous measure of the fraction of intangibles on the target firm's balance sheet (intangibles divided by total assets). The development stage indicator variable is equal to one if the target has sales of less than $\\$500,000$ Or if the firm's R&D expenditures exceed sales. There are 109 firms in our sample that satisfy at least one of these criteria. However, R&D expenditures exceeding sales almost entirely drives this development stage indicator variable: 101 targets have R&D expenditures greater than sales and just eight development stage targets only meet the requirement that sales are less than $\\$500,000$ .Our results do not significantly change by excluding these eight observations suggesting that our findings are driven by defining a development stage firm as one for which R&D expenditures exceed sales. We also reclassify a target as development stage (or not) according to the firm's previous year sales and R&D expenditures to control for the possibility that we spuriously identify development stage firms based on one year of accounting data. This reclassification yields 20 additional development stage firms and results in more significant findings than those reported.  \n\nAs a secondary proxy for the difficulty of target valuation that is available for most of our sample, we measure the amount of intangibles reported on the target firm's balance sheet. Table 2 shows that 295 firms $(40.1\\%)$ in our sample report a positive amount of intangibles; $25\\%$ of our private targets have intangibles exceeding $7.4\\%$ of total assets. As “intangibles” is a very broad accounting category, we document some facets of the intangibles reported by private targets in the Appendix. We are able to find a description of the intangibles in the notes to the private firm's financial statements for all but 15 sample firms reporting intangibles. The most often reported intangible is goodwill; it comprises, on average, $63\\%$ of intangibles and is the largest intangible for 187 out of the 280 c $(66.8\\%)$ private firms. Goodwill relates directly to the target's own acquisitions of firms that are themselves difficult to value, as the accumulation of goodwill through the acquisition process is dependent of the nature of assets and businesses acquired in prior transactions. The second most prominent category of intangibles (by proportion) is the value of employment contracts, customer agreements, advertising rights, network affiliations, and deferred pension assets (categorized as “Other”’ in the Appendix), closely followed by broadcasting rights. As demonstrated by the categorizations in the Appendix, the intangibles reported by private firms that are subsequently acquired would be difficult for both the acquirer and investors to accurately value.  \n\nWe experiment with other proxies for the difficulty in valuing the target's assets, including the age of the firm, whether a privately held target is covered in either Compustat or IBES, the impact of industry affiliation, and whether the bid for the private target is the first bid in the target's industry in the past year (as in Song and Walkling, 2005). None of these measures is reliably related to acquirer announcement returns. Age of the firm, for example, while intuitively appealing, may not adequately distinguish between the types of assets employed in the cross-section of firms - two firms of the same age can be in different businesses that entail considerably different amounts of uncertainty about future prospects.  \n\nTable 2 also reports statistics for the acquisition discount for private targets. Officer (2007) shows that privately held firms are acquired at a $15\\%$ to $30\\%$ discount relative to the average acquisition multiple paid for comparable publicly held targets. As greater acquisition discounts imply higher bidder announcement returns (all else equal, as illiquid assets are acquired \"cheap\"), it is important to control for the effect of the discount when explaining acquirer returns in acquisitions of privately held companies.  \n\nWe compute this discount by comparing the acquisition multiple for private targets to the average acquisition multiple in a porfolio of publicly traded targets of similar size, profitability, and line of business. Our measure is:  \n\n$$\n1-\\frac{X_{\\mathit{P V T,i}}}{\\overline{{X}}_{\\mathit{P U B,t-k}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $X_{P V T}$ is a valuation multiple for the private target and $X_{P U B}$ is the average valuation multiple from a portfolio of comparable publicly traded targets. This is the measure in Officer (2007) multiplied by $^{-1}$ , so that acquisition discounts will be positive numbers. We use the following four multiples: deal value to total assets, deal value to net income, deal value to EBITDA, and deal value to sales. The numerator of each multiple, deal value, is the total value of consideration paid by the acquirer, excluding fees and expenses. The denominator is collected from COMPUSTAT for the publicly traded targets and from SEC filings for the private targets.  \n\nThe portfolio of comparable public targets must be in the same Fama and French (1997) industry as the private target, have total assets within $60\\%$ of total assets for the target in the year prior to the acquisition announcement, and have similar levels of profitability (i.e., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization divided by total assets). We define “similar profitability”’ as (1) if the sample firm's profitability is negative, then so must the matched firm, and (2) if the sample firm's profitability is positive then the matched firm's profitability must be within $\\pm0.10$ . Similar to Officer (2007), we adjust the multiples for outliers: estimates smaller than $^{-1}$ are discarded from the sample (to be consistent with the implicit upper bound of $+1$ ).The discount we use is the equal-weighted average discount for each target firm computed using the multiples available for each private target (e.g., when the private target has negative EBITDA, only deal value to total assets and deal value to sales are used.)  \n\nWe are able to compute the discount measure for 404 firms in our sample. The median (average) discount is $17.4\\%$ $14\\%)$ . The loss of 331 firms from the sample for the parts of our analysis that rely on discount data is less extreme than the sample loss in Officer (2007) because much of our data for private targets is hand collected and therefore more carefully scrutinized.  \n\nIt is important to note that target accounting data is sometimes disclosed at the acquisition announcement date, but is more often disclosed later. While we condition our analysis of acquirer announcement CARs on information that may not be fully disclosed to the market at the announcement, it is reasonable to expect that market participants are at least partially informed about the nature of the target's business and its financial makeup at the acquisition announcement. This contention is consistent with untabulated results which show that acquirer CARs around the date on which the target's financials are fully disclosed to the market are statistically indistinguishable from zero on average. However, in unreported results, we find that if the target provides comprehensive disclosure prior to the acquisition announcement, then this disclosure substantially mitigates our principal results, which we believe are driven by uncertainty about the value of the target.  \n\nIn Table 3, we document target characteristics by industry affiliation. We base industry definitions  on the two-digit  SIC.  Approximately  half $(49.5\\%)$ of our sample firms are concentrated in the Business Services $(33.6\\%)$ and Machinery and Equipment Supply $(15.9\\%)$ industries. There are a relatively high percentage of firms in the development stage in the Business Services $(25.5\\%)$ and Machinery and Equipment Supply $(20.5\\%)$ industries, and the acquirers in these industries are two of the three most frequent users of stock as a method of payment $-61.5\\%$ and $45.3\\%$ , respectively. Further, seven of 13 industries have no development stage private firms; in six of the seven non-development-stage industries, fewer than $20\\%$ of the acquirers use stock as the primary method of payment, in five industries fewer than $10\\%$ of the acquirers use stock as the primary method of payment. Table 3 also demonstrates considerable variation in average intangibles across industries. Average scaled intangibles range from $0.6\\%$ in the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishery, and Mining industry to $22.6\\%$ in the Telecommunications industry.  \n\n### 3. The relation between acquirer CARs and proxies for the difficulty of valuing a target  \n\n#### 3.1. UNIVARIATE RESULTS  \n\nAs noted above, we employ two proxies for the difficulty of valuing a target: the development stage indicator variable and the fraction of intangibles on the target's balance sheet. Due to possible multiple interpretations of the level of intangibles, we focus on the development stage indicator variable in our regression analysis.? However, in our univariate results, we differentiate the sample on the basis of both measures for additional information about the impact of uncertainty. Table 4 contains average acquirer announcement CARs for sub-samples of our data based on these two proxies. Panel A demonstrates the interaction of the development stage indicator variable and the method of payment. Acquirers of targets in the development stage suffer statistically significant negative CARs of $-5.8\\%$ on average when stock is not the primary method of payment. The transactions accounting for these negative returns are diverse. The targets are primarily from the Business Services, Chemical and Petroleum, Telecommunications, and Machinery and Equipment Supply industries. Further, the acquirers and targets vary in size: acquirer size ranges from $\\$91$ million to $\\$232$ billion and target size ranges from $\\$50$ million to $\\$2$ billion.  \n\nConversely, for developmental targets, acquirers using stock for at least $90\\%$ of the consideration experience significantly positive CARs of $5.8\\%$ on average. When stock, rather than cash, is the primary method of payment, acquirers of development-stage targets earn more positive announcement returns; the difference is both statistically and economically significant. We find qualitatively identical results when we dissect the sample based on the level of the target's intangibles (Panel B). For targets reporting intangibles in excess of $10\\%$ of total assets, acquirer returns are significantly more positive when stock is used as the primary method of payment ( $10.3\\%$ on average) than when it is not ( $4.7\\%$ on average).  \n\nThis distinct difference in average acquirer announcement returns for targets that are difficult to value suggests that the effect of the method of payment on acquirer returns is the most pronounced when the information environment surrounding the target firm is the most opaque.  \n\nPrevious research (Travlos, 1987; Houston and Ryngaert, 1997) identifies an adverse selection consideration for acquiring firms that use equity for acquisitions. Analogous to Myers and Majluf (1984), extant research suggests that the negative relation between acquirer returns and stock as the method of payment in public acquisitions signals that acquiring firm managers with private information issue stock when it is overvalued. This negative impact should be more acute the more difficult it is to value the acquirer. In Table 5, we consider whether uncertainty about acquirer valuation affects the CAR for acquisitions of private companies when stock is the method of payment.  \n\nIn Panel A, of Table 5, we present a two-by-two matrix indicating whether the private target acquired with at least $90\\%$ equity is a development stage or non-development stage firm and whether the acquirer is more or less difficult to value. We proxy for the difficulty of valuation for acquiring firms with being above or below median acquirer idiosyncratic volatility, measured as the standard deviation of the market-adjusted residuals of daily stock returns from 205 days to 6 days prior to the announcement. We find no evidence that acquirer idiosyncratic volatility is associated with acquirer returns in this subsample with this test.  \n\nAs noted above, acquisitions of private targets provide a sample of takeovers in which there is considerable uncertainty about the value of the target firm. All else equal, the magnitude of valuation uncertainty should be less for public (relative to private) firms. However, the acquirer's mitigation of risk via the method of payment should have the same affect on acquirer announcement returns.  \n\nTherefore, we also consider a sample of 1,944 public targets. These public targets are substantially larger than private targets; the average public deal value is $\\$1.2$ billion as compared to $\\$244$ million in the private sample. Comparative acquirer returns are similar to those reported in the acquisition literature with average CAR in acquisitions of publicly traded firms equal to $1.26\\%$ (compared to $3.8\\%$ for the sample of acquisitions of private firms). The fact that these public targets follow SEC disclosure requirements leads to substantially more information availability about their assets, business operations, and growth prospects. However, due to the large size of these target firms, only $3\\%$ of these firms match our “development stage” criteria, having sales less than $\\$500,000$ or R&D greater than sales. Thus, we use target idiosyncratic return volatility to proxy for difficulty of valuation in this sample.  \n\nIn Panel B of Table 5, we repeat the two-by-two analysis for public targets acquired with equity. Of the 1,944 public acquisitions, 938 use at least $90\\%$ equity in the transaction. The results  show  significant evidence of the effect of information asymmetry on acquirer announcement returns in acquisitions of publicly traded targets. Specifically, the model in Hansen (1987) predicts that stock is more useful than cash in resolving information asymmetry when uncertainty or asymmetry is mostly about the target firm. We find that announcement returns for acquirers are significantly less negative when uncertainty about value, which we proxy for with idiosyncratic return volatility, is high for the target but low for the acquirer $(-1.7\\%)$ comparedto cases in which return volatility is high for both parties $(-4.2\\%)$ . As the table contains only stockswap offers, this result suggests that there is incremental value to the acquirer from a stock-swap offer when information asymmetry, or uncertainty, is greater about the target than the acquirer.  \n\nThat interpretation is somewhat undermined by the role of the target volatility in this sample. Specifically, acquirer announcement returns are not only significantly less negative when the acquisition involves a target (acquirer) with high (low) uncertainty about valuation (as predicted in the Hansen (1987) model), but also when the reverse is true (the acquirer has above median, and the target below median, return volatility). This latter result is not consistent with our hypothesis or the Hansen model, but perhaps reflects the inappropriateness of a stock-swap offer in acquisitions of publicly traded firms when both acquirer and target have more uncertainty about their intrinsic values.  \n\nThe remainder of this section provides multivariate tests of these basic results, and Section 4 offers a discussion of potential interpretations of our findings.  \n\n#### 3.2. MULTIVARIATE RESULTS  \n\nTable 6, Panel A presents the results of our multivariate regressions for private acquisitions. The dependent variable in all regressions is the acquirer's CAR, as defined in Table 1. We report the results from five diferent models. The first two regressions employ the full sample of acquisitions of privately held firms.α The results of the first two regressions in Table 6 support our univariate findings, as the development stage indicator variable has significantly positive coefficients when interacted with the stock indicator variable. We change the stock variable from an indicator ( $90\\%$ stock equals one, otherwise equal to zero) to a continuous variable in regression (2) and find an increase in both the size of the coefficient and the level of significance of our interaction term (Development stage \\* Stock). This result suggests that acquirers experience the most positive announcement CARs when buying development-stage firms using stock as a method of payment. In unreported results, we use alternative levels of equity funding, ranging from $50\\%$ to $100\\%$ , with no substantive changes in our results.  \n\nWe include several control variables in our regressions as suggested by existing research focusing on acquirer returns. Relative size has a significantly positive coefficient in both regressions, while the blockholder indicator variable, acquirer market value, and acquirer Q are insignificant in both full-sample specifications. Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz (2007) find a negative relation between announcement returns for acquirers of public firms using stock-swaps and acquirer idiosyncratic return volatility. They suggest that this volatility serves as a proxy for information asymmetry about the acquirer (in contrast to our focus on proxies for the difficulty of valuing the target). We find that acquirer idiosyncratic return volatility has little predictive power for acquirer average announcement CARs in our analysis and is actually positive and significant athe $10\\%$ level in regression (2). Interestingly, there is no significant relation between acquirer CARs and acquirer size in our sample (contrary to the findings in Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz, 2004, for a more general sample of acquisitions). We also include variables indicating whether the target or the acquirer is a dotcom company. In general, these variables are insignificant.  \n\nRegressions (3) through (5) vary the basic specification in the first column of Table 6. Because privately held firms are typically much smaller than publicly traded acquirers, the results in the first two regressions in Table 6 could be affected by the inclusion of acquisitions of very small targets by very large acquirers for which the value impact of the acquisition (as measured by the announcement CAR) is likely to be small. Thus, regression (3) replicates the specification in regression (1) using only those transactions in which the value of the target firm is at least $20\\%$ of the acquirer's market value. The coefficient on the interaction of the development stage variable with the stock indicator is of substantially greater magnitude in regression (3) (doubling in size) and statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. This difference suggests that the effect of the method of payment for R&D-intensive targets on acquirer CARs is much more pronounced when the acquisition could be expected to have the greatest value consequences for the acquiring firm. The acquirer's $\\mathsf Q$ is significantly positive in regression (3), consistent with Lang, Stulz and Walking's (1989) analysis of public targets, as is the indicator variable for blockholder formation, consistent with Chang (1998). However, the evidence for acquirer Q and blockholder formation is weak since it is only significant in this model in which we examine relatively large targets.  \n\nRegression (4) incorporates the acquisition discount measure, resulting in a loss of sample size. Controlling for the target's valuation discount is important in this context, since acquirer returns could be driven by the ability of acquirers to purchase privately held targets at a discount (Officer, 2007). Regression (4) demonstrates this explanation (the coefficient on the discount variable is positive and significant at the $5\\%$ level), and that the interaction of acquiring a developing firm using stock as the method of payment still produces significantly more positive acquirer announcement CARs even after controlling for the private acquisition discount.  \n\nRegression (5) presents results that control for the potential endogeneity of the method of payment choice. While regressions (1) through (4) demonstrate that acquirers earn a significantly more positive return when offering stock to an R&D intensive target, the target characteristics themselves (i.e., R&D intensity) could influence the acquirer's method-of-payment choice. For example, Hansen (1987) presents a model in which the acquirer protects itself against potential overpayment for the target firm by offering its own stock as a method of payment, and such “\"lemons” protection would seemingly be more valuable in acquisitions of privately held firms with considerable valuation uncertainty.  \n\nTherefore, the regression in column (5) is the second stage of a two-stage approach to controlling for endogeneity. This method is similar to that of Heckman (1979); however, we actually observe the endogenous variable in the second stage, thus we use a two-stage treatment model.1° Specifically, in the first-stage probit regression (Panel B of Table 6) the endogenous variable (stock) is regressed against potential explanatory variables. The second stage model is regression (5) in Panel A of Table 6. If $\\uplambda$ (the product of the correlation between the error terms of the two equations and the standard error of the outcome regression) is not different from zero, then we can conclude that endogeneity does not play a significant role in our model.  \n\nTurning first to the first-stage probit in Panel B of Table 6, the significant explanatory variables for the method of payment choice are the variable indicating whether the firm is in the development stage, acquirer Q, and the acquirer CAR in the 12 months prior to the acquisition announcement. Acquirers are more likely to offer stock as a method of payment to the owners of privately held target firms when the target is in the development stage and when the value of that stock is high relative to book value.  \n\nThe lack of significance in the second-stage regression (regression (5) in Panel A) of the coefficient on $\\uplambda$ indicates that it may not be important to control for endogeneity in this context. In the treatment model, the interaction of the development stage indicator variable and stock as a method of payment is again significantly positive, confirming that the key result in Panel A holds even after controlling for possible endogeneity of the method of payment choice.  \n\nIn untabulated results, we explore the relation between earnout use and acquirer CARs. Earnouts can be used as an alternate contractual device to resolve valuation uncertainty in settings in which the information environment surrounding the target is opaque (Cain, Denis, and Denis, 2006), since an earnout allows the payment from the acquirer to the former owners of the privately held target to be conditional on future performance of the target-firm's business. Regardless of the specification, there is no statistically significant relation between earnout use and acquirer announcement CAR in our sample.  \n\nIn Table 7, we repeat the analysis of Table 6 for acquisitions of public targets. In column (1), we report the regression using whether the target is a development stage company as our measure of uncertainty. In regression (2), we use the idiosyncratic volatility of the target's stock return as the measure of uncertainty. In both of these regressions, we proxy for the use of stock with an indicator variable equal to one if the acquirer uses $90\\%$ stock or more in the acquisition. In the regression in column (3), the independent variable “stock” is continuous.  \n\nOur basic finding that acquirer returns are greater when stock is used in the acquisition of targets with uncertain valuation is confirmed in this sample. When using the development stage indicator, or when entering stock as a continuous variable, the measure of uncertainty interacted with the use of stock is positive and significantly different from zero. In this sample, we also confirm the findings of Travlos (1987) and Houston and Ryngaert (1997) that acquirer returns are more negative when stock is used by acquirers with more uncertain valuation, consistent with the expectation that the use of stock may be indicative of adverse selection.  \n\n### 4. Discussion  \n\nSection 3 demonstrates, in both univariate and multivariate settings, that acquirers have significantly higher abnormal announcement returns when they use stock to acquire opaque and difficult-to-value targets (i.e., those with R&D expenses exceeding sales, sales less than $\\$500,000$ , or high idiosyncratic return volatility). These results are consistent with theoretical predictions about negotiating an acquisition in the presence of both adverse selection and information asymmetry.  \n\nHansen (1987) suggests that acquiring firms can protect themselves against the cost of buying a “lemon\" by offering target shareholders a contingent pricing contract that at least partly offsets any overpayment revealed ex post.\" The sub-samples of privately held target firms that we identify as being difficult to value are target firms for which considerable information asymmetry or uncertainty is likely to exist about the value of the target's assets and opportunities, as R&D- and intangibles-intensive firms are highly speculative.  \n\nThus, our results are consistent with the notion that acquirer returns around acquisition announcements reflect the gains derived from the sharing of valuation risk with target shareholders via a stock swap when there is considerable information asymmetry about the target's value. Hansen's (1987) theoretical analysis provides specific assumptions that support such a conclusion. Specifically, Proposition 1 in Hansen (1987) demonstrates that the expected wealth gain for acquirer shareholders from a stock-swap acquisition strictly exceeds the expected wealth gain for acquirer shareholders from an equivalent cash acquisition if there is information asymmetry only about the target's value (and the target is reasonably large relative to the acquirer'?). Intuitively, because a stock-swap offer allows former target shareholders to participate in future wealth gains in the merged firm, an acquirer can convince target shareholders to sell at a relatively lower price in a stock-swap offer relative to making a cash-only offer for the target firm. A stock-swap offer thereby resolves the information asymmetry problem that restricts trade when cash-only offers are employed.  \n\nTherefore, our empirical findings are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model in Hansen (1987), under the (arguably reasonable) assumption that information asymmetry mostly concerns the target (at least relative to the acquirer) in acquisitions of privately held firms. However, the empirical literature does not frequently employ the “wealth gain” predictions of the Hansen (1987) model - this model is most frequently cited as a theoretical reference for the method of payment choice. If we are to rely on the wealth gain predictions from Hansen (1987) (e.g., Proposition 1), therefore, it is incumbent on us to provide some evidence that acquirers choose the “correct” (or predicted) method of payment in a contracting situation potentially fraught with information asymmetry. In our sample, $79\\%$ of acquirers of informationally-opaque private companies'3 use stock as the primary method of payment, providing support to the contention that stock is the optimal method of payment when the acquirer faces considerable information asymmetry about the value of the target's assets and opportunities. However, this fact begs the question: why do the other $21\\%$ of acquirers use cash as the method of payment?  \n\nThere are several factors unrelated to information asymmetry (and therefore omitted from Hansen's model) that can affect the method of payment in the acquisition of a private company. Target shareholders frequently regard an acquisition of their privately held firm as an opportunity to obtain liquidity (Faccio and Masulis, 2005; and Poulsen and Stegemoller, 2007).14 In some instances, target owners are willing to reduce their selling price in exchange for immediate liquidity thereby inducing the acquirer to substitute optimal contracting (stock as the method of payment) for lower pricing (Officer, 2007). Acquirers will also deviate from the optimal method of payment predicted in Hansen's model, even in the face of information asymmetry about the target firm, for control-related reasons. As Amihud, Lev, and Travlos (1990) demonstrate, in a relatively large stock-swap acquisition in which there is a potential dilution of control of the acquirer's dominant shareholders, the acquirer has an incentive to use a non-voting method of payment that will not reduce the control of shareholders already in place.  \n\nWe observe that acquiring-firm managers often pay cash to avoid relinquishing control even though cash is the “suboptimal’ method of payment under asymmetric information in two ways. First, we examine deals in our sample of 735 acquisitions of privately held firms that would have resulted in a blockholder (a shareholder of at least $5\\%$ ) in the acquiring firm had stock been the method of payment. We can identify the largest individual owner for 55 acquisitions of privately held targets in which the acquirer did not use any stock as a method of payment. If these transactions had been stock-swaps (the method of payment being $100\\%$ stock), then the largest individual owner in 26 deals $(47.3\\%)$ would have become a $5\\%$ blockholder in the acquiring firm. For comparison, of 122 actual stock-swaps for which we can identify the largest individual target owner, only $30.3\\%$ (37) created a blockholder in the acquiring firm. Second, we consider the interaction of the method of payment and ownership levels of acquiring-firm officers. For acquisitions of privately held targets in which the relative size of the target to the acquirer is greater than $20\\%$ and acquiring-firm officers own $5\\%$ or more of the acquirer, cash is preferred to stock as the method of payment by a 1.75-to-1 ratio. For the same level of officer ownership, but for transactions in which the relative size is less than $20\\%$ , stock is preferred to cash by a 2.5-to-1 ratio. Thus, there is evidence that one motive for using cash is to avoid diluting control, despite its disadvantage in informationally-opaque environments.  \n\nTherefore, we interpret our results as consistent with acquirers trading off the benefits and costs of the two main methods of payment (cash and stock) for privately held targets. If target shareholder liquidity and acquirer shareholder control considerations are not important, the model in Hansen (1987) predicts that acquirers will use stock as the method of payment. Our findings suggest that acquirer announcement returns reflect the gains from sharing some of the valuationrisk with target shareholders by making a stock-swap offer for a difficult-to-value target.  \n\nMore broadly, the positive acquirer returns from stock-swap acquisition offers shown here are likely to be prevalent in acquisitions of both public and private targets. However, confounding factors surround acquisitions of public firms , and these factors appear to make the announcement returns to stock swap acquirers of public firms (negative or zero) different from the announcement returns to stock swap acquirers of private firms (significantly positive). For example, proposed acquisitions of public firms are typically announced 9 to 12 months prior to completion, confounding the interpretation of announcement returns as a clean measure of the value of the acquisition to the acquirer, and it is much more likely that the information asymmetry problem is more evenly distributed between the two parties when one publicly traded firm acquires another. One way to interpret the findings in this paper is that samples of acquisitions of private firms offer an ideal laboratory for Hansen's (1987) model, as the information asymmetry problem is the most lopsided with respect to the target and returns are the cleanest measure of the value of the acquisition to the acquirer. Therefore, the effects we identify (positive announcement returns to stock-swap acquirers of opaque targets) are likely to be obscured by other factors in samples of acquisitions of publicly held firms, making the announcement returns to acquirers of privately held firms appear anomalous. Despite these obscuring factors, we find support for our hypothesis in a sample of publicly traded targets.  \n\n### 5. Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper, we document significantly and substantially higher announcement returns to stock-swap acquirers when the target is difficult to value. The empirical relations that we identify are most likely to be observed in samples of acquisitions of privately held firms because information asymmetry between the negotiating parties and market participants is more likely to be one sided (relative to acquisitions of publicly traded firms). However, we confirm the importance of the difficulty of valuation in a sample of public targets also, despite the fact that many offsetting considerations make it more dificult to observe the impact on acquirer returns in isolation.  \n\nOne way to interpret our results is in the context of Hansen's (1987) model of information asymmetry: there is a reward to acquirers for using stock as the acquisition currency when the target's assets and operations are difficult to value. Furthermore, the positive relation between acquirer returns and proxies for the opacity of the target's value when stock is the method of payment is the most pronounced in the portion of our sample for which the target's financials are not publicly disclosed at the time of the acquisition. In other words, acquirer returns are most positive when the acquirer uses a contingent method of payment (stock) for targets possessing characteristics (R&D- or intangibles-intensity) that would result in market participants finding it difficult to assess the benefit of the acquisition to the acquirer. In this case, using stock to acquire the target mitigates concerns about overpayment by the acquirer. Importantly, we confirm this result when we control for other considerations through multivariate analysis in a sample of public targets using the idiosyncratic risk of the target firm as a measure of uncertainty.  \n\n## References  \n\nAmihud, Y., B.

All acquirers are publicly traded firms listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq, or AMEX. Column (1) is the acquirer's market value of equity $(\\$1n's)$ for the acquirer five days prior to the acquisition. Column (2) is the deal value of the target as listed in SDC $(\\$1n's)$ , measured as the total value of the consideration paid by the acquirer, excluding fees and expenses. Dollar gain is described in column (3) and is the product of CAR and acquirer market value of equity. Column (4)presents mean cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) by year in which the takeover announcement occurs. CAR is the firm return minus the CRSP value-weighted market return for the period $^{-1}$ to $+1$ , where O is the takeover announcement date. Column (5) presents the number of observations per year'\\*, or denotestaisial significanceathe $1\\%$ $5\\%$ or $10\\%$ level (respectively). Means are the first number represented, and medians are in brackets.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(1) Acquirer market value</td><td>(2) Target deal value</td><td>(3) Dollar Gain</td><td>(4) CAR</td><td>(5) N</td></tr><tr><td>1995</td><td>727 [350]</td><td>169 [123]</td><td>39.6 [5.7]</td><td>3.6%a [2.5%]</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>1,467 [568]</td><td>185 [115]</td><td>16.8 [15.2]</td><td>3.1%a [2.4%]</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>2,569 [483]</td><td>173 [94]</td><td>1.1 [12.3]</td><td>4.7%a [2.7%]</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>951 [513]</td><td>179 [117]</td><td>31.7 [16.9]</td><td>6.1%a [4.4%]</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>4,790 [936]</td><td>367 [136]</td><td>288.6 [5.5]</td><td>5.5%a [1.0%]</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>7,021 [1,877]</td><td>332 [161]</td><td>-141.6 [3.8]</td><td>1.9% [1.0%]</td><td>149</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>3,613 [533]</td><td>196 [135]</td><td>-94.4 [4.4]</td><td>1.9% [1.5%]</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>1,394 [620]</td><td>214 [133]</td><td>55.5 [7.0]</td><td>2.0% [1.3%]</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>2003 2004</td><td>969 [522] 921</td><td>160 [116] 248</td><td>36.6 [23.0] 4.6</td><td>6.7%a [3.8%]</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[738]</td><td>[177]</td><td>[2.2]</td><td>1.2% [0.6%]</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>All</td><td>3,195 [695]</td><td>244 [127]</td><td>21.2 [9.3]</td><td>3.8%a [2.4%]</td><td>735</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n#### Table 2: Descriptive statistics of target firm characteristics  \n\nThis table presents a description of privately-held target firm characteristics. Stock is equal to one if the method of payment is at least $90\\%$ stock. Blockholder is an indicator variable equal to one if an individual owner of the target has a $5\\%$ or greater ownership stake in the newly merged firm. Development stage is equal to one if the target firm has sales of less then $\\$500,000$ Or if the firm's research and development expenditures exceed sales. Intangibles is intangibles from the balance sheet divided by total assets. Earnout is equal to one if any portion of method of payment is an earnout. Discount is based on the excess of the average public acquisition multiple over the same private acquisition multiple (deal value to total assets, deal value to net income, deal value to EBITDA, and deal value to sales) for industry-, size-, and profitability-matched portfolios of publicly traded targets from the sample of public acquisitions in Table 5. The portfolio of comparable public acquisitions for each private target is all publicly traded target firms on Compustat in the same industry (Fama and French, 1997) as the private target and with total assets within $20\\%$ of total assets for the target in the year prior to the acquisition attempt. Because of outliers in the acquisition multiple data, discount estimates are truncated: estimates smaller than $^{-1}$ are discarded from the sample. The average multiples-based discount is the equallyweighted average of the discount for each target firm computed using the number of multiples available for each private target (i.e., if the private target has negative EBITDA, then only the deal value to total assets and deal value to sales multiples are used).  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>25\" percentile</td><td> 50\" percentile</td><td> 75\" percentile</td><td># (%) of total observations</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>285 (38.8%)</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage paid with stock</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.500</td><td>1.000</td><td>483 (65.7%)</td></tr><tr><td>Earnout</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>64 (8.7%)</td></tr><tr><td>Blockholder</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>86 (11.7%)</td></tr><tr><td>Development stage</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>109 (14.8%)</td></tr><tr><td>Sales ($ millions)</td><td>6.9</td><td>36.5</td><td>100.5</td><td>711 (96.7%)*</td></tr><tr><td>R&D / sales</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.236</td><td>331 (45.0%) **</td></tr><tr><td>Intangibles</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.074</td><td>295 (40.1%)</td></tr><tr><td>Discount</td><td>-0.161</td><td>0.174</td><td>0.517</td><td>404 (55.0%)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n64 firms have sales of less than $\\$500,000$ \\* 101 firms have research and development expenditures greater than revenues.  \n\n#### Table 3: Target firm characteristics by industry  \n\nThis table presents a subset of variables from Table 2 describing the method of payment and target firm characteristics.

Relative size is the ratio of target deal value to acquirer market value 5 days prior to bid announcement. Acquirer volatility is defined in the legend of Table 5. Acquirer $Q$ is the market value of the acquiring firm (the market value of equity plus the book value of the firm's debt) scaled by the total assets of the acquirer. Acquirer (Target) is a dotcom is a binary variable equal to one if the acquirer (target) has a “.com\" in the company's name. The definitions to the remaining independent variables are in the legend of Table 2. Regression (2) uses a continuous variable for Stock as opposed to the other regressions where Stock is a binary variable equal to one when the method of payment is comprised of at least $90\\%$ stock. Regression (3) removes all acquisitions where the target value is less than $20\\%$ of the acquirer market value 5 days prior to the takeover announcement. The regression (5) applies a treatment model to regression (3) to allow for the possibility of the method of payment being endogenously determined. The independent variables of the selection equation (in Panel B) include Year $-I$ abnormal return, which is measured using the firm return minus the CRSP value-weighted market return for the period -12 to -1, where 0 is the month of the takeover announcement. Year and industry fixed effects based on two-digit SIC codes are included, but not reported, in every regression in Panels A and B. Standard errors are reported in brackets, and a, ′, or indicates that the coefficient is statistically significantly different from zero at the $1\\%$ $5\\%$ ,or $10\\%$ level (respectively).

To study contemporary discrimination, we conducted a field experiment in the low-wage labor market of New York City, recruiting white, black, and Latino job applicants who were matched on demographic characteristics and interpersonal skills. These applicants were given equivalent résumés and sent to apply in tandem for hundreds of entry-level jobs. Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer. In fact, black and Latino applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison. Additional qualitative evidence from our applicants’ experiences further illustrates the multiple points at which employment trajectories can be deflected by various forms of racial bias. These results point to the subtle yet systematic forms of discrimination that continue to shape employment opportunities for low-wage workers.  \n\nDespite legal bans on discrimination and the liberalization of racial attitudes since the 1960s, racial differences in employment remain among the most enduring forms of economic inequality. Even in the tight labor market of the late 1990s, unemployment rates for black men remained twice that for whites. Racial inequality in total joblessness—including those who exited the labor market--increased among young men during this period (Holzer and Offner 2001). Against this backdrop of persistent racial inequality, the question of employment discrimination has generated renewed interest. Although there is much research on racial disparities in employment, the contemporary relevance of discrimination remains widelycontested.  \n\nOne line of research points to the persistence of prejudice and discrimination as a critical factor shaping contemporary racial disparities (Darity and Mason 1998; Roscigno et al. 2007). A series of studies relying on surveys and in-depth interviews finds that firms are reluctant to hire young minority men—-especially blacks—-because they are seen as unreliable, dishonest, or lacking in social or cognitive skills (Holzer 1996; Kirschenman and Neckerman 1991; Moss and Tilly 2001; Waldinger and Lichter 2003; Wilson 1996: chap. 5). The strong negative attitudes expressed by employers suggest that race remains highly salient in employers’ evaluations of workers. At the same time, research relying on interviews with employers leaves uncertain the degree to which self-reported attitudes are influential in actual hiring decisions (Pager and Quillian 2005). Indeed, Moss and Tilly  \n\n(2001:151) report the puzzling finding that “businesses where a plurality of managers complained about black motivation are more likely to hire black men.\" In fact, across a series of analyses controlling for firm size, starting wage, the percent black in the relevant portion of the metropolitan area, and a business's average distance from black residents in the area, Moss and Tilly find that employers who overtly criticize the hard skills or interaction skills of black workers are between two and four times more likely to hire a black worker (pp.151-52). Hiring decisions, of course, are influenced by a complex range of factors, racial attitudes being only one. Employers’ stated preferences do not provide a clear picture of the degree to which negative attitudes about blacks translate into active forms of discrimination.  \n\nResearch focusing on wages rather than employment offers even less evidence of contemporary discrimination. Neal and Johnson (1996), for example, estimate wage differences between white, black, and Latino young men. They find that two thirds of the black-white gap in wages in 1990 to 1991 can be explained by race differences in cognitive test scores measured 11 years earlier, and test scores fully explain wage differences between whites and Latinos. This and similar studies trace the employment problems of young minority men primarily to skill or other individual deficiencies, rather than any direct effect of discrimination (Farkas and Vicknair 1996; Neal and Johnson 1996; O'Neill 1990). Heckman (1998:101-102) puts the point most clearly, writing that “most of the disparity in earnings between blacks and whites in the labor market of the 1990s is due to differences in skills they bring to the market, and not to discrimination within the labor market.\" He goes on to describe labor market discrimination as “the problem of an earlier era.\"  \n\nDoes employer discrimination continue to affect labor market outcomes for minority workers? Clear answers are elusive because discrimination is hard to measure. Without observing actual hiring decisions, it is difficult to assess exactly how and under what conditions race shapes employer behavior. We address this issue with a field experiment that allows direct observation of employer decision making. By presenting equally qualified applicants who differ only by race or ethnicity, we can observe the degree to which racial considerations affect real hiring decisions. Furthermore, we move beyond experimental estimates of discrimination to explore the processes by which discrimination occurs. Examining the interactions between job seekers and employers, we gain new insights into how race influences employers’ perceptions of job candidate quality and desirability. Studying the multifaceted character of discrimination highlights the range of decisions that collectively reduce opportunities for minority candidates.  \n\n## CONCEPTUALIZING DISCRIMINATION  \n\nEmpirical studies often portray discrimination as a single decision. Research on employment disparities, for example, considers the role of discrimination at the point of initial hire; research on pay disparities considers discrimination at the point of wage-setting decisions. In reality, discrimination may occur at multiple decision points across the employment relationship. In this way, even relatively small episodes of discrimination—-when experienced at multiple intervals or across multiple contexts—can have substantial effects on aggregate outcomes.  \n\nDepictions of discriminators also often portray the labor market as divided neatly between employers with a “taste for discrimination” and those who are indifferent to race (Becker 1957). Consequently, it is suggested, job seekers can avoid discrimination by sorting themselves into sectors of the labor market where discrimination is less likely to occur (Heckman 1998:103). Fryer and Levitt (2003:5) characterize employers according to a similar dichotomy, with applicants best advised to identify and avoid employers prone to discrimination, rather than wasting time pursuing job opportunities among firms unwilling to hire them: \\*“In the face of discriminatory employers, it is actually in the interest of both employee and employers for Blacks to signal race, either via a name or other résumé information, rather than undertaking a costly interview with little hope of receiving a job offer.?’ According to this conceptualization of labor market discrimination, racial preferences or biases are fixed and concentrated among a specific subset of employers.  \n\nOther evidence challenges this tidy distinction between employers who do and do not discriminate. Alternative formulations of labor market discrimination encourage us to view the process as more interactive, contextual, and widespread. Theories of both statistical discrimination and stereotypes view race as a heuristic employers use to evaluate job applicants about whom little is known. Here, group-based generalizations provide guidance about the expected profile of individuals from a given group and facilitate decision making when information or time are scarce (Aigner and Cain 1977; Fiske 1998). Heuristics of this kind are pervasive (and often unconscious). Their effects may vary depending on the availability of and attention to person-specific information (such as that conveyed through application materials or in an interview) that may interact with and potentially override initial expectations.  \n\nA long line of social psychological research investigates how stereotypes give way to individualizing information, as well as the conditions under which stereotypes demonstrate a stubborn resistance to change (Bodenhausen 1988; Fiske 1998; Trope and Thomson 1997).1 This research suggests that salient personalizing information can quickly counteract stereotyped expectations; however, in evaluating difficult-to-observe or ambiguously relevant characteristics, or when decision makers have competing demands on their attention, stereotypes often filter information in ways that preserve expectations (Darley and Gross 1983; Dovidio and Gaertner 2000; Gilbert and Hixon 1991). In these cases of decision making under uncertainty, racial preferences or biases are unlikely to be expressed in any static or uniform way, but will vary in intensity and consequence depending on other characteristics of the applicant, the employer, and the interaction between the two.  \n\nIn addition to noting the varying role of race across employment interactions, some research shifts the focus from employer characteristics to the characteristics of the job for which a given worker is being considered. Previous research points to the negative consequences of the changing composition of low-wage jobs for black men, with the shift from manufacturing to services skewing the distribution of skill demands toward “soft skills,”’ for which black men are considered lacking (Moss and Tilly 2001). Jobs involving customer service or contact with clients heighten the salience of race because of employers’ concerns about the dress and demeanor of young black men (Moss and Tilly 2o01). Jobs at the “back of the house” or those emphasizing manual skills are less likely to activate concerns of this kind. In this scenario, discrimination may obtain not at the employer level but at the job level, with black applicants excluded from some job types and channeled into others. In this case, we would look to variation in discrimination not among employers but among the job openings for which workers are being considered.  \n\nRather than viewing discrimination as a single decision, or as the result of a small group of highly prejudiced employers, a growing body of research points to the variable contexts that shape how information about applicants may be filtered and interpreted along racial lines. Decision making under uncertainty and the race-typing of jobs both make discrimination more likely. To capture the contingent and cumulative effects of discrimination implied by these theories requires an examination of how experiences of discrimination may be distributed across a wide range of decision points and may vary depending on interactions among the employer, the applicant, and the job in question.  \n\n## THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF LOW-WAGELABOR MARKETS  \n\nEconomic theory predicts the decline of discrimination through market competition (Becker 1957), but several features of contemporary low-wage labor markets may sustain or renew racialized decision making. Shifts in the composition of both low-wage jobs and workers have potentially created new incentives and opportunities for employers to enact racial preferences in hiring. First, low-wage job growth is concentrated in service industries, in positions that place a heavy emphasis on self-presentation, interaction with customers, and other personality-related attributes (Moss and Tilly 2001). As discussed earlier, employers consistently express concerns over the “soft skills\" of black men, implying a potential skills mismatch between the skill requirements of new job growth and the perceived skill profile of black male job seekers. Furthermore, because many of the qualities valued by employers for contemporary low-wage jobs are difficult to evaluate from a written application or brief meeting, generalized negative perceptions of minority workers may be more difficult for individual minority applicants to disconfirm (Biernat and Kobrynowicz 1997).  \n\nSecond, low-wage labor markets today are characterized by increasing heterogeneity of the urban minority work force, with low-skill black workers now more likely to compete with other minority groups—in particular, low-skill Latino workers. Interviews with employers in Los Angeles and Chicago suggest consistent preferences for Latinos over blacks, with Latino workers viewed as more pliant, reliable, and hard-working (Kirschenman and Neckerman 1991; Waldinger and Lichter 2003). Given these racial preferences among employers, growing competition within the low-wage labor market may leave black men vulnerable to discrimination relative not only to whites, but to Latinos as well.  \n\nFinally, low-wage labor markets are increasingly supplied by workers with criminal records. Nearly a third of black men without a college degree have prison records by their mid-30s, adding to employers’ reservations about black male job applicants (Pager 2007b; Pettit and Western 2004). The high rate of incarceration makes a criminal record a newly important source of stigma that is worth studying in its own right. Moreover, we can view a criminal record as an extreme and authoritative signal of the kinds of problematic behaviors that employers ascribe to young black men. In this context, separating the effects of criminal stigma from race provides a useful benchmark for measuring racial stigma. In the first effort in this direction, Pager's (2003) research in a Milwaukee field experiment compared racial and criminal stigma among matched pairs of job seekers. Fielding a pair of black and a pair of white job applicants (in which one member of each pair was randomly assigned a criminal record), Pager found that a black applicant with no criminal background experiences job prospects similar to those of a white felon. That blackness confers the same disadvantage as a felony conviction helps calibrate the deeply skeptical view of young black men in the eyes of Milwaukee employers.  \n\nThe growing importance of soft skills, ethnic heterogeneity, and job seekers with criminal records suggest the persistence or increasing incidence of discrimination in contemporary low-wage labor markets. Whether based on statistical generalizations or inaccurate stereotypes, preconceived notions about the characteristics or desirability of black men relative to other applicant types are likely to structure the distribution of opportunity along racial lines.  \n\n## METHODSFORSTUDYINGLABORMARKETDISCRIMINATION  \n\nRacial discrimination in the labor market is typically studied by comparing the wages of whites and minorities, statistically controlling for human capital characteristics. Estimates from a variety of social surveys suggest that the black-white difference in hourly wages among men usually range between about 10 and 20 percent (Cancio, Evans, and Maume 1996; Darity and Meyers 1998; Neal and Johnson 1996). Although widely used, this residual method, in which discrimination is defined as the unexplained race difference in wages, is sensitive to the measurement of human capital. Where race differences in human capital are incompletely observed, the effect of discrimination may be overestimated (Farkas and Vicknair 1996; Neal and Johnson 1996).  \n\nResidual estimates of discrimination infer employer behavior from data on workers’ wages. Field experiments, by contrast, offer a more direct approach to the measurement of discrimination. This approach, also referred to as an audit methodology, involves the use of matched teams of job applicants—called testers—who apply to real job openings and record responses from employers. Testers are assigned equivalent résumés and are matched on a variety of characteristics like age, education, physical appearance, and interpersonal skills. Because black and white testers are sent to the same firms, and testers are matched on a wide variety of characteristics, much of the unexplained variation that confounds residual estimates of discrimination is experimentally controlled.  \n\nIn part due to taxing logistical requirements, the use of in-person audit studies of employment remains rare, with only a handful of such studies conducted over the past 20 years (Bendick, Jackson, and Reinoso 1994; Bendick et al. 1991; Cross et al. 1990; Pager 2003; Turner, Fix, and Struyk 1991).2 Moreover, the typical emphasis on a single comparison group leaves several significant features of contemporary urban labor markets unexplored.  \n\nBy studying both race and criminal background, the Milwaukee audit study represents an important starting point for this project (Pager 2003). The Milwaukee study examined the influence of the criminal justice system on labor market stratification by studying the effect of a criminal record for black and white job seekers. Although race emerged as a key theme in the study's findings, the topic of racial discrimination was not a central focus. Moreover, the research design yielded only indirect evidence of racial discrimination because black and white testers did not apply to the same employers. Our ability to investigate when and how racial discrimination occurs is therefore limited in this context.  \n\nThe current study updates and extends earlier research in several ways. First, we focus directly on the question of racial discrimination, in both conceptualization and design. This emphasis allows us to situate our research within ongoing debates about discrimination and to provide a rigorous design for detecting racial discrimination. Second, we move beyond standard two-race models of discrimination by including matched black, white, and Latino job seekers, reflecting the racial heterogeneity of large urban labor markets. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to simultaneously examine the employment experiences of three racial/ethnic groups. Third, to help calibrate the magnitude of racial preferences, we compare applicants affected by varying forms of stigma; specifically, we compare minority applicants with white applicants just released from prison. Where the Milwaukee study attempted this comparison across teams, the present analysis provides a direct test by comparing the outcomes of minority and ex-offender applicants who visit the same employers. Finally, we extend our analysis from the quantitative evidence of differential treatment to a rich set of qualitative data that allow for an exploration of the process of discrimination. Drawing from the testers’ extensive field notes that describe their interactions with employers, we provide a unique window into the range of employer responses that characterize discrimination in contemporary low-wage labor markets.  \n\n### RESEARCH DESIGNAND METHODS  \n\nThe New York City Hiring Discrimination Study sent matched teams of testers to apply for 340 real entry-level jobs throughout New York City over nine months in 2004. The testers were well-spoken, clean-cut young men, ages 22 to 26. Most were college-educated, between 5 feet 10 inches and 6 feet in height, and recruited in and around New York City. They were matched on the basis of their verbal skills, interactional styles (level of eye contact, demeanor, and verbosity), and physical attractiveness. Testers were assigned fictitious résumés indicating identical educational attainment and comparable qualities of high school, work experience (quantity and kind), and neighborhood of residence. Résumés were prepared in different fonts and formats and randomly varied across testers, with each résumé used by testers from each race group. Testers presented themselves as high school graduates with steady work experience in entry-level jobs. Finally, the testers passed a common training program to ensure uniform behavior in job interviews. While in the field, the testers dressed similarly and communicated with teammates by cell phone to anticipate unusual interview situations.  \n\nWe fielded two teams that each included a white, Latino, and black tester. To help ensure comparability, the Latino testers spoke in unaccented English, were U.S. citizens of Puerto Rican descent, and, like the other testers, claimed no Spanish language ability. The first team tests a standard racial hierarchy, with the white tester serving as a benchmark against which to measure variation in racial and ethnic discrimination. To calibrate the magnitude of racial stigma, the second team compares black and Latino testers with a white tester with a criminal record. The criminal record was typically disclosed in answer to the standard question on employment applications, “Have you ever been convicted of a crime? If yes, please explain.\" We instructed testers to reveal, when asked, that they had recently been released from prison after serving 18 months for a drug felony (possession with intent to distribute, cocaine). In addition, following Pager (2003), the white tester's criminal record was also signaled on the résume by listing work experience at a state prison and by listing a parole officer as a reference.3  \n\nFor both teams, we sampled employers from job listings for entry-level positions, defined as jobs requiring little previous experience and no more than a high school degree. Job titles included restaurant jobs, retail sales, warehouse workers, couriers, telemarketers, customer service positions, clerical workers, stockers, movers, delivery drivers, and a wide range of other low-wage positions. Each week, we randomly drew job listings from the classified sections of the New York Times, Daily News, New York Post, Village Voice, and the online service Craigslist. The broad range of job listings allowed for extensive coverage of the entry-level labor market in New York. From the available population of job listings, we took a simple random sample of advertisements each week. Testers in each team applied to each job within a 24-hour period, randomly varying the order of the applicants.  \n\nOur dependent variable records any positive response in which a tester was either offered a job or called back for a second interview. We recorded callbacks using voicemail boxes set up for each tester. For employer $i(i=1,\\dots,N)$ and tester : $t\\left(t=W,B,$ or $L$ for white, black, or Latino), a positive response, $y_{i t}$ is a binary variable that scores 1 for a job offer or callback, and O otherwise. We define the level of differential treatment as the ratio in positive response rates for each comparison, $r_{W B}=\\bar{y}_{W}/\\bar{y}_{B}$ , where $\\bar{\\mathcal{V}}_{t}$ is the proportion of positive responses for testers of race $t.$ Under the null hypothesis of equal treatment, $r_{W B}=$ 1, the proportion of positive responses received by each racial group is equal. For data on matched pairs, several statistical tests have been proposed that use within-pair comparisons to account for the correlation of observations from the same pair (e.g., Agresti 1990; Heckman and Siegelman 1993). In our case, where three testers are sent to the same employer, we have a matched triplet and information from all three testers should ideally contribute to an inference about a contrast between any two. Ghosh and colleagues (2000) suggest that matched pairs can be fit with a hierarchical logistic regression with a random effect for each pair. We generalize their approach to our matched triplets, fitting a random effect for each employer. If the probability of a positive response is given by $\\operatorname{E}(y_{i t})=p_{i t},$ the hierarchical model is written  \n\n$$\n\\log(\\frac{p_{i t}}{1-p_{i t}}){=}\\alpha_{i}{+}\\beta B_{i t}{+}\\gamma L_{i t},\n$$  \n\nwhere $B_{i t}$ is a dummy variable for blacks, $L_{i t}$ is a dummy variable for Latinos, and the random effects for employers, $\\upalpha_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is given a normal distribution. The employer effects, $\\mathbf{q}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ induce a correlation among observations from the same employers and reduce standard errors, as in the usual matched-pair inference. We estimate the models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We construct intervals for the ratios $(_{r W B},r_{W L}$ and $r_{B L})$ by taking random draws from the posterior predictive distribution of $y_{i t}.$ . Alternative methods that adjust for clustering by employer yield similar results to those reported below.  \n\n### THE PROBLEMS OF MATCHING  \n\nThe quality of audit results depends on the comparability of the testers. Because race cannot be experimentally assigned, researchers must rely on effective selection and matching to construct audit teams in which all relevant characteristics of testers are similar—something that may leave substantial room for bias. Heckman and Siegelman (1993) argue that researchers know little about the hard-to-observe characteristics highly prized by employers. If testers are poorly matched, evidence of discrimination may be merely an artifact of idiosyncratic tester characteristics.  \n\nBertrand and Mullainathan (2004) remove tester effects in a “correspondence test\" that sent résumés with common white and black names to employers in Boston and Chicago. Their design allows the random assignment of résume characteristics to white- and black-sounding names, largely removing concerns about unobserved characteristics. Résumés with white names were 50 percent more likely than those with black names to receive callbacks from employers (9.7 versus 6.5 percent). Studies of this kind provide some reassurance that results from the body of audit research are not driven by tester effects alone.  \n\nBecause we rely on in-person audits for our study of low-wage labor markets, the effective matching of testers is a key concern.4 We reviewed more than 300 applicants to identify our final team of 10 testers.5 Successful applicants were subject to two lengthy screening interviews and a written test, a far more probing job selection process than the testers encountered in their fieldwork.6 Each tester passed a standard training period, was required to dress uniformly, and was subject to periodic spot checks for quality control.7  \n\nDespite these measures, uncontrolled tester effects remain a threat to inferences about discrimination. We assess the sensitivity of our results to testers in four ways. First, each tester may have a unique effect, but the average effect of the testers may be zero. In this case, the observations from each tester will be correlated and standard errors that ignore this clustering will tend to be too small. We allow for this possibility by fitting an additional random effect for each tester in our hierarchical logistic regression. & Second, each tester may have a unique effect, but these effects may not average to zero. To assess the sensitivity of our results to each tester, we perform a type of cross-validation in which the treatment effect is recalculated for a reduced data set, sequentially omitting those employers associated with each individual tester. Confidence intervals below are based on models that include employer and tester random effects. We compare these results with cross-validation treatment effects based on subsets of the data in which individual testers are sequentially omitted. Third, we recalculate our key results for each unique combination of testers matched in teams over the course of the fieldwork (see Appendix Table A2). These results, although sensitive to small sample sizes for some combinations, tend to support the consistency of effects across a number of tester comparisons.  \n\nAs a final investigation of tester effects, we consider the possibility that the expectations or behaviors of testers may influence the audit results in nonrandom ways. For example, if a black tester expects to be treated poorly by employers, he may appear more withdrawn, nervous, or defensive in interactions. The nature of the interaction may create a selffulfilling prophecy, in which the tester experiences poor outcomes for reasons unrelated to his race (Steele and Aronsen 1995). We assess these tester effects by analyzing the degree to which personal contact between testers and employers is associated with widening racial disparities. Overall, we find no evidence that testers’ interpersonal styles or expectations are associated with increasing discrimination; if anything, personal contact appears to weaken the effect of race, suggesting that testers’ performance minimized, rather than exaggerated, our measures of racial bias (see Appendix, Table A1).  \n\nThe problem of imperfect matching among testers is a well-understood vulnerability of audit experiments, and one to which we devoted considerable attention. Ironically, however, achieving perfect matches can itself produce distortions in the hiring process. Because audit partners are matched on all characteristics that are most directly relevant to hiring decisions (e.g., education, work experience, and physical attributes), employers may be forced to privilege relatively minor characteristics simply out of necessity to break a tie (Heckman 1998:111). If employers care only marginally about race, but are confronted with applicants equal on all other dimensions, this single characteristic may take on greater significance than it would under normal circumstances when evaluating real applicants who differ according to multiple dimensions.  \n\nThe design of our study, which focuses on the early stages of the hiring process, avoids situations in which employers must choose only a single applicant. By using “callbacks\"” as one of our key dependent variables, we include cases that represent an employer's first pass at applicant screening.9 Indeed, recent surveys suggest that employers interview an average of six to eight applicants for each entry-level job opening (Pager 2007b). If race represents only a minor concern for employers, we would expect all members of our audit team to make it through the first cut. If race figures prominently in the first round of review, we can infer that this characteristic has been invoked as more than a mere tie-breaker. In these cases, the evidence of race-based decision making is quite strong.  \n\n### EXPERIMENTALRESULTS  \n\nThe primary results from the field experiment focus on the proportion of applications submitted by testers that elicited either a callback or a job offer from employers, by race of the applicant. Our first team assesses the effects of race discrimination by comparing the outcomes of equally qualified white, Latino, and black applicants. Figure la reports positive response rates for each racial/ethnic group. In applications to 171 employers, the white tester received a callback or job offer 31.0 percent of the time, compared with a positive response rate of 25.2 percent for Latinos and 15.2 percent for blacks. These results show a clear racial hierarchy, with whites in the lead, followed by Latinos, and blacks trailing behind.  \n\nFigure 1b shows the contrasts between the three race groups. Once we adjust for employer and tester effects, the confidence interval for the white-Latino ratio of 1.23 includes one.10 By contrast, the white-black ratio of 2.04 is substantively large and statistically significant. The positive response rate for blacks is also significantly lower than the rate for Latinos. The points in the figure show the cross-validation results obtained by sequentially dropping cases associated with each individual tester. All ratios remain consistently greater than one, indicating that employers treat blacks less positively regardless of which testers are applying for jobs. Overall, these results indicate that, relative to equally qualified blacks, employers significantly prefer white and Latino job applicants. The findings suggest that a black applicant has to search twice as long as an equally qualified white applicant before receiving a callback or job offer from an employer.  \n\nThe results from this first comparison indicate employers’ strong racial preferences, but the magnitude of this preference remains some-what abstract. To calibrate the effects of race against another stigmatized category, the ex-offender, we repeated the experiment, this time assigning a criminal record to the white tester. Figure 2a shows the percentage of positive responses—job offers or callbacks—-received by each tester. In this experiment, whites with criminal records obtained positive responses in 17.2 percent of 169 job applications, compared with 15.4 percent for Latinos and 13.0 percent for blacks.11 The white testers' racial advantage narrows substantially in this comparison; yet the white applicant with a criminal record still does just as well, if not better, than his minority counterparts with no criminal background.  \n\nFigure 2b shows that the white-Latino ratio is close to one and the confidence interval overlaps one by a large margin. The white-black ratio is now a statistically insignificant 1.32, compared with a significant ratio of 2.04 when the white tester had a clean record. As in the previous experiment, Latinos were preferred to blacks, but here the difference is not significant. As before, the cross-validation treatment effects, obtained by dropping employers associated with one particular tester, are all close to one. These results indicate that, regardless of which testers were sent into the field, employers differentiated little among the three applicant groups.  \n\nThe comparison of a white felon with black and Latino applicants with clean backgrounds provides a vivid calibration of the effects of race on hiring decisions. While ex-offenders are disadvantaged in the labor market relative to applicants with no criminal background, the stigma of a felony conviction appears to be no greater than that of minority status. Replicating earlier results from Milwaukee (Pager 2003), these findings suggest that New York employers view minority applicants as essentially equivalent to whites just out of prison.  \n\nTheories of statistical discrimination point to the very high incarceration rates among young black men as a key explanation for employers’ indifference between white felons and blacks with potentially unobserved criminal histories. Current estimates suggest that roughly 18 percent of young black men with high school degrees will experience incarceration by their early 30s (Pettit and Western 2004), and a larger fraction surely have lower level convictions and arrests. Still, the fact that known information about a white applicant's serious criminal conviction is viewed with no more concern than the assumed characteristics of a young black man points to the strength and intensity of contemporary racial attitudes. Overcoming these negative expectations, even for a candidate with otherwise appealing characteristics, requires the negotiation of a number of significant hurdles not present for white job seekers.  \n\n### RACEATWORK:ANEXAMINATIONOFINTERACTIONSBETWEENAPPLICANTSAND EMPLOYERS  \n\nThe strong evidence of hiring discrimination from the field experiment provides a clear measure of the continuing significance of race in employer decision making. These numbers, however, tell us little about the process by which race comes to matter. Fortunately, the in-person design of the experiment allows us to further supplement the experimental findings with qualitative evidence from testers’ field notes that report their interactions in job interviews. These detailed narratives describe employers’ deliberations and suggest some of the ways race comes into play during employment interactions.  \n\nOur analysis examines cases in which testers had sufficient interaction with employers for content coding. Consistent with the notion that contemporary forms of discrimination are largely subtle and covert, many cases contain little that would lead us to anticipate the differential treatment that followed. Of those that do, however, we observe several consistent patterns in employers’ responses. In particular, three categories of behavior stand out, which we refer to here as: categorical exclusion, shifting standards, and race-coded job channeling. The first type of behavior, categorical exclusion, is characterized by an immediate or automatic rejection of the black (or minority) candidate in favor of a white applicant. Occurring early in the application process, these decisions involve little negotiated interaction but appear to reflect a fairly rigid application of employers’ racial preferences or beliefs. A second category of behavior, shifting standards, reflects a more dynamic process of decision making. Here we observe cases in which employers’ evaluations of applicants appear actively shaped or constructed through a racial lens, with similar qualifications or deficits taking on varying relevance depending on an applicant's race. Finally, a third category of behavior moves beyond the hiring decision to a focus on job placement. Racebased job channeling represents a process by which minority applicants are steered toward particular job types, often those characterized by greater physical demands and reduced customer contact.  \n\nBy observing the interactions that characterize each of these behavior types, we gain a rare glimpse into the processes by which discrimination takes place. At the same time, we emphasize that this discussion is intended as a descriptive exercise rather than a formal causal analysis. Indeed, the categories we identify are not mutually exclusive; some of the same processes may be operating simultaneously, with employers’ shifting evaluations of applicant skills leading to different patterns of job channeling, or assumptions about the appropriate race of the incumbent of a particular position leading to forms of categorical exclusion. Likewise, this typology cannot account for all of the differential treatment we observe-at least half of the employer decisions were made on the basis of little or no personal contact between applicant and employer, leaving the nature of the decision entirely unobserved. With these caveats in mind, we nevertheless view the analysis as providing a unique contribution to the study of racial discrimination, revealing mechanisms at work that observational research can rarely identify.  \n\n#### CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION  \n\nFew interactions between our testers and employers revealed signs of racial animus or hostility toward minority applicants. At the same time, a close comparison of test partners' experiences shows a number of cases in which race appears to be the sole or primary criterion for an employer's decision. With little negotiation or deliberation over the selection decision, these employers’ decisions seem to reflect a preexisting judgment regarding the adequacy or desirability of a minority candidate. The uncompromising nature of the employer's decision can be characterized as a form of categorical exclusion.  \n\nA clear-cut case of categorical exclusion was provided when all three testers applied for a warehouse worker position and received a perfunctory decision. Zuri, one of our black testers, reported: “\"The original woman who had herded us in told us that when we finished filling out the application we could leave because ‘there's no interview today, guys!' ... When I made it across the street to the bus stop ... the woman who had collected our completed applications pointed in the direction of Simon, Josue, and myself [the three test partners] motioning for us to return. All three of us went over... She looked at me and told me she ‘needed to speak to these two' and that I could go back.\" Zuri returned to the bus stop, while his white and Latino test partners were both asked to come back at $5\\mathrm{p.m}$ .that day to start work. Simon, the white tester, reported, “\"She said she told the other people that we needed to sign something--that that's why she called us over—so as not to let them know she was hiring us. She seemed pretty concerned with not letting anyone else know.\"\"  \n\nIn this context, with no interview and virtually no direct contact with the employer, we observe a decision that appears to be based on little other than race. The job is a manual position for which Zuri is at least as able, yet he is readily passed over in favor of his white and Latino counterparts.  \n\nThis case is unusual in that three testers were rarely present at a given location at the same time. More often, we found evidence of differential treatment only after comparing the testers’ reports side by side. Here again, we observed several hiring decisions in which race appeared to be the sole or primary source of differentiation. In one example, the three testers inquired about a sales position at a retail clothing store. Joe, one of our black testers, reported that, “[the employer] said the position was just filled and that she would be calling people in for an interview if the person doesn't work out.\" Josue, his Latino test partner, was told something very similar: “She informed me that the position was already filled, but did not know if the hired employee would work out. She told me to leave my résumé with her.\" By contrast, Simon, their white test partner, who applied last, had a notably different experience: “I asked what the hiring process was--if they're taking applications now, interviewing, etc. She looked at my application. \\*You can start immediately?'Yes. ^Can you start tomorrow?'Yes. \\*10 a.m.'She was very friendly and introduced me to another woman (white, 28) at the cash register who will be training me.\"  \n\nA similar case arose a few weeks later at an electronics store. Joe, the black tester, was allowed to complete an application but was told that his references would have to be checked before he could be interviewed. Meanwhile, Simon and Josue, his white and Latino partners, applied shortly afterward and were interviewed on the spot. Joe's references were never called, while Simon received a callback two days later offering him the job.  \n\nWhen evaluated individually, these interactions do not indicate racial prejudice or discrimination. Side by side, however, we see that minority applicants encounter barriers not present for the white applicant, with employers citing excuses for putting off the black or minority candidate (e.g., \"the job has already been filled\"' or “\"we'd have to check your references before we can proceed\") that appear not to apply for the white applicant. To be sure, certain cases may capture random error—-perhaps a position became available between the testers’ visits, or an employer was otherwise preoccupied when one applicant arrived but not another, leading to the employer's differential response. Still, the consistency of the pattern in these data suggests that random error is unlikely to be a dominant factor. Indeed, of the 171 tests conducted by the first team (no criminal background), white testers were singled out for callbacks or job offers 15 times, whereas there was only a single case in which a black tester received a positive response when his white or Latino partner did not.12  \n\nThese cases of categorical exclusion, although directly observed in only a small number of audits (5 of the 47 cases of differential treatment across the two teams), reveal one form of discrimination in which racial considerations appear relatively fixed and unyielding. 13 Before black (or minority) candidates have the chance to demonstrate their qualifications, they are weeded out on the basis of a single categorical distinction.  \n\nCategorical exclusion represents one important form of discrimination. While these rather abrupt interactions reveal little about the underlying motivation that drives employers' decisions, they do demonstrate the sometimes rigid barriers facing minority job seekers. In these cases, black (or minority) applicants are discouraged or dismissed at the outset of the employment process, leaving little opportunity for a more nuanced review.  \n\n#### SHIFTINGSTANDARDS  \n\nMaking it past the initial point of contact was not the only hurdle facing minority applicants. Indeed, among those who recorded more extensive interaction with employers, we observe a complex set of racial dynamics at work. On the one hand, personal contact with employers was associated with significantly improved outcomes for all testers and a narrowing of the racial gap (see Appendix, Table A1). The testers’ interpersonal skills seemed to reduce the influence of racial bias, or at least did not exacerbate it. Yet, even in the context of this more personalized review, we see evidence of subtle bias in the evaluation of applicant  \n\nqualifications. In particular, a number of cases reveal how testers′ “objective” qualifications appear to be reinterpreted through the lens of race. Although testers’ résumés were matched on education and work experience, some employers seemed to weigh qualifications differently depending on the applicant's race. In the following interactions, we see evidence that the same deficiencies of skill or experience appear to be more disqualifying for the minorityjobseekers $(\\mathrm{N}=11\\$  \n\nIn one case, Joe, a black tester, was not allowed to apply for a sales position due to his lack of direct experience. He reported, “[The employer] handed me back my résumé and told me they didn't have any positions to offer me ... that I needed a couple years of experience.\" The employer voiced similar concerns with Josue and Kevin, Joe's Latino and white partners. Josue wrote, “After a few minutes of waiting ... I met with [the employer] who looked over my résumé. He said that he was a little worried that I would not be able to do the work.” Kevin reported an even stronger reaction: “[The employer] looked at my résume and said, “There is absolutely nothing here that qualifies you for this position.' Yet, despite their evident lack of qualifications, Kevin and Josue were offered the sales job and asked to come back the next morning. In interactions with all three testers, the employer clearly expressed his concern over the applicants’ lack of relevant work experience. This lack of experience was not grounds for disqualification for the white and Latino candidates, whereas the black applicant was readily dismissed.  \n\nWhen applying for a job as a line cook at a midlevel Manhattan restaurant, the three testers encountered similar concerns about their lack of relevant experience. Josue, the Latino tester, reported, μ“[The employer] then asked me if I had any prior kitchen or cooking experience. I told him that I did not really have any, but that I worked alongside cooks at [my prior job as a server]. He then asked me if I had any “knife’ experience and I told him no... He told me he would give me a try and wanted to know if I was available this coming Sundayat $2{\\tt p.m}$ \" Simon, his white test partner, was also invited to come back for a trial period. By contrast, Joe, the black tester, found that “they are only looking for experienced line cooks.”\" Joe wrote, “I started to try and convince him to give me a chance but he cut me off and said I didn't qualify.\"' None of the testers had direct experience with kitchen work, but the white and Latino applicants were viewed as viable prospects while the black applicant was rejected because he lacked experience.  \n\nIn other cases, employers perceived real skill or experience differences among applicants despite the fact that the testers’ résumés were designed to convey identical qualifications. In one example, the testers applied for a job at a moving company. Joe, the black applicant, spoke with the employer about his prior experience as a stockperson at a moving truck company, but “[the employer] told me that he couldn't use me because he is looking for someone with moving experience.\" Josue, his Latino partner, presented his experience as a stocker at a delivery company and reported a similar reaction, “He then told me that since I have no experience ... there is nothing he could do for me.\" Simon, their white test partner, presented identical qualifications, but the employer responded more favorably: \"\"To be honest, we're looking for someone with specific moving experience. But because you've worked for [a storage company], that has a little to do with moving.′ He wanted me to come in tomorrow between 10 and 11.\" The employer is consistent in his preference for workers with relevant prior experience, but he is willing to apply a more flexible, inclusive standard in evaluating the experience of the white candidate than in the case of the minority applicants. Employers’ shifting standards, offering more latitude to marginally skilled white applicants than to similarly qualified minorities, suggest that even the evaluation of \"objective” information can be affected by underlying racial considerations.  \n\nEven in cases where the white tester presented as a felon, we see some evidence that this applicant was afforded the benefit of the doubt in ways that his minority counterparts were not. In applying at an auto dealership, for example, the three testers met with very different reactions. Joe, the black tester, was informed at the outset that the only available positions were for people with direct auto sales experience. When Josue, his Latino partner, applied, the lack of direct auto sales experience was less of a problem. Josue reported, “He asked me if I had any customer service experience and I said not really.... He then told me that he wanted to get rid of a few bad apples who were not performing well. He asked me when I could start.\" Josue was told to wait for a callback on Monday. When the employer interviewed Keith, their white exfelon test partner, he gave him a stern lecture regarding his criminal background. The employer warned, “I have no problem with your conviction, it doesn't bother me. But if I find out money is missing or you're not clean or not showing up on time I have no problem ending the relationship.\" Despite the employer's concerns, Keith was offered the job on the spot. The benefit of the doubt conferred by whiteness persists here, even in the context of a white applicant just released from prison.  \n\nA pattern in these interactions, when compared side by side, is the use of double standards seeking higher qualifications from blacks than non-blacks, or viewing whites as more qualified than minorities who present equivalent résumés. Recent research emphasizes employers’ use of race as a proxy for difficult-to-observe productivity characteristics (Moss and Tilly 2001; Waldinger and Lichter 2003). Where we have detailed field notes on job interviews, the interactions we observe suggest that employers also use race in interpreting and weighing observable skill characteristics. Standards appear to shift as employers evaluate various applicants’ qualifications differently depending on their race or ethnicity (see also Biernat and Kobrynowicz 1997; Yarkin, Town, and Wallston 1982).  \n\n#### RACE-CODED JOB CHANNELING  \n\nThe first two categories of differential treatment focus on the decision to hire. Beyond this binary decision, employers also face decisions about where to place a worker within the organizational hierarchy. Here, at the point of job placement, we observe a third category of differential treatment. In our review of the testers’ experiences, we noticed that applicants were sometimes encouraged to apply for different jobs than the ones initially advertised or about which they had inquired. In many cases, these instances of channeling suggest a racecoding of job types, whereby employers prefer whites for certain positions and minorities for others. In one case, Zuri, a black tester, applied for a sales position at a lighting store that had a sign in the front window stating “Salesperson Wanted.\" Zuri described the following interaction: “\"When she asked what position I was looking for I said I was open, but that since they were looking for a salesperson I would be interested in that. She smiled, put her head in her hand and her elbow on the table and said, “I need a stock boy. Can you do stock boy?\" Zuri's white and Latino test partners, by contrast, were each able to apply for the advertised sales position.  \n\nAnother black tester, Joe, was similarly channeled out of a customer service position in his application to a Japanese restaurant. Joe reported, “I told her I was there to apply for the waiter position and she told me that there were no server positions. I told her it was advertised in the paper, and she said there must have been a mistake. She said all she had available was a busboy position. I told her since there was no waiter position, I would apply for the busboy.\" Later that day, Kevin, his white test partner, was hired for the server position on the spot.  \n\nWe also observed channeling of the Latino testers. Josue's fieldnotes of an audit at a clothing retailer begin by describing the “young white 20-something women running the place.\" One of the women interviewed him, asked about past work experience, and asked which job he was applying for. “I told her ésales associate,” Josue reported, and he presented a résume on which the most recent job listed was as a sales assistant at a sporting goods store. “\"She then told me that there was a stock position and asked if I would be interested in that.\"' Josue was offered the stocker job and asked to start the next day.  \n\nIn many cases, these instances of channeling are coded as “positive responses\" in the initial analyses. While our key concern is about access to employment of any kind, this general focus masks another form of racial bias at work. A closer analysis of the testers’ experiences suggests that decisions about job placement, like hiring more generally, often follow a racial logic. We coded all instances of job channeling across both our teams and counted 53 cases (compared with 172 positive responses). By comparing the original job title to the suggested job type, we then categorized these cases as downward channeling, upward channeling, lateral channeling, or unknown. We define downward channeling as (1) a move from a job involving contact with customers to a job without (e.g., from server to busboy), (2) a move from a white-collar position to a manual position (e.g., from sales to stocker), or (3) a move in which hierarchy is clear (e.g., from supervisor to line worker). We define upward channeling as a move in the opposite direction. We focus on these two types of channeling for our current analysis. After eliminating cases in which all testers within a team were similarly channeled, we have 23 additional cases of differential treatment that were not recorded by our initial measurement of job offers and callbacks.  \n\nLike hiring criteria, job placement is also patterned by race (see Table 1). Black applicants were channeled into lower positions in nine cases, Latinos were channeled down in five cases, and whites experienced downward channeling in only one case. Many of these cases were restaurant jobs in which the tester applied for a position as a server but was steered to a job as a busboy or dishwasher. In almost all cases, the original position required extensive customer contact while the suggested position did not (e.g., salesperson to stocker). Testers were sometimes guided into lower positions because their résumés indicated limited work experience, but racial differences in channeling suggest that insufficient work experience was more penalizing for minorities than for whites. The one case of downward channeling among white applicants involved a tester presenting with a criminal background.  \n\nIn fact, whites were more often channeled up than down. In at least six cases, white testers were encouraged to apply for jobs that were of a higher-level or required more customer contact than the initial position they inquired about. In one case, the white tester was even encouraged to apply for a supervisory position, despite limited work experience. Kevin reported: \\*“[The employer] then asked me if I had any experience in construction. I told him I did not. He asked if I would be okay working with people that have thick accents like his. I told him that was fine. He then told me that he wanted me to be his new company supervisor.\"  \n\nEmployers appear to have strong views about what kind of person is appropriate for what kind of job, based either on their own assumptions of worker competence or assumptions about what their clients expect or prefer in the appearance of those serving them. Consistent with the testers? field notes, employers appear to apply more stringent hiring criteria to minority workers, preferring whites for jobs that require greater skill or responsibility. In addition, minorities are disproportionately channeled out of customer service positions, consistent with other research in which employers view minority applicants as lacking communication skills or as otherwise discomfiting for customers. Although our testers presented highly effective styles of interpersonal communication, the cursory review process for these jobs often leaves group membership more salient than any individuating characteristics.  \n\nThe three types of differential treatment we observe illustrate how employers enact their racial preferences in the hiring process. Rather than outward hostility or racial animus, we see more subtle forms of discouragement or rejection. At multiple points in the hiring process, black (or Latino) applicants face additional hurdles or barriers that reduce their chances of employment and affect the quality of jobs for which they are considered. Figure 3 illustrates the processes identified in the preceding discussion. At each of the three decision points, we see pathways deflected by various forms of racial bias. Subtle differences in employers′ responses—-often imperceptible to the applicants themselves— produce a pattern of outcomes systematically affected by race.  \n\nComplementing the quantitative indicators of differential treatment, these qualitative observations provide a rare window into the processes by which discrimination occurs. The three categories of differential treatment observed in these data point to the range of experiences that constitute discrimination in the employment process.14 In a small number of cases, minority testers were disqualified early on in decisions that appear to reflect employers’ fairly rigid preferences. These instances of categorical exclusion represent one of the most extreme forms of discrimination, wherein minority applicants have little opportunity to overcome employers’ potential concerns. By contrast, a larger number of interactions suggest a more complicated set of negotiations at play. In evaluating applicant qualifications, minority applicants, and black men in particular, appear to be held to a higher standard than their white counterparts. Black men are disqualified more readily, or hired more reluctantly, than their white partners with identical skills and experience. Furthermore, racialized assessments of applicant quality and “fit” affect not only the decision to hire, but also decisions about job placement, with minority applicants more often channeled into positions involving less skill or customer contact. Together, these experiences illustrate how racial disadvantage is dynamically constructed and reinforced, with the assessment of applicant qualifications and suitability subject to interpretation and bias. While not an exhaustive catalogue of discrimination experiences, the fact that these dynamics are observed in natural settings (with little prompting) attests to their relative frequency and regularity. Our testers’ experiences suggest how race shapes employers’ evaluations in subtle but systematic ways, with important implications for structuring opportunity along racial lines.  \n\n## DISCUSSION  \n\nSending trained testers with equivalent résumés to apply for entry-level jobs reveals clear evidence of discrimination among low-wage employers in New York City. Blacks were only half as likely to receive a callback or job offer relative to equally qualified whites; moreover, black and Latino applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than a white applicant just released from prison. The magnitude of these racial disparities provides vivid evidence of the continuing significance of race in contemporary low-wage labor markets. There is a racial hierarchy among young men favoring whites, then Latinos, and finally blacks as the candidates oflast resort.  \n\nThe episodes of discrimination recorded in this study were seldom characterized by overt racism or hostility. In fact, our testers rarely perceived any signs of clear prejudice. It was only through side-by-side comparisons of our testers’ experiences that patterns of subtle but consistent differential treatment were revealed. Minority applicants were disqualified more readily and hired more reluctantly than their white partners with identical skills and experience. Additionally, black and Latino applicants were routinely channeled into positions requiring less customer contact and more manual work than their white counterparts. In interactions between applicants and employers, we see a small number of cases that reflect employers’ seemingly rigid racial preferences. More often, differential treatment emerged in the social interaction of the job interview. Employers appeared to see more potential in the stated qualifications of white applicants, and they more commonly viewed white applicants as a better fit for more desirable jobs.  \n\nOur findings of discrimination are particularly striking because the testers in this study represent a best-case scenario for low-wage job seekers. The testers were college-educated young men with effective styles of self-presentation. Although posing as high school graduates with more limited skills, these young men stood well above the typical applicant for these low-wage jobs. The effects of race among individuals with fewer hard and soft skill advantages may well be larger than those estimated here.  \n\nAt the same time, while we find robust evidence of racial discrimination, we should be careful not to interpret these results as showing the level of discrimination actively experienced by minority job seekers in the New York labor market. Our sampling design, based on employers, not workers, over-represents small firms relative to their share of employment. The sample includes many restaurants and independent retailers for whom hiring is less bureaucratic, and who lack the human resource departments that manage the equal employment opportunity obligations of large firms (Dobbin et al. 1993). Nevertheless, our sampled employers well represent the kinds of low-skill service work that dominate lowwage urban labor markets.  \n\nA second limitation on the generalizability of our findings results from our sampling procedures based on classified advertisements. Surveys of job seekers suggest that 25 to 30 percent of low skill jobs are filled by classified ads; the remainder are filled through some combination of network referrals, walk-in applications, and employment agencies (Holzer 1987). These search strategies may generate a different distribution of employers from that reported here. Some argue that the focus on jobs advertised through metropolitan newspapers understates the extent of discrimination. Firms that wish to discriminate, it is argued, are more likely to advertise job openings through more restrictive channels, such as networks of existing employees, employment agencies, or more selective publications (Elliott 2000; Fix and Struyk 1993; Petersen, Saporta, and Seidel 2000). Others, by contrast, argue that any random sample of employers will overstate the extent of discrimination actually experienced by job seekers. If minority applicants can identify and avoid firms that discriminate, the actual incidence of labor market discrimination will be correspondingly reduced (Becker 1957; Heckman 1998).  \n\nOf course, minority workers′ ability to avoid the effects of discrimination by self-selecting into nondiscriminatory firms requires that a sufficient number of nondiscriminatory employers exist; that there are no differences in the quality of jobs offered by employers who are more and less likely to discriminate; and that the search costs necessary to locate nondiscriminatory employers are trivial. Future research using microdata to track the search patterns and outcomes of black and white job seekers could better address these issues. From our data, we can safely conclude that job searches across a wide range of employers represented by the classified ads of five New York newspapers reveal substantial discrimination. Understanding how job seekers adapt to this reality remains a challenge for futureresearch.  \n\nOur findings for the New York City labor market add to evidence of racial discrimination in employment reported from recent field experiments in Milwaukee, Boston, and Chicago (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004; Pager 2003). The significant evidence of discrimination found in these studies contrasts sharply with recent survey research showing small racial differences in wages (Farkas and Vicknair 1996; Neal and Johnson 1996). How might these disparate findings be reconciled? First, as noted above, the presence of discrimination in the labor market may lead workers to differentially sort across employers, such that minority job seekers queue for jobs offered by employers who are less likely to discriminate. These dynamics can lead to longer search or wait times for minority job seekers, which might not be reflected in ultimate wage offers. Indeed, data from the late 1990s show that the unemployment spells of black men (3.1 months) are about twice as long as those for whites (1.6 months) (Gottschalck 2003:2). This suggests that the primary effects of discrimination on labor market outcomes may be reflected in employment differentials rather than wages.15  \n\nSecond, the experience of discrimination may add to the psychic costs of the job search process, prompting some to opt out altogether. If discrimination discourages all but the most motivated and able black job seekers, black wage earners would represent an increasingly select group. Since the 1990s, increasing numbers of young black men have dropped out of the formal labor market, contributing to an artificial convergence of black and white wages (Western and Pettit 2005). Without effectively accounting for the processes that precede labor force participation—-including the discouraging effects of discrimination—-wage estimates can account for only one incomplete picture of the larger employment process.  \n\nOur findings add to a large research program demonstrating the continuing contribution of discrimination to racial inequality in the post-civil rights era. Still, significant questions remain unanswered. The audit experiment necessarily focuses on employers hiring behaviors but does not examine the skills, preferences, and networks of job seekers. We do not know, and few research designs have been devised to test, the relative magnitude of the effects of discrimination compared with the effects of human and social capital. Such an analysis would need to study both employers as they screen job applicants and workers as they search for jobs.  \n\nThe effects of discrimination, relative to human and social capital, should also be defined broadly. As evidence of discrimination in the post-civil rights era accumulates, new research should go beyond determining whether discrimination is present to consider how the effects of discrimination unfold over the life cycle and across social space. Episodes of discrimination may not only cause unemployment at one point in time, but may have longterm effects that weaken minority workers’ attachment to the labor market and reduce labor force participation. Discrimination may produce broad cultural effects in which work itself is de-legitimated as a fair source of opportunity. The effects of discrimination may also vary across the population, concentrating perhaps among the young men whose employment rates are lowest. Tracing these larger and more varied effects of discrimination show both the advantages and limits of the experimental method used here. The experiment allows us to infer discrimination with great certainty, but the effects of discrimination are narrowly defined. The broader effects of discrimination—on the cultural dimensions of economic life and over the life course—are harder to pinpoint but may indicate more fundamental and  \n\nintractable inequalities. A research agenda that includes these wider consequences would be less skeptical that discrimination exists and more curious about its continuing effects on not just employment inequality, but on American race relations more broadly.  \n\n## Acknowledgments  \n\nThis research has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Justice, the JEHT Foundation, the Princeton Research Institute on the Region, and the Industrial Relations Section of Princeton University.

Although small numbers in certain cells lead to some instability in estimates, these breakdowns can examine the consistency of effects across the full range of the sample. To account for learning or adaptation by the testers, we estimate effects for the first and second halves of the experimental period. In each period, whites and Latinos received significantly more positive responses than did blacks, and whites received slightly more positive responses than did Latinos. To examine whether our results depend strongly on any particular area within New York, we separate the experimental effects by location. Over half the audited employers were located in Manhattan. We found the pattern of black disadvantage throughout Manhattan and in the outer boroughs. To examine whether the first tester sent to an employer was more likely to be successful, we randomized the order in which testers were sent. Experimental effects are similar regardless of which tester interviewed first. Finally, we compare the outcomes of audits in which testers had little or no interaction with the employer with those characterized by more substantial personal contact. Here we see some evidence that personal contact reduces racial disparities in employment, consistent with the notion that individualizing information can help offset the effects of negative stereotypes.  \n\nThe bottom half of Table A1 presents these same comparisons for the team in which the white applicants presented evidence of a felony conviction. Across these comparisons, we find treatment effects close to zero, supporting the finding that employers did not distinguish strongly between whites with criminal records and minority job seekers without. In short, these results indicate a large racial preference among New York employers for white job  \n\napplicants over black applicants, smaller preference for whites over Latinos and Latinos over blacks, and little difference between white felons and minorities with clean backgrounds. All results are robust to tester effects and experimental effects and appear to be roughly uniform across New York City.  \n\n### RESULTSBYTESTERTEAMS  \n\nIn the course of fielding two three-person teams of testers, we used 10 different testers: two Latinos, four blacks, and four whites. In each three-person team consisting of a white, a black, and a Latino, we combined the 10 testers into six different unique combinations. Before pooling the data across combinations of testers, Heckman and Siegelman (1993) recommend testing for the homogeneity of responses across combinations. The columns in Table A2 represent mutually exclusive outcomes; overall response rates by race can be calculated by summing all columns in which a given race group is represented. A chi-square test within each team fails to reject the null hypothesis of homogeneity across combinations. With this evidence of homogeneity, we report treatment effects pooled across testers. Table A2 reports the detailed experimental results for each unique combination of testers.  \n\nTableA1 Percentage of Positive Responses and Race Differences, by Date, Employer Address, and Race

If this information is public, workers obtain its benefits. If workers cannot compensate firms for hiring them, firms will hire too few inexperienced workers. I determine the effects of hiring workers and revealing more information about their abilities through a field experiment in an online marketplace. I hired 952 randomly-selected workers, giving them either detailed or coarse public evaluations. Both hiring workers and providing more detailed evaluations substantially improved workers' subsequent employment outcomes. Under plausible assumptions, the experiment's market-level benefits exceeded its cost, suggesting that some experimental workers had been inefficiently unemployed.  \n\nAmanda Pallais   \nDepartment of Economics   \nHarvard University   \nLittauer Center   \nCambridge, MA 02138   \nand NBER   \napallais $@$ fas.harvard.edu  \n\n# 1 Introduction  \n\nYoung workers are more likely to be unemployed than older, more experienced workers.1 A key question in designing policies to improve young workers’ labor market outcomes is whether their poor outcomes result from human capital deficiencies or barriers to labor market entry. If it is the former, then these workers may need to engage in intensive education or training programs to succeed in the labor market. If it is the latter, then programs that simply give these workers a foot in the door may have long-lasting benefits.  \n\nThis paper evaluates whether inexperienced workers would benefit, on average, from simply obtaining a job because it would give them a chance to demonstrate their abilities. Employers are uncertain about the abilities of inexperienced workers. Hiring these workers generates information about their abilities (e.g., Farber and Gibbons, 1996; Altonji and Pierret, 2001). This information is valuable because it allows firms to hire higher-ability workers in the future. But, firms might not have sufficient incentive to generate this information because, if it is partially public, workers receive part of its value as higher earnings. Hiring workers is costly. Managers must spend time explaining the jobs to workers and monitoring workers’ progress. Moreover, firms incur an opportunity cost of lost time if jobs are not completed correctly or timely. If workers cannot compensate firms for hiring them and producing the information, for example because a minimum wage or adverse selection (e.g., Weiss, 1980) prevents wages from falling or because bonding is prohibitively difficult (e.g. Dickens et al., 1989), firms will hire inefficiently few entry-level workers.  \n\nThrough a field experiment in an online marketplace, this paper assesses the impact of (1) giving jobs to relatively inexperienced workers and (2) giving the market more information about workers′ job performance on their future employment outcomes and the market as a whole. The online marketplace, oDesk, consists of workers all over the world who complete approximately 200,000 hours of work per week remotely.? Importantly, when an oDesk employer terminates a job, it is required to publicly disclose a rating of the worker on a one-to-five scale and can, if it chooses, provide a short comment.  \n\nIn this experiment, I invited low-wage data-entry specialists to apply for 10-hour dataentry jobs. When workers applied, they proposed hourly wage rates for the job. The 3,767 workers who applied proposing wages of $\\$3$ per hour or less formed the experimental sample. Workers in the sample were randomized into three groups: two treatment groups (with  \n\n476 workers in each) and a control group (containing the remaining 2,815 workers). The size of the treatment groups (together approximately 25% of the sample) was determined by financial constraints. I did not hire control group workers. I hired workers in both the \"coarse evaluation treatment\" and \"detailed evaluation treatment\" groups. I provided workers in both treatment groups with a public one-to-five rating, calculated from their actual performance statistics and normed to match the distribution of ratings in the market. The ratings were calculated without reference to what treatment group the workers were in. The difference between the two treatment groups was the amount of information about workers’ performance that was in the public comment I provided. The comments workers in the coarse evaluation treatment received were designed to be as uninformative as the comments typically left in the marketplace. However, in the detailed comment treatment, workers receiving a rating of four or higher received a detailed comment with objective information about their data entry speed, accuracy, following of directions, and timely task completion. Due to IRB restrictions, I was not allowed to provide detailed evaluations to workers with low ratings. Thus, for workers earning below four, the detailed evaluation treatment was identical to the coarse evaluation treatment. Because of the large fraction of workers earning high ratings on oDesk, only 17% of workers earned ratings below four.  \n\nUsing the marketplace's administrative data, I then observed the experimental workers' subsequent oDesk employment outcomes. Workers benefitted from obtaining an experimental job. After the experiment, workers in the coarse evaluation treatment were more likely to be employed, requested higher wages, and had higher earnings than control group workers. In the two months after the experiment, inexperienced workers’ earnings approximately tripled as a result of obtaining a job. Providing workers with more detailed evaluations also increased their earnings and the wages they requested. This is consistent with the idea that more information about worker quality makes workers more valuable to frms. As theory suggests, the benefits of detailed evaluations were not universal: detailed performance evaluations helped those who performed well and hurt those who performed poorly.  \n\nThe interpretation of these results depends on whether the treatments affected outcomes by revealing information about worker ability or through another mechanism. I consider whether five alternative mechanisms could explain the experiment's results: (1) the treatment jobs provided human capital, (2) the act of hiring workers led the market to positively update its belief about their abilities, (3) the fact that workers received detailed evaluations led the market to positively update its belief about their abilities, (4) obtaining an experimental job induced workers to apply to more oDesk jobs, but did not change employers’ beliefs about workers’ abilities, and (5) I gave workers more positive ratings than they deserved. None of these alternative explanations can explain all the experiment's results. For example, the first two explanations cannot explain the results of the detailed evaluation treatment. Moreover, it does not appear that the act of hiring workers in itself led the market to positively update its beliefs about workers abilities: obtaining a job did not improve workers? employment outcomes when the market observed only that they had been hired (and not their evaluations), but outcomes improved immediately after the evaluations became public.  \n\nThe fact that the treatments benefitted treatment group workers does not imply that they increased overall market welfare. That is, treatment group workers could have simply displaced other equivalent oDesk workers. While I do not have experimental variation that allows me to estimate the effect of the experiment on the market as a whole, I compare how employment and wages changed after the experiment across oDesk's 74 job categories, based on the intensity with which the categories were affected by the experiment. I find that, after the experiment, total employment increased in more-affected job categories relative to less-affected ones, while average wages decreased in the former relative to the latter. I use these results to estimate the experiment's effects on total market surplus. Under plausible assumptions, the benefits to market participants of the increased employment induced by the experiment outweighed the experiment's social cost (the time workers spent working and I spent managing them). While I do not directly observe outcomes outside of oDesk, this calculation does account for workers’ and firms’ opportunity costs of the increased oDesk employment. The result obtains despite the fact that the experimental jobs did not create usable output and I consider only benefits within six months of the experiment. It suggests that inefficiently low hiring of novice workers led to diminished employment and output in this market.  \n\nThis paper directly relates to three strands of the literature. First is the literature on firm provision of general skills training. Public information about workers’ abilities is similar to general human capital. While public information does not increase workers′ output conditional on their working, it increases the aggregate output of a group of workers by allowing firms to hire only the highest-ability workers. Thus, discovering a worker's ability is similar to general skills training: both produce future productivity benefits, but require upfront investments. Becker (1964) shows that, because workers receive the benefits of general skills training, it will be underprovided if frms cannot be compensated for providing it. More recent work shows that if firms have monopsony power in the labor market (Acemoglu and Pischke, 1999), obtain private information about worker quality (Acemoglu and Pischke, 1998), or can use training to screen workers (Autor, 2001), they will provide some general skills training. There is some empirical evidence that firms provide general skills training that is not fully offset by lower wages (e.g., Autor, 2001; Loewenstein and Spletzer, 1998). However, neither the theoretical nor the empirical literature shows that firms recoup the full value of their training investments resulting in their providing the optimal level of training. This paper provides evidence that information about worker ability is underprovided by firms.  \n\nIf not provided by frms, general skills training can be provided by schools; but output and information about workers’ abilities are jointly produced. Worker attributes such as reliability, enthusiasm, and maturity are difficult to verify outside of an employment context. Thus, if frms do not generate this information, there may be few alternative mechanisms for its production.  \n\nThe most closely related paper to this one is Tervio (2009), which proposes that the combination of hiring costs and publicly-observable performance could generate inefficiently high wages and low employment for CEOs and entertainers. This paper shows that a similar inefficiency may lead to inefficiently low employment in entry-level labor markets, making interventions that give workers a chance to demonstrate their abilities particularly effective. There is substantial uncertainty about the abilities of entry-level workers, particularly those with little education and few credentials. Firms often cannot conceal whether they have fired, retained, or promoted a worker, an important signal of entry-level worker performance. Workers’ expected output is low, so minimum wages may be binding, making it difficult for workers to compensate firms for hiring them.  \n\nEntry-level labor markets have institutions and policies that, in theory, reduce this inefficiency: some reduce firms’ cost of hiring inexperienced workers and some directly credential workers in return for compensation. For example, internships and hiring subsidies for young workers reduce firms’ costs of hiring inexperienced workers. Fixed-term contracts (in Europe) reduce firms’ hiring costs by allowing firms to dismiss low-ability young workers more easily. In many occupations, workers can pay to take tests demonstrating their competence at a given activity. Temporary help firms play a similar role. They screen workers for a variety of competencies (e.g., Microsoft Word skills) and, in return for endorsing the worker, receive part of the worker's compensation.3 However, it is difficult for private firms to entirely remove the inefficiency. While tests can determine workers′ skills and aptitude, they may not capture workers? dedication and enthusiasm. Moreover, while policies may reduce firms? costs of hiring workers, in most cases, workers are not legally allowed to pay frms for hiring them or agree to indentured servitude contracts.  \n\nFinally, this paper relates to the large literature evaluating whether programs that help young and disadvantaged workers enter the labor market can improve their long-term outcomes. The findings from this literature are mixed.4 This paper has two primary advantages relative to this literature. First, while other programs typically combine many different elements, this experiment is able to isolate the effect of information about workers’ abilities from on-the-job training, job placement services, or stigma from participating in a given program. Second, because the experiment was so large relative to the marketplace, this paper can address the concern that benefits for hired workers came entirely at the expense of other non-studied workers. I find that this was not the case: that the benefits to experimental workers far outweighed any cost to other oDesk workers.  \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the online marketplace, lays out the experimental design, and assesses the randomization. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework and generates testable predictions for the effects of the experimental treatments. Section 4 analyzes the worker-level effects of the experiment and discusses whether they could have been generated by alternative mechanisms. Section 5 estimates the effect of the experiment on net market surplus. Section 6 concludes and discusses the application of these results to other settings as well as public policies that could potentially reduce the inefficiency.  \n\n## 2 Experimental Context and Design  \n\n### 2.1 The Marketplace  \n\noDesk is an online marketplace in which employers hire independent contractors to perform tasks remotely. The marketplace is large: immediately following the experiment in July, 2010, oDesk workers completed approximately 200,000 hours of work per week, the equivalent of 5,0oo full-time employees. oDesk workers are located around the world. Right after the experiment, a plurality (37%) lived in the United States, while India (15%) and the Philippines (14%) were the next most common countries of residence.5 In contrast, approximately 80% of employers were located in the United States. The most common types of jobs on oDesk were web programming, website design, and data entry. In general, oDesk jobs were shorter than traditional, offline jobs. But, there was a lot of variation in the length of oDesk jobs: some jobs lasted for only a few hours, while others constituted full-time employment. The average job lasted 69 hours. Repeat interactions occurred, but were not the norm. The average worker with any employment had 5.9 jobs with 4.7 unique employers.  \n\nEmployers posted job openings in 74 job categories. These postings described the job and any necessary worker characteristics. When employers posted, they chose whether to offer hourly or fixed wage jobs. Hourly jobs, the type created in this experiment, constituted 70% of jobs on oDesk. In these jobs, oDesk tracked the number of hours worked and each worker earned an established hourly wage. oDesk guaranteed that the employer would pay for the hours worked, though the employer could stop the job at any time. In a fixed wage job, the worker and employer agreed to a price for the entire project, hours worked were not recorded, and the employer had complete discretion over how much it paid.  \n\nWorkers posted public profles, describing their skills and the types of jobs they were seeking. An example is displayed in Figure 1. (This worker was not in the sample because her proposed hourly wage was too high.) Workers could apply directly to jobs; alternatively, employers could search for workers and invite them to apply. When employers searched for workers, they could search for workers with different levels of experience, choosing to contact only workers who had worked a certain number of hours or had a certain feedback score. However, employers rarely invited workers in this sample to apply: less than 9% of applications sent by treatment group workers after the experiment were initiated by employers. Under either application method, the worker proposed a price: an hourly wage (in an hourly job) or an amount for the entire project (in a fixed wage job). After reviewing their applicant pools, employers could hire as many or few applicants as they deemed suitable.  \n\nEach worker posted her preferred hourly wage rate at the top of her profile. When applying for a job, a worker could suggest a different wage to employers, but employers saw her posted wage as well. As soon as a worker began working in an hourly job, the job title, number of hours worked, and hourly wage were automatically posted to her profile. In fixed wage jobs, the job title and agreed job price were automatically posted. When an employer ended a job, it had to rate the worker from one to five on six dimensions: availability, communication, cooperation, deadlines, quality, and skills. These scores were averaged to form the worker's overall rating for the job. The worker rated the employer on the same six dimensions (before seeing her own rating); these scores were averaged to form the employer's overall rating. Because oDesk wanted the employee to be able to present her side of the story, both composite ratings were automatically posted to the worker's profile. A worker could not remove the ratings without refunding the remuneration received. Employers’ ratings were typically very positive: before the experiment, $64\\%$ of low-wage data entry workers received a rating of exactly five, while 83% averaged at least four. Workers and employers could also choose to provide short comments about the employment experience, which were also automatically posted to the worker's profile. Comments were generally one or two positive sentences providing little objective information. Unlike the numerical ratings, workers could remove employer comments without penalty, but overall only 4% of oDesk workers did.  \n\nIn addition to the employer feedback mechanism, oDesk developed a number of ways to let workers demonstrate their abilities. Because workers' listed skills and experience could be hard to verify, oDesk developed its own skills tests: 40 minute, 40 multiple choice question tests on subjects such as written English, Microsoft Word, and C++. Workers’ scores and performance relative to other oDesk workers could then be directly posted to their profiles. Workers could also display their \"qualifications,\" certifications from other online platforms, and post a portfolio of their prior work.  \n\nWorkers could also join agencies, groups of workers typically coordinated by an established worker, in return for a fraction of their earnings. The profile of each agency-affiliated worker contained the agency's average feedback score as well as the worker's own feedback score. Stanton and Thomas (2012) show that agencies were a way for workers to signal their quality. They find that agency-affiliated workers were much more likely to obtain a first job and earned higher wages in their first jobs than non-affiliated workers. However, once the market observed feedback on the workers’ own abilities, workers no longer benefitted from being in an agency. While agencies were more common among high-wage workers (only 7% of my treatment group workers were in an agency), their presence suggests the difficulties oDesk workers had in developing reputations.  \n\n### 2.2 Sample Selection  \n\nI recruited subjects for this experiment by posting hourly data-entry jobs to the marketplace and inviting workers to apply.6 The jobs were expected to take approximately 10 hours and involved entering Census records from a PDF file into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. I invited applications from every oDesk worker who had a public profile, listed her specialty as data entry, posted an hourly wage of \\$3 or less to her profile, and had applied for at least one job in the prior three months. Because hiring so many workers at one time would be both logistically difficult and a large shock to the market, I contacted workers in two waves, two weeks apart. Workers were randomly allocated to a wave. The 3,767 workers who applied to the jobs and requested a wage of $\\$3$ or less formed the experimental sample.  \n\nAppendix Table 1 shows the sample selection. Slightly fewer than 10,000 workers fit the sample selection criteria, most of whom had never had an oDesk job. Thirty-nine percent of the workers applied to the jobs, all but 85 of whom requested a wage of \\$3 or less. Workers with prior oDesk experience were substantially more likely to apply than inexperienced workers (54% and 33% applied, respectively).  \n\n### 2.3 Experimental Protocol  \n\nFigure 2 displays the experimental design. Workers were first randomized into either the control group or one of two treatment groups: the detailed evaluation or the coarse evaluation treatment group. Randomization into any treatment group was stratified on prior oDesk experience, such that workers without oDesk experience had a higher chance of being in any treatment group (32%) than experienced workers (15%). Conditional on receiving any treatment, all workers had a 50% chance of receiving the detailed evaluation treatment. Inexperienced workers constituted approximately three quarters of each treatment group.  \n\nThe coarse evaluation treatment was designed to be equivalent to being hired (and, thus, evaluated) by a typical employer in the marketplace. The detailed evaluation treatment was identical to the coarse evaluation treatment except that it provided the market with more information about some workers′ job performance. Workers in both treatment groups were hired and given a maximum of 10 hours over one week to enter the data. They were told that if, after spending 10 hours on the task, they had not completed it, they should send the file back unfinished. I recorded objective measures of workers performance: their data entry speed, their error rate, the date they returned the data file, and three measures of whether they had followed the data entry instructions. I rated all hired workers on a one-to-five scale using a weighted average of workers’ scores on these performance measures. The distribution of scores from my job was designed to match the distribution of scores low-wage data entry workers received in the marketplace, adjusted for the fact that a worker in my sample was more likely to be inexperienced than a typical oDesk worker.7 The scores were calculated in the same way for workers in both treatment groups. Approximately 18% of workers did not return the file or log any hours. Under oDesk's protocol, these workers were not rated. Thus, the treatments should be considered as an intent to hire.  \n\nThe particular treatment group to which workers were assigned affected only the type of comment workers were eligible to receive. No workers in either treatment group received a comment if they earned a rating below three. The remaining workers in the coarse evaluation treatment received an uninformative comment. The remaining workers in the detailed evaluation treatment received a detailed comment if they scored at least a four and an uninformative comment if they scored between three and four. (The human subjects committee permitted detailed evaluations only for workers scoring at least four.)8 Workers in the detailed evaluation treatment did not know that they would receive a detailed evaluation until it was posted.  \n\nThe uninformative comment was chosen to be short and positive, like most of the comments in the marketplace. The detailed comment provided objective information on the worker's data entry speed and accuracy, whether the worker met the deadline, and whether she followed the job's instructions. Additionally, it repeated the uninformative comment, so the only difference between the two comment types was the objective information provided in the detailed evaluation.  \n\nThe uninformative comment read as follows, where only the words in brackets varied by worker.  \n\n\"It was a pleasure working with [x].\"  \n\nThe detailed comment read:  \n\n\"[x] completed the project [y days before the deadline, by the deadline, Z days after the deadline] and [followed our instructions perfectly, followed our instructions, followed most of our instructions, did not follow our instructions]. [x] was in the [top 10%, top third, middle third, bottom third, bottom 10%] of providers in speed and the [top $10\\%$ , top third, middle third, bottom third, bottom 10%] in accuracy. It was a pleasure working with [x].\"9  \n\nBecause such a high fraction of oDesk workers generally earned a rating of five, many treatment group workers who received this rating were in the bottom third of speed, accuracy, or both. If employers, particularly those new to oDesk, did not realize that so many workers received fives, these detailed comments would have appeared very negative.  \n\nwithout prior experience: only 4% of inexperienced control group workers worked during this period. Unsurprisingly, a higher fraction of experienced control group workers, 27%, obtained jobs from other employers during this period. Because inexperienced workers comprised over three quarters of the treatment group, this suggests that fewer than 9% of treatment group workers would have been hired during this period in the absence of the experiment.  \n\n### 2.4 Data Collection  \n\nI directly collected data on workers’ job performance. The remaining worker characteristic and outcome data used in this project are administrative data obtained from oDesk's server with oDesk's permission. oDesk's server automatically records information on workers’ profiles, job applications, and employment. The primary worker-level outcomes are measures of workers’ employment, earnings, and reservation wages.  \n\nI consider three measures of employment: whether a worker obtained any job after the experiment, the number of jobs obtained, and the number of hours worked (in hourly jobs). I also use the wages workers posted to their profiles as a measure of their reservation wages. All workers had to post a wage to their profiles, so this measure is free from selection concerns. I observe the wage workers posted before the experiment and the timing of all subsequent changes to this posted wage, so I can determine the wage posted at any point in time. In a fully competitive market, workers would post their reservation wages. While workers do accept wages below their posted wages, there is no reason to believe the treatment affected the relationship between workers' posted wages and their reservation wages. Finally, I calculate workers' earnings from all oDesk jobs.  \n\nThree weeks after the initial randomization, I invited 630 workers to apply to another data-entry job with a fixed wage rate of either \\$0.75, $\\$1$ ,or $\\$2$ per hour. These workers were randomly selected without reference to their prior experience or whether they had been placed into the control group or a treatment group. The invitation was sent from a new employer and workers were randomized into either the \\$0.75, $\\$1$ ,Or $\\$2$ job. I recorded which workers applied and offered a job to a randomly-selected 5% of applicants. I use data on whether workers applied to this job to calculate their opportunity cost of working in the welfare calculations.  \n\n### 2.5 Randomization Assessment  \n\nTables 1 and 2 assess the randomization and present descriptive statistics about the sample Table 1 shows that the majority (63 $\\%$ ) of workers were from the Philippines, while relatively few (under $3\\%$ ) were from the United States. On average, workers without prior experience had been on oDesk for just over 4 months, passed 2.7 oDesk skills tests, and sent about 23 applications. Workers with previous jobs had been on oDesk for about twice as long and sent over seven times as many applications. They had an average of seven previous jobs (the median worker had four).  \n\nTable 1 compares the pre-experiment characteristics of workers in a treatment group with those of workers in the control group. It compares workers separately by prior experience because the randomization stratified on this variable. The treatment and control samples look similar based on covariates. Out of the 24 comparisons examined, one is statistically different at the 5% level and one is significantly different at the 10% level. In neither case, is there a significant difference between workers in the treatment and control groups when I pool the sample of workers with and without previous experience and control for workers? prior experience.  \n\nTable 2 compares workers randomized into the detailed and coarse evaluation treatment groups. Conditional on being in a treatment group, all workers had a 50% chance of being in either treatment group. The table also separately compares the covariates of workers who received ratings of four or five in the two treatment groups since these are the only workers for whom the two treatments differed. In both cases, the randomization produced similar sa.mples.  \n\n## 3 Model  \n\nThis section provides a simple framework that formalizes the insight that firms will hire inefficiently few inexperienced workers when they do not receive the benefit from discovering talented novices. It then defines two shocks to the market that are the model equivalents of the coarse and detailed evaluation treatments and generates predictions about the effects of theseshocks.  \n\n### 3.1 Model Set-Up  \n\nThe marketplace comprises a mass 1 of frms and potential workers. Workers (indexed by $i$ ) live for two periods (period O, the “novice\" period and period 1, the “\"veteran\" period). Each period, one generation of workers with mass $\\frac{1}{2}$ exits the market and a new generation enters. Firms (indexed by j) live for one period.  \n\nWorkers vary in their ability $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ , which is normally distributed in the population.10 Each firm offers one identical task in which workers? output is $y_{i}=a_{i}$ . Before a worker's novice period, the market observes her expected ability: $\\hat{a}_{i0}=a_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i a}$ where $\\varepsilon_{i a}\\sim N\\left(0,\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\right)$ and is independent of $a_{i}$ . If the worker does not work in her novice period, the market does not update its beliefs about her ability and her expected ability before her veteran period $(\\hat{a}_{i1})$ equals $\\hat{a}_{i0}$ . If a worker is employed in her novice period, the market observes a signal of her output, $\\hat{y}_{i M}$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\hat{y}_{i M}=a_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i M}\\mathrm{~where~}\\varepsilon_{i M}\\sim N\\left(0,\\sigma_{M}^{2}\\right).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFirms use this signal and Bayesian updating to update their beliefs. For simplicity, workers have the same information about their abilities as the market.  \n\nEach firm must pay a firm-specific fixed cost, $c_{j}$ , to hire a worker. This cost includes the time to explain the job to the worker as well as any related overhead costs, such as for equipment or office space. It is continuously distributed across firms on $[0,\\infty)$ , generating a downward-sloping labor demand curve. Worker $\\imath$ 's net marginal product at firm $j$ is $a_{i}-c_{j}$  \n\nEach period, firms make wage offers to workers, who can accept at most one offer. Each agent is either in an employment relationship with wages $w_{i j}$ or takes her outside option. Wages are restricted to be non-negative. Both firms' and workers? outside options are zero. Workers and firms are risk neutral and discount the future at rate $\\beta<1$ . If agents are indifferent between an employment relationship and their outside option, they enter the employment relationship. The timing of events within each period is as follows.  \n\n1. A new generation of firms and novice workers enters the market.   \n2. Firms observe each worker's novice-period expected ability $(\\hat{a}_{i0}$ )and novice-period   \noutput signal $(\\hat{y}_{i M})$ , if it exists. They calculate each worker's expected ability.   \n3. Firms make wage offers to workers.   \n4. Workers accept or reject their wage offers.   \n5. Hired workers work, producing output $y_{i}$ and receiving their wages.   \n6. Veteran workers and all firms exit the market. Novice workers become veterans.  \n\nThis model is stylized, but the assumptions are empirically-motivated. The assumptions that firms live only one period and that wages are non-negative rule out bonding and longterm contracts. In the oDesk setting, these assumptions seem reasonable. More than 50% of oDesk firms offered only one job ever. oDesk did not allow contracts with negative wages and it would have been difficult for third-world oDesk workers to transfer money to U.S. firms outside of the marketplace. More generally, Dickens et al. (1989) suggests bonding is difficult in the labor market. Workers may be liquidity constrained and bonding may negatively affect workers’ attitudes and morale and harm firms' public images. Bonding may generate moral hazard problems where firms have incentives to report that workers performed poorly. Moreover, courts will not enforce contract provisions that call for workers to pay large penalties for poor performance and most indentured servitude contracts are unenforceable.  \n\nThere was a minimum wage of O on oDesk. However, this assumption is not necessary. Any wage rigidity that prevents wages from falling will lead to a similar inefficiency where firms hire too few novice workers. For example, Weiss (1980) presents a model where adverse selection prevents wages from falling. While some unemployed workers would be willing to work for lower wages, because outside options are correlated with unobserved ability, highability workers would select out of the job if wages fell. Thus, firms will not decrease wages.  \n\nThe assumption that firms live only one period precludes firms from having monopsony power over veteran workers as they do in models of asymmetric information (e.g., Waldman, 1984 and Greenwald, 1986). While there is evidence of asymmetric information (e.9., Gibbons and Katz, 1991 and Kahn, 2012), there is also evidence that public learning about workers’ abilities is important for inexperienced workers and early career earnings dynamics (e.g., Farber and Gibbons, 1996, Altonji and Pierret, 2001, and Schonberg, 2007). It is certainly possible that the oDesk employers that remain in the market have private information about their previous hires. To the extent that private information or mobility costs allow firms to hire previously-employed workers at wages below the workers? expected marginal products, this would increase the benefit of hiring novice workers and reduce the inefficiency. Asymmetric information would also decrease the benefits of being hired for an experimental job because the market would negatively update its beliefs about workers’ abilities from the fact that I did not rehire them.  \n\n### 3.2  Market Equilibrium and Social Planner's Solution  \n\nProposition 1 The perfect Bayesian equilibrium of this game exists and has unique actions along the equilibrium path. There is a threshold, c, such that all firms with fired costs $c_{j}\\leq\\bar{c}$  \n\nwill hire a worker, while no firm with $c_{j}>\\bar{c}$ will. All workers with expected ability $\\hat{a}_{i}\\geq\\bar{c}$ and only these workers will be employed. These workers will earn wages $w_{i j}=\\hat{a}_{i}-\\bar{c}$  \n\n# Proof. See Appendix A.  \n\nBecause there is a mass of workers with expected abilities below every firm's fixed cost, not all workers will be employed. In particular, low-ability novices expected to generate losses when working at the marginal firm will not be hired. However, they would like to work and would compensate firms for hiring them because being hired in their novice period would increase their expected veteran-period earnings. If a low-ability novice does not work, her expected ability will not change and she will not be hired in her veteran period. If she works, with some probability, she will perform well enough to earn strictly positive veteranperiod wages. However, novices cannot compensate firms for hiring them: they cannot accept negative wages, post bonds, or commit to accept low wages in the future. This generates the inefficiency. It also implies that this equilibrium would not change if workers knew their own abilities. High-ability workers would be willing to compensate firms more for hiring them than would lower-ability workers, but they would not be able to do so.  \n\nIn specifying the social planner's solution, it is helpful to define $\\hat{a}_{i1H}$ ：worker $i^{\\prime}s$ veteranperiod expected ability if she is hired in her novice period.  \n\nProposition 2 The solution of a utilitarian social planner who has the same information as the market and maximizes expected market surplus (the sum of expected worker and firm surplus) is as follows. There ecists a threshold, $c^{*}>\\bar{c}$ , such that every firm with $c_{j}\\leq c^{*}$ and only these firms hire workers. All veteran workers with expected ability $\\hat{a}_{i1}\\geq c^{*}$ are employed as are all novice workers with $\\begin{array}{r}{(\\hat{a}_{i0}-c^{*})+\\beta\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\hat{a}_{i1H}\\geq c^{*})\\times E[\\hat{a}_{i1H}-c^{*}|\\hat{a}_{i1H}\\geq c^{*}]\\geq0}\\end{array}$ $A$ larger mass of novice workers is employed in the social planner's solution than in the market equilibrium and $c^{*}>\\bar{c}$  \n\n# Proof. See Appendix A.  \n\nThe social planner's solution is the equilibrium that would be enacted if novices could accept negative wages. This solution employs some novices who would be unemployed in the market equilibrium because they generate an expected loss in novice-period work. However, the expected veteran-period benefit these workers receive from novice-period work exceeds this expected loss. In general, hiring novices provides benefits in the subsequent period because it produces information about their abilities that allows them to be more efficiently allocated to either market work or unemployment. While firms have to pay the hiring cost to produce the information, workers obtain its benefits (they earn their expected marginal products which are higher because workers have been more effciently allocated to sectors).  \n\n### 3.3 Model Predictions  \n\nMotivated by my experiment, I consider the comparative statics of two shocks to the market equilibrium. The first models the coarse evaluation treatment. In this shock, an outside employer (Employer C) enters the market for one period. This employer has the same information as the market at the beginning of the period, but hires novices without regard to their expected abilities. At the end of the period, it relays an output signal for each hired worker to the market. This output signal has the same distribution as the output signal generated in market jobs. (It represents the one-to-five rating left by employers.) The second shock models the detailed evaluation treatment. As in the prior shock, an outside employer (Employer D) enters the market for one period with the same information as the market, hires novice workers without regard to their expected abilities, and relays an output signal for each hired worker to the market. However, Employer D relays a more precise output signal than Employer $C$ . It relays $\\hat{y}_{i D}$ where $\\hat{y}_{i D}=a_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i D}$ ， $\\varepsilon_{i D}\\sim N\\left(0,\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\right)$ and is independent of all other variables and $\\sigma_{D}^{2}<\\sigma_{M}^{2}$ .(Here, $\\hat{y}_{i D}$ represents the one-to-five rating plus the detailed comment.) In both shocks, if a worker is not hired by the outside employer, she remains in the market and is either hired by another firm or takes her outside option.  \n\nAn important assumption is that neither the fact that a worker was hired by an outside employer or the precision of the output signal conveys information about the worker's ability. The market updates its beliefs based only on the output signal itself. This assumption seems plausible. In the experiment, the market should not have updated its beliefs based on either of these factors since they were randomly determined (conditional on observables). Moreover, since all oDesk employers see the same worker profile and there is no face-to-face interaction, there is less scope for an employer to have private information before hiring on oDesk. The detailed evaluations were formulaic, often negative, and commonplace, characteristic of a particular employer, not the sign of a particularly talented worker. Nevertheless, I revisit this assumption when testing for alternative explanations in Section 4.2.  \n\nProposition 3 Relative to being in the market equilibrium, being hired by Employer $C$ during the novice period weakly increases a worker's expected veteran-period probability of employment, earnings, and reservation wages. It strictly increases these outcomes for workers with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ .Relative to being hired by Employer $C$ , being hired by Employer $D$ during the novice period strictly increases a worker's erpected veteran-period earnings and reservation wages, regardless of her novice-period ecpected ability, $\\hat{a}_{i0}$ . It increases her probability of veteran-period employment when $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ and decreases her probability of veteran-period employment when $\\hat{a}_{i0}>\\bar{c}$  \n\n# Proof. See Appendix A.  \n\nThe key intuition is that being hired by Employer C affects the expected veteran-period outcomes only of workers who would not have been hired in the market equilibrium (workers With $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ ). If they remain in the market equilibrium and are not hired in their novice periods, their expected abilities will not change and they will not be hired in their veteran periods. Their earnings and reservation wages will equal zero. But, if they are hired by Employer $C$ , there is some probability that they will receive a suffciently positive output signal to be employed with positive earnings and reservation wages in their veteran periods.  \n\nOn the other hand, being hired by Employer D (relative to being hired by Employer C) affects workers of all expected abilities. The more precise performance signal causes the market to update its beliefs to a greater extent based on the output signal. This leads to lower probabilities of employment for workers who would have been employed without the output signal (those with $\\hat{a}_{i0}>\\bar{c}$ )and to higher probabilities of employment for workers who would have been unemployed without the signal (those with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ ). However, more updating increases expected earnings and reservation wages for workers of all expected abilities. Consider a worker with expected ability $\\hat{a}_{i0}>\\bar{c}$ . If the market did not update its beliefs about her ability, she would be employed with certainty in her veteran period. Her earnings would equal her expected marginal product at the marginal firm, $\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\bar{c}$ . This is the average of positive marginal products for states of the world when her true ability is above the hiring threshold and negative marginal products for states of the world when her true ability is below the threshold. If, instead, the market learned her true ability in her novice period, she would be unemployed in states of the world where her actual marginal product was negative. However, her expected earnings would no longer be driven down by the fact that she could generate a negative marginal product. She would still be rewarded for her positive marginal product in states of the world where her ability was above the hiring threshold, but states of the world where she was unemployed would contribute a zero marginal product. Thus, her expected earnings would be higher when the market knew her true ability even though her expected employment rate was lower.  \n\nIn this model, a more precise output signal allows workers to be more effectively sorted into either market work or unemployment. This is the mechanism through which the signal's precision affects expected earnings. Without unemployment, the signal's precision would only affect the variance of earnings, not mean earnings.  \n\nSections 4, 5, and 6 of Appendix A present and prove three additional propositions. The first, Proposition 5, says that the effect of being hired by Employer C, relative to remaining in the market equilibrium, is increasing in the initial uncertainty over the workers? ability $(\\sigma_{a i}^{2})$ . This is intuitive. When it is more uncertain about a worker's ability, the market puts more weight on the output signal, so being hired by Employer C has a larger effect on the worker's expected veteran-period outcomes. However, counterintuitively, the proposition also says that the effect of being hired by Employer D relative to being hired Employer C is not necessarily increasing in $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ . Employer D's output signal does cause the market to update its beliefs about workers with uncertain abilities more, but so does Employer C's output signal. Thus, relative to being hired by Employer C, being hired by Employer D does not necessarily have larger effects for workers with more uncertain abilities.  \n\nProposition 6 says that while, ex ante, being hired by Employer D (relative to Employer C) increases all workers' expected earnings, ex post, being hired by Employer D can decrease workers? actual earnings. Workers who receive sufficiently poor output signals from Employer D have lower earnings and reservation wages than they would have if they had been hired by Employer C. Similarly, workers who receive sufficiently positive output signals from Employer D have higher earnings and reservation wages.  \n\nThe stylized model presented above does not include the worker's choice to exit the market because including this choice adds little insight. However, because I observe workers exiting the market, I extend the model in Section 6 of Appendix A to give workers non-zero outside options and a choice to exit the market before each period. Proposition 7 says that being hired by Employer C in the novice period (relative to remaining in the market equilibrium) weakly increases workers? probabilities of remaining in the market in their veteran periods. This is because being hired by Employer C weakly improves all workers? subsequent market employment outcomes. On the other hand, being hired by Employer D (relative to being hired by Employer C) can increase or decrease the probability that a worker remains in the market. The market updates its beliefs more after a worker is hired by Employer D. This leads to lower probabilities of remaining in the market for workers who would have done so without the performance signal and higher probabilities of remaining in the market for those who would not have.  \n\nThe final proposition considers the effect of Employer C on market employment, wages, and surplus.  \n\nProposition 4 If Employer C hires a non-zero fraction of novice workers in the subsequent period, the hiring threshold, c, will increase to $c^{\\prime}$ , total market employment will increase, wages will decrease conditional on expected ability from $\\hat{a}_{i}-\\bar{c}$ to $\\hat{a}_{i}-c^{\\prime}$ , and market surplus will increase.  \n\n# Proof. See Appendix A.  \n\nEmployer C's hiring increases the mass of veterans with expected ability $\\hat{a}_{i1}\\geq\\bar{c}$ in the subsequent period. This produces an excess supply of labor, which increases employment and decreases wages, conditional on expected ability. Market surplus increases both because employment increases (more employment relationships generate surplus) and because workers hired by Employer C replace lower expected ability workers (the same mass of jobs produces more surplus).  \n\nBecause being hired by Employer D decreases the expected veteran-period employment probabilities of workers with $\\hat{a}_{i0}>\\bar{c}$ , Employer D's hiring a non-zero fraction of novices could decrease the mass of veterans with $\\hat{a}_{i1}\\geq\\bar{c}$ . This would decrease employment and increase wages, conditional on expected ability. This seems unlikely to happen in the empirical context as far less than 50% of control group workers were hired during the treatment period, suggesting that most workers had $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ . Thus, I expect that the detailed and coarse evaluation treatments should have the same qualitative effect on market wages, employment, and surplus. However, even if Employer D decreased market employment, it would still increase market surplus by allowing employers to hire higher-ability workers.  \n\n## 4 Worker-Level Effects  \n\n### 4.1 Treatment Effects  \n\nI first assess the effects of the coarse evaluation treatment on workers? subsequent employment outcomes. Proposition 3 predicts that obtaining a job with a coarse evaluation will increase workers? employment rates, earnings, and reservation wages relative to being in the control group. Proposition 5 predicts that, conditional on workers’ expected ability, the coarse evaluation treatment will have larger effects on workers about whom the market is more uncertain.  \n\nTable 3 compares the employment outcomes of the three experimental groups in the two months following the experiment. Workers are categorized by the treatment they were assigned to at the beginning of the experiment, even though 18% of workers in the treatment groups did not accept treatment jobs and workers earning low ratings in the detailed evaluation treatment did not receive detailed comments. Posted wages are measured at the end of the two-month period and the experimental jobs themselves are excluded from any outcomes. The results are presented separately for workers with and without prior oDesk experience as the randomization stratified on this variable. I use prior oDesk experience as a proxy for certainty about a worker's ability, assuming that the market is more uncertain about inexperienced workers′ abilities. This is not a perfect proxy because experienced workers may have higher expected abilities than inexperienced workers.  \n\nThe coarse evaluation treatment's effects reflect the model's predictions: it had positive effects on employment outcomes for workers without prior oDesk experience, but no effect for experienced workers. Inexperienced control group workers performed poorly in the labor market: only 12% obtained any job in the next two months for an average earnings (unconditional on working) of approximately $\\$10$ . The coarse evaluation treatment significantly improved all five employment outcome measures for inexperienced workers. It almost tripled the fraction of these workers with any employment from 12% to 30% and the average worker's earnings from $\\$10$ to $\\$27$ . It also increased the wage these workers posted on their profiles by approximately $10\\%$  \n\nExperienced control group workers performed much better than inexperienced control group workers: over half (55%) worked on oDesk in the two months after the experiment for an average earnings of $\\$121$ . However, the coarse evaluation treatment did not significantly improve any of the five employment outcomes for experienced workers.  \n\nTable 3 also allows me to assess the effects of the detailed evaluation treatment. Proposition 3 predicts that workers in the detailed evaluation treatment will have higher earnings and reservation wages than those in the coarse evaluation treatment, while the treatment's effect on employment is ambiguous. The table shows that, relative to the coarse evaluation treatment, the detailed evaluation treatment increased experienced workers’ average earnings from $\\$101$ to \\$187 and their average posted wages by approximately $15\\%$ .The earnings gains did not come at the expense of employment; the detailed evaluation increased the fraction of workers with any subsequent employment from 53% to 69%.  \n\nHowever, the detailed evaluation treatment did not improve average employment outcomes of inexperienced workers relative to the coarse evaluation treatment. While workers in the detailed evaluation treatment had better outcomes on four out of the five employment measures than workers in the coarse evaluation treatment, the differences are neither large nor significant. There are three potential explanations for the somewhat surprising result that the detailed evaluation treatment had larger effects for experienced than inexperienced workers. First, Proposition 5 says that, conditional on expected ability, the effect of the detailed evaluation relative to the coarse evaluation is not necessarily increasing in uncertainty about worker ability. Second, the detailed evaluation should have the most impact for workers with expected abilities near the hiring threshold because there is the most uncertainty about whether these workers should be hired. Experienced workers may have expected abilities that are closer to the hiring threshold. Finally, a higher fraction of experienced than inexperienced workers in the detailed evaluation treatment actually received a detailed evaluation (74% vs. $66\\%$ 一  \n\nI next consider the robustness of the treatments’ effects on the pooled sample of experienced and inexperienced workers. Panel A of Table 4 displays the results of regressing each employment outcome on an indicator for being in the detailed evaluation treatment, an indicator for being in the coarse evaluation treatment, and indicator for having prior oDesk experience. I control for a number of covariates.11  \n\nThe table shows that both treatments improved employment outcomes for the pooled sample. Relative to the control group, the detailed evaluation treatment increased the fraction of workers employed in the next two months by 17 percentage points, while the coarse evaluation treatment increased this fraction by 13 percentage points. Both treatments increased the wage workers posted on their profiles (by $\\$0.26$ for the detailed treatment and $\\$0.15$ for the coarse treatment relative to the control group mean of \\$2.19). The detailed treatment increased workers’ earnings by $\\$29$ on average. The regression indicates that the coarse treatment increased earnings by approximately $\\$10$ , 17% of the control group mean, but this coeffcient is far from significant. While the treatment effects are large relative to the control group's average employment outcomes, they are smaller than the coefficient on the indicator for prior oDesk experience. This is expected as this latter coefficient includes both the treatment effects of multiple previous jobs and differential selection into employment.  \n\nPanel B shows the effect of receiving any experimental job, whether or not it came with the possibility of a detailed evaluation. It displays the results of regressing each employment outcome on an indicator for receiving any treatment job, an indicator for prior oDesk experience, and the same controls as in the previous panel. It shows that obtaining a treatment job increased workers? average earnings by approximately $\\$20$ ,which exceeds the average amount I spent to hire a worker (\\$16.64).  \n\nPanel A of Table 5 further probes the impact of the detailed evaluations by estimating their effects on workers who received a score of four or five in my jobs (those who were eligible to receive detailed evaluations). It displays the results of regressing each employment outcome on an indicator for being in the detailed evaluation treatment group. I do not control for prior oDesk experience since, conditional on receiving any treatment, all workers had a $50\\%$ chance of being assigned to each treatment. The treatment a worker was assigned to did not affect her rating; the treatments were identical until the evaluation was made public. The table shows that receiving a detailed evaluation increased earnings and posted wages relative to receiving a coarse evaluation. Detailed evaluations increased average earnings by $\\$24$ within two months, $44\\%$ of the mean for workers receiving fours and fives in the coarse evaluation treatment. They increased workers’ average posted wages by \\$0.24, 10% of the mean for high-scoring coarse evaluation workers. Both effects are significant at the 10% level. After one month, these effects are significant at the 5% level. Appendix Table 2 shows that the estimates do not change when the controls used in the previous table are added.12  \n\nThe effects of the treatments persisted and even increased over time. I calculate each worker's cumulative employment and earnings outcomes for each week from one to 26 weeks after the treatment jobs ended. I also record each worker's posted wages at the end of each week. Then, I regress these employment outcomes on an indicator for receiving any treatment job, controlling for prior oDesk experience. Panels A and B of Figure 3 plot the coefficients on the treatment indicator by week. The effect of obtaining a treatment job on earnings more than tripled from $\\$19.72$ after two months to $\\$65.56$ after six months. The effect of the treatment job on hours worked (which is not plotted) almost tripled, increasing from 9.7 after two months to 25.3 after six months (the p-value is only 0.11 after six months). It is striking that the treatment effects are so large given that the treatment was not restricted to those who would most benefit from it: some treatment group workers already had so much prior experience and such high expected abilities that they were unlikely to benefit, while others had such low expected abilities that even successfully completing one job would not increase their expected abilities above the hiring threshold.  \n\nThe effects of receiving a detailed evaluation also appears to persist over time, but they are much noisier. For example, when I regress cumulative earnings on an indicator for receiving a detailed evaluation in the sample of workers earning fours and fives in my jobs, the effect is positive and significant at the $5\\%$ level through week seven and significant at the $10\\%$ level through week nine. After six months, the measured effect on earnings is $\\$60.17$ 2.5 times the effect after two months, but it has a t-statistic of only 1.1.  \n\nFinally, I test Proposition 6, which says that detailed evaluations do not always help workers. It says that detailed evaluations that are more negative than both a worker's initial expected ability and the coarse evaluation she would have received impair subsequent employment outcomes relative to coarse evaluations. Detailed evaluations that are more positive than both her initial expected ability and the coarse evaluation she would have received improve outcomes. Because I know all treatment group workers′ performance, I can determine the effect of a particular detailed evaluation by comparing the outcomes of workers who received that evaluation with the outcomes of workers who would have received that evaluation had they been in the detailed evaluation treatment.  \n\nI consider the effect of revealing whether a worker met the deadline on workers earning fours and fives in my jobs. Since the vast majority of workers earning fours and fives met the deadline, not meeting the deadline was a very negative signal. It is likely more negative than the coarse rating of four or five and most workers' initial expected abilities. Thus, revealing it should have impaired workers′ subsequent employment outcomes. Meeting the deadline was a positive signal, but may not have been more positive than a rating of five or many workers? initial expected abilities. Panel B of Table 5 shows the results of regressing each employment outcome on an indicator for meeting the deadline interacted with an indicator for being in the detailed evaluation treatment, an indicator for missing the deadline interacted with the detailed treatment indicator, and the indicator for meeting the deadline itself.  \n\nRevealing that a worker missed the deadline decreased her earnings in the subsequent twomonths by $\\$35$ on average. Revealing that she met the deadline increased her earnings by $\\$24$ . These effects are large relative to mean earnings ( $\\S$ 54 for workers with ratings of four or five in the coarse evaluation treatment). The estimates indicate that revealing whether the worker met the deadline had large effects on the other employment outcomes as well, but these are imprecisely measured.  \n\nWhether the worker met the deadline is the only piece of information that appeared to matter to employers. Appendix Table 3 shows that revealing that workers did not follow all the instructions, were in the bottom third of workers in speed, or were in the bottom third of workers in accuracy did not impair their employment outcomes. This could be because these are less negative signals than missing the deadline. Alternatively, it could be because whether the worker met the deadline was the first piece of information revealed in the comment. Because of the comment's length, the parts about speed and accuracy were not immediately visible on most workers’ profiles; one had to click on the continuation to see them. This was unintentional.  \n\n### 4.2 Mechanisms  \n\nThe previous section showed that the treatments’ effects were consistent with the model's predictions. Here, I assess whether the experimental results could also be explained by alternative mechanisms. If the model's mechanism is correct, then workers with higher ratings should have better subsequent employment outcomes, all else equal. This is true in the data: after two months, workers who received ratings of five had earned \\$34 more than the control group, while workers who received ratings of one and two had earned $\\$23$ less. However, since that these ratings were not randomly assigned, it could simply be that highly-rated workers would have earned more even without the experiment.  \n\nThe first alternative is that completing a treatment job provided workers with human capital. Many existing programs that employ disadvantaged workers explicitly provide onthe-job training and, even in those that do not, workers could easily gain human capital by working for several months. It is much less likely that workers accumulated human capital in these jobs. Workers worked a maximum of 10 hours; the average hire worked for only 7.6 hours. Given workers’ offline experience, this was a very small increment to their total work experience. I did not provide training or guidance as it was impractical given the number of workers hired at one time. Moreover, workers in both treatment groups completed the same task, so human capital accumulation cannot explain the effects of the detailed evaluations.  \n\nThe second alternative is that the act of hiring a worker caused the market to positively update its belief about the worker's ability. Hiring a worker would cause the market to positively update its belief if different employers received different signals of worker quality. This is less likely on oDesk than in a traditional labor market because, on oDesk, all employers saw exactly the same resume and there were no face-to-face interactions. However, employers could interview workers and they might have valued the same information differently.  \n\nAn empirical test of this explanation utilizes the fact that the market observed that treatment group workers were hired as soon as they began working, but could not see their ratings until nine to 11 days later. In the week the workers were completing my job (during which the market only observed that they had been hired, not their evaluations), treatment group workers were no more likely to obtain jobs from other employers than control group workers. In contrast, in the week immediately after the rating became public, treatment group workers obtained significantly more jobs and were more likely to be employed than control group workers. This is not simply because treatment group workers were too busy to apply to jobs while they were completing my task: they actually applied to more jobs than control group workers during this period. Moreover, it does not appear that oDesk employers typically penalized job applicants for being currently employed on other jobs. Among oDesk workers with at least twenty previous jobs (whose reputation should not have substantially changed with another evaluation), a given worker's job application was slightly more likely to be successful if she applied while working on another job.  \n\nThis alternative cannot explain the effects of the detailed evaluations since the market observed that workers in both treatment groups were hired. However, a similar alternative is that the market positively updated its beliefs about a worker's ability based on the fact that she received a detailed evaluation. I think this is unlikely. The detailed comments were often negative. Twenty-seven percent of workers were revealed to be in the bottom third or bottom 10% of speed, while 28% were revealed to be in the bottom third or bottom 10% of accuracy. (These are less than 33% because workers earning ratings below four were not given detailed comments.) Less than 19% of workers were described as being in the top third or top 10% of both speed and accuracy. Perhaps more importantly, these comments were formulaic, contained no subjective information, and were common in the marketplace. In the two months after the experiment, only $12\\%$ of the applications workers with detailed evaluations sent went to firms that did not have another applicant who had received a detailed evaluation (with the exact same formula). Thus, these comments likely appeared to be the hallmark of a particular employer, not a particularly good worker.  \n\nA fourth alternative is that receiving a treatment job induced workers to apply to more oDesk jobs for reasons unrelated to the evaluations. For example, treatment group workers may have realized oDesk jobs were more desirable than they had thought or their initial hiring may have led them to believe it was easy to obtain oDesk employment. However, Proposition 7 also predicts that the coarse evaluation treatment should have induced workers to remain in the market by improving their oDesk employment opportunities. It is difficult to distinguish these two explanations because they have the same prediction. This prediction is borne out in the data: treatment group workers did apply to more jobs than control group workers after the experiment. However, the alternative explanation cannot explain the entire effect of the treatments because the treatments significantly increased the probability that a worker obtained a given job she applied to. Appendix B describes these results in much more detail. The explanation similarly cannot explain why receiving a treatment job increased workers’ posted wages or the effects of the detailed evaluation, which did not alter workers? application patterns.  \n\nA final alternative is that I gave workers more positive ratings and comments than they deserved, despite the facts that my ratings matched the distribution of one-to-five ratings in the market (controlling for the relative inexperience of my workers) and that the detailed comment contained some objective information. If this explanation were correct, the treatments should have had a diminished effect over time as the market learned more about the workers’ true capabilities. The data do not show this pattern: the effects of both treatments on weekly earnings appears to remain constant over time.  \n\n## 5 Welfare Analysis  \n\nIn this section, I estimate a lower bound on the experiment's effect on oDesk market surplus in the six months after the experiment. Proposition 4's proof suggests that the experiment increased welfare through two channels: (1) by increasing employment and (2) by allowing firms that would have hired workers in the absence of the experiment to hire workers with higher expected abilities. In this section, I estimate the effect of the extra employment on market surplus. I compare this increase in surplus to the costs of the experiment: the direct costs of the experimental jobs and workers’ and firms’ opportunity costs of the extra employment. I consider this a lower bound on oDesk market surplus because I cannot estimate the benefit firms received from hiring workers with higher expected abilities. However, this calculation only includes surplus obtained by oDesk workers and firms, not other agents that were affected by the experiment. For example, when workers increased their oDesk employment, they may have forgone offline jobs. This calculation includes their opportunity costs of not taking the offline jobs, but it does not account for either the lost profit of the firms that would have hired them or the increased earnings of the workers who took the offline jobs in their absence.  \n\nI frst estimate the effect of the experiment on market employment. While I do not have experimental variation I can use to estimate this, I can compare the change in employment after the experiment in those oDesk sectors more and less affected by the experiment. For each of oDesk's 74 job categories, I calculate a measure of the experiment's effect on the number of experienced workers in the category: $\"\\%$ change experience.\" First, I estimate the number of workers I hired in each category: 952 (the total number of workers I hired) multiplied by the share of treatment group applications sent to jobs in that category in the month before the experiment. Then, I divide this by the number of experienced workers working in that category before the experiment. This fraction averaged 8.5% for the entire marketplace, ranging from 55% in data entry and 79% in email response handling to less than 1% in 25 job categories, primarily ones that required specific computer skills such as web programming or game development.13  \n\nPanels A and B of Table 6 show the results of regressing two measures of log employment (log jobs created and log hours worked) in a job category-week on the interaction of \"% change experience\" and an indicator for a week after the experiment.14 I control for week fixed effects, job category fixed effects, and job category-specific linear time trends. Each regression includes 26 weeks of data before the experiment, omitting the weeks of the experiment and all jobs I ofered. The first three columns use data roughly two, four, and six months (8, 17, and 26 weeks) after the experiment. The fourth column adds job category-specific quadratic time trends and the fifth drops data entry, which accounts for approximately half of the experimental workers? employment. Observations are weighted by job category size in a preperiod and standard errors are clustered by job category. The key assumption is that, conditional on job category-specific linear and quadratic trends, employment would have changed similarly after the experiment in job categories more and less affected by the experiment.15  \n\nIn all three time windows, the effect of the experiment on new jobs was positive and significant. The elasticity ranged from 0.22 after two months to 0.27 after six months. The effect on hours worked was also positive across all three time periods, with an elasticity ranging from 0.10 to 0.14. Including job category-specific quadratic time trends has virtually no effect on the employment estimates and the results persist even when data entry is excluded.  \n\nThe total increase in worker earnings due to this increased employment is the level change in hours worked multiplied by the average hourly wage in these new jobs. This excludes any increase in fixed wage employment. To calculate this change in hours worked per week, I multiply the most conservative hours coefficient in Table 6 (0.099) by the average hours worked per week and the average value of $\\%$ change experience. This increase of 950 hours worked per week is smaller than the increase in the number of hours worked by the treatment group (1010), but not much smaller, suggesting that treatment group workers crowded out relatively little other employment.16  \n\nTo determine the average wage in these new jobs, I compare the wage distributions of treatment and control group workers after the experiment, adjusting for the stratification.17 Some of the new jobs obtained by treatment group workers represented aggregate employment increases while the rest replaced jobs that would have been held by lower expectedability workers. I define the replacement jobs as the fraction $\\frac{(1010-950)}{1010}$ of these new jobs with the lowest wages. This provides the average wages in the new jobs as $\\$2.11$ ,slightly lower than treatment group workers’ average wage after the experiment (\\$2.20). Using these estimates, the total increase in worker earnings from the employment expansion was  \n\n$$\n\\underbrace{(26\\mathrm{weeks}\\times950\\mathrm{\\frac{hours}{w e e k}})}_{\\mathrm{IncreaseinEmployment}}\\times\\underbrace{\\S2.11}_{\\mathrm{WageLevel}}\\approx\\S52,000.\n$$  \n\nFirms also benefitted from the increased employment. In particular, the theory predicts that firms with fixed costs between $c$ and $c^{\\prime}$ hired oDesk workers after the experiment. Their average profit was $E[\\hat{a}_{i}-w_{i j}-c_{j}|\\bar{c}<c_{j}\\leq c^{\\prime}]=E[\\hat{a}_{i}-(\\hat{a}_{i}-c^{\\prime})-c_{j}|\\bar{c}<c_{j}\\leq c^{\\prime}]=E[\\bar{c}^{\\prime}-c_{j}|\\bar{c}<c^{\\prime}]$ $c_{j}\\leq c^{\\prime}]$ . If $c_{j}$ is uniformly distributed between $c$ and $c^{\\prime}$ , this is $\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}(c^{\\prime}-{\\bar{c}})$ . I can approximate $c^{\\prime}-{\\bar{c}}$ using the decrease in market-level wages induced by the experiment. This is only an approximation, however, because the change in market wages captures both the change in the marginal firm's hiring cost and the change in hired workers’ expected abilities. If hired workers’ expected abilities increased after the experiment, the market-level wage change is a lower bound on the change in the fixed cost of the marginal firm.  \n\nPanel C of Table 6 estimates the experiment's effect on market-level wages. It regresses the hourly wage for a given job in a given week on interaction of the job category's $\\%$ change experience with the indicator for a week after the experiment. It controls for week fixed effects, job category fixed effects, and job category-specific linear time trends. Assuming that, conditional on the category-specific trends, wages would have changed similarly in affected and unaffected categories, the results show that the experiment substantially decreased wages. This is true in all three time periods, with elasticities ranging from 0.27 to 0.44. While adding category-specific quadratic time trends does not substantially affect the estimates, the experiment's effect on wages was driven primarily by its effect on the dataentry market. I determine the experiment's effect on the wage level (\\$0.22) analogously to the level change in hours using the same column's estimate of the wage change (-0.265). If $c_{j}$ is uniformly distributed, the increase in firm profit from the additional employment was:  \n\n$$\n\\underbrace{(26\\mathrm{{weeks}\\times950\\mathrm{{\\frac{hours}{w e e k}}}})}_{\\mathrm{IncreaseinEmployment}}\\times\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\S0.22}_{\\mathrm{AverageProfit/Job}}\\approx\\S2,800.\n$$  \n\nTable 7 estimates the overall effect of the experiment on market surplus in the six months after the experiment by combining the above estimates of the experiment's benefits with estimates of the experiment's costs. The middle column presents the most realistic estimates, while the right- and left-hand columns make more and less conservative assumptions, respectively. Panel A presents the measured benefits of the experiment. Panel B estimates workers’ and firms’ opportunity costs of the additional employment after the experiment, while Panel C estimates the cost of the experimental jobs themselves.  \n\nI assess workers’ opportunity costs of working by using their willingness to apply to the jobs I posted three weeks after the experiment. I assume that workers applied to these jobs if and only if their opportunity costs were below the jobs’ wages. If there was a time cost of applying, this overstates workers’ opportunity costs, particularly for workers with low probabilities of getting the jobs. (Experienced workers were more likely to apply to these jobs than were workers with fewer other options, suggesting that the probability of obtaining a job might be an important determinant of application behavior.） This may also slightly overestimate the average opportunity cost of the work induced by the experiment because workers with lower posted wages saw (insignificantly) larger employment gains as a result of the treatments. Because 49% of the treatment group applied to the $\\$1$ wage job, I use this as the “\"best-guess\" estimate of workers′ average opportunity cost. To make a more conservative estimate, I assume that if workers did not apply to my second job, they were not willing to accept any wage below their initial posted wage. I categorize treatment group workers into five groups based on the wages they proposed for the initial treatment job. Then, I calculate an average opportunity cost for each group using the fraction of workers that applied to the $\\$0.75$ $\\$1$ ,and $\\$2$ jobs and their posted wages.18 The weighted average of these opportunity costs for the entire sample was $\\$1.49$  \n\nI have less information on firms' opportunity costs. However, as I estimate that the increase in firm profits was only about 5% of the increase in worker earnings, even assuming that firms did not benefit from the increased employment does not affect the welfare conclusions.  \n\nPanel C assesses the opportunity cost of the experimental jobs themselves. The opportunity cost of workers’ time is calculated as in the previous panel. In a traditional job, these costs would have been offset by the value of the output produced. However, in this experiment, the output had no value. Because workers were not expected to produce usable output, my time cost of employing them was relatively low (five minutes per worker).  \n\nEven under the conservative assumptions in the right-most column, the estimates suggest that hiring 952 randomly-selected, relatively inexperienced workers for a meaningless task increased market surplus by over \\$2,700 in the subsequent six months. As the benefits of this experiment for treatment group workers and the overall market appear to have increased steadily over time, extending the time frame over which the benefits were calculated would likely lead to larger estimates of the experiment's effect on market surplus. These calculations suggest that, before the experiment, novice employment on oDesk was inefficiently low.  \n\n# 6 Conclusion  \n\nThere is a debate in the literature over whether simply helping young and disadvantaged workers enter the labor market can improve their long-term employment outcomes or whether intensive skills training is required. This paper proposes that merely giving workers a first job benefits them by providing the market with information about their abilities, which in turn, makes them more valuable to frms. However, to the extent this information is public, its benefits accrue to workers, so firms may hire too few inexperienced workers. In particular, firms will hire too few inexperienced workers if hiring is costly, they do not receive the benefits of the information produced, and workers cannot fully compensate them for being hired.  \n\nThis paper uses a field experiment in an online marketplace to test whether giving workers a chance to demonstrate their abilities improves their labor market outcomes. In the experiment, workers were randomly selected to receive a job with a coarse evaluation, a job with a detailed evaluation, or no job. Simply giving workers a job substantially increased their subsequent employment rates, earnings, and reservation wages. Giving the market more detailed information about their job performance also increased their average earnings and reservation wages. These results are consistent with the paper's proposed mechanism: information about their abilities made workers more valuable to employers, but are inconsistent with several alternative mechanisms. Despite the fact that the experiment was not designed with this purpose, under plausible assumptions, it increased market surplus by more than its social cost, suggesting that, before the experiment, oDesk firms hired inefficiently few inexperienced workers.  \n\nThese results come from a particular marketplace and an important question is whether and how they would generalize to other contexts. The oDesk setting is probably most similar to traditional low-wage labor markets. It is characterized by high unemployment rates and its data-entry workers earn wages just above the allowable minimum. However, oDesk employers are likely more uncertain about the abilities of job applicants than offline employers of low-wage workers. They typically have less hiring experience, may be unfamiliar with credentials from foreign schools or employers, and have limited ability to verify these credentials. This suggests that the benefits of performance evaluations may be particularly large in the oDesk marketplace. On the other hand, oDesk has particularly low hiring costs. There is no positive minimum wage on oDesk and firms do not provide employment benefits or supplies. oDesk workers can be hired with the click of a mouse and fired instantaneously with no penalty. The tasks they complete are typically well-defined, easy to explain, and require no training. This suggests that the labor market inefficiency and the benefits of the treatments might be larger in a traditional labor market.  \n\nAssuming these results would generalize to traditional low-wage labor markets, there are several public policy responses that might reduce the inefficiency. First, a government could partially or fully subsidize firms for hiring young workers. Second, the government could itself hire young workers. For this to be maximally effective, the government would have to provide the market with honest measures of worker performance and ensure the jobs would not be negatively stigmatized. Avoiding stigmatization might entail hiring some workers already recognized by the market to be high-ability (as I did in this experiment). This would increase the program's costs but also the output of hired workers. Finally, the government or a subsidized firm could provide employment tests, simulated work experiences designed to reliably measure workers’ capabilities and diligence. These tests could be designed (as was the task in this experiment), to require little managerial time, but provide a useful signal of workers’ performance to potential hiring firms.  \n\nAs most oDesk jobs are offshored from U.S. employers to foreign workers, the paper's results may shed light on whether developing a reputation is a significant barrier to ofshoring, and on a grander scale, trade between foreign and domestic firms. Unlike in other forms of offshoring and international trade, the only significant barrier to transacting on oDesk is the dificulty of building a reputation. Firms offshoring offline may face significant costs of identifying available labor. Similarly, foreign and domestic frms wanting to trade must invest in identifying and communicating with each other as well as, potentially, in new plants and capital. In contrast, oDesk workers and firms can join the marketplace and search for each other costlessly and quickly. This experiment shows that the cost of building a reputation alone is sufficient to reduce the volume of trade, but, when reputations are established, trade volume increases. The extent to which the results of this experiment can be applied to more general trade contexts is an important question for future research.  \n\n# References  \n\nAcemoglu, D. and J.-S.

That is, if a worker with expected ability $\\hat{a}_{i}^{1}$ is hired, all workers with expected abilities $\\hat{a}_{i}^{2}>\\hat{a}_{i}^{1}$ will also be hired. All workers weakly prefer working at any non-negative wage to their outside options and, at the same wage, firms strictly prefer to hire workers with higher expected abilities. Similarly, if a firm with fixed cost $c_{j}^{1}$ hires a worker, all firms with $c_{j}^{2}<c_{j}^{1}$ also hire a worker.  \n\nSome agents accept their outside options: every firm prefers its outside option of zero to hiring a worker with negative expected ability at a non-negative wage. However, not all agents take their outside options: firms with $c_{j}$ arbitrarily close to zero and workers with arbitrarily high expected abilities prefer employment relationships with each other to their outside options. Thus, there exists thresholds $\\hat{a}_{w}$ and $c_{f}$ such that only workers with $\\hat{a}_{i}\\geq\\hat{a}_{w}$ and firms with $c_{j}\\leq c_{f}$ are in employment relationships. These inequalities are weak because of the assumption that indifferent agents enter the market.  \n\nMarket wages must equal $w_{i j}=\\hat{a}_{i}-b$ for some $b$ . If $\\hat{a}_{i}-w_{i j}$ were not constant for all hired workers, for some $\\varepsilon>0$ , there would exist a hiring firm that would benefit by offering a wage of $w_{i j}+\\varepsilon$ to a worker employed by another firm at a wage of $w_{i j}$ . Because the marginal firm and worker must earn zero profit and wages, $c_{f}=b=\\hat{a}_{w}\\equiv\\bar{c}$ . This $c$ exists such that the the market clears: as $c$ increases on $[0,\\alpha)$ , the mass of firms with $c_{j}\\leq c$ increases monotonically from 0 to $1$ , while the mass of workers with $\\hat{a}_{i}\\geq c$ decreases monotonically to $0$  \n\nThere are no profitable deviations from this equilibrium. Hiring firms earn expected profit $c-c_{j}$ from hiring any worker with $\\hat{a}_{i}\\geq\\bar{c}$ , which weakly exceeds their outside option. Firms with $c_{j}>c$ would earn negative profit from paying market wages. All firms would earn lower profit from hiring workers with $\\hat{a}_{i}<\\bar{c}$ at non-negative wages. No workers with $\\hat{a}_{i}\\geq\\bar{c}$ strictly prefer their outside option to market work. Veteran workers’ wages weakly exceed their outside options. If novices work, they earn $\\hat{a}_{i}-\\bar{c}$ in their novice period which weakly exceeds their total maximum earnings over two periods if they take their outside options: $0+\\beta(\\hat{a}_{i}-\\bar{c})$  \n\n### 7.2  Proof of Proposition 2  \n\nLet $l\\in[0,1]$ index workers and firms in each period such that only agents with $l\\leq l$ participate in the market. The utilitarian social planner maximizes  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\beta^{t}\\int_{0}^{\\bar{l}}(\\hat{a}_{l}-c_{l})d l\n$$  \n\nHere, $l\\in(0,1)$ . If $l=0$ , having frms with arbitrarily low fixed costs hire novices with arbitrarily high expected abilities would increase social surplus. If $l=1$ , having veterans with negative expected abilities take their outside options would increase expected surplus. There is a single-crossing property where if a firm with $c_{j}^{1}$ hires a worker, firms with $c_{j}^{2}<c_{j}^{1}$ also hire a worker. Thus, there exists a $c^{*}$ , such that all frms with $c_{j}\\leq c^{*}$ and only those frms hire workers. (This relies on the assumption that if entering the market and taking their outside options generate equal social surplus, agents enter the market.)  \n\nThe current-period expected social surplus from hiring the additional worker $i$ is $\\hat{a}_{i}-c^{*}$ Veterans will be hired if and only if $\\hat{a}_{i1}\\geq c^{*}$ . The social planner will employ novices if and Only if  \n\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0}-c^{*}\\right)}_{\\mathrm{Novice-Period~Surplus}}+\\underbrace{\\beta\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\hat{a}_{i1H}\\geq c^{*})\\times E[\\hat{a}_{i1H}-c^{*}|\\hat{a}_{i1H}\\geq c^{*}]}_{\\mathrm{Veteran-Period~Surplus}}\\geq0.\n$$  \n\nThe social planner employs all novices with $\\hat{a}_{i0}\\geq c^{*}$ . (Equation (1) holds for these workers.) If unemployed, these workers generate a maximum surplus of $0+\\beta(\\hat{a}_{i0}-c^{*})$ over their lives, which is less than the novice-period surplus generated from hiring them: $\\hat{a}_{i0}-c^{*}$ . If novices with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<c^{*}$ are unemployed, they will have $\\hat{a}_{i1}=\\hat{a}_{i0}<c^{*}$ and be unemployed as veterans, generating zero social surplus over their lives. If employed as novices, the left-hand side of Equation (1) gives the lifetime surplus produced: they will be hired as veterans with probability $\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\hat{a}_{i1H}\\geq c^{*})$ , in which case, they will generate expected surplus $E[\\hat{a}_{i1H}-c^{*}|\\hat{a}_{i1H}\\geq c^{*}]$  \n\nA $c^{*}$ exists that clears the market: as $c$ increases on $[0,\\infty)$ , the mass of frms with $c_{j}\\leq c$ increases monotonically from O to 1 while the mass of veterans with $\\hat{a}_{i1}\\geq c$ and the mass of novices for whom Equation (1) holds decrease monotonically to $0$  \n\nIt must be that $c^{*}>\\bar{c}$ . For any hiring threshold $c$ , more novices and veterans are hired in the social planner's solution than in the market equilibrium. (The social planner's solution employs some novices with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<c$ , which leads to more veterans with $\\hat{a}_{i1}\\geq c$ ）Thus, if $c^{*}\\leq\\bar{c}$ , the social planner's solution would have more employed workers than hiring firms. The social planner's solution must employ more novices than the market equilibrium. If it did not, it would employ fewer veterans than the market equilibrium. Both the social planner's solution and the market equilibrium hire novices with $\\hat{a}_{i0}\\geq c^{*}$ . A higher fraction of these workers will be hired as veterans in the market equilibrium, since $c^{*}>{\\bar{c}}$ . The remaining novices hired by the market have $\\hat{a}_{i0}\\geq\\bar{c}$ , so they have more than a 50% chance of being rehired as veterans, while the remaining novices hired by the social planner have $\\hat{a}_{i1}<c^{*}$ ,SO they have less than a $50\\%$ chance of being rehired as veterans. The social planner's solution cannot hire fewer veterans and no more novices than the market equilibrium while having more hiring frms ( $c^{*}>c$ )  \n\n### 7.3 Proof of Proposition 3  \n\nRelative to remaining in the market equilibrium, being hired by Employer C does not affect the expected veteran-period employment outcomes of novices with $\\hat{a}_{i0}\\geq\\bar{c}$ . These workers will be hired and receive an output signal with the same distribution whether Employer C hires them or they remain in the market. In contrast, if not hired by Employer C, novices with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ will not be hired. Thus, they will have $\\hat{a}_{i1}=\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ and will be unemployed with no earnings and with reservation wages equal to their outside option of zero in their veteran periods. However, if hired by Employer C, some will receive suficiently high output signals that their veteran-period expected abilities will exceed $c$ . They will be employed in their veteran periods with positive earnings and reservation wages.  \n\nNow, I consider the effect of being hired by Employer D relative to Employer C. The market uses Bayesian updating to determine its expectation of workers abilities. The market's expectations of worker $i$ 's ability if she is hired by Employer C $(\\hat{a}_{i1C}$ )and Employer D $\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1D}\\right)$ ,respectively, are:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\hat{a}_{i1C}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sigma_{M}^{2}\\hat{a}_{i0}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\hat{y}_{i M}}{\\sigma_{M}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\hat{a}_{i1D}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\hat{a}_{i0}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\hat{y}_{i D}}{\\sigma_{D}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe terms $\\hat{y}_{i M}$ and $\\hat{y}_{i D}$ can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\hat{y}_{i M}}&{=}&{a_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i M}=\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\varepsilon_{i a}\\right)+\\varepsilon_{i M}}\\ {\\hat{y}_{i D}}&{=}&{a_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i M}=\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\varepsilon_{i a}\\right)+\\varepsilon_{i D}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSubstituting these expressions into the above equations gives  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\hat{a}_{i1C}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sigma_{M}^{2}\\hat{a}_{i0}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\varepsilon_{i a}+\\varepsilon_{i M}\\right)}{\\sigma_{M}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\hat{a}_{i1C}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\hat{a}_{i0}+\\frac{\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\left(-\\varepsilon_{i a}+\\varepsilon_{i M}\\right)}{\\sigma_{M}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\hat{a}_{i1C}}}&{{\\sim}}&{{N\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0},\\frac{\\sigma_{a i}^{4}}{\\sigma_{M}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\hat{a}_{i1D}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\hat{a}_{i0}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\varepsilon_{i a}+\\varepsilon_{i D}\\right)}{\\sigma_{D}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\hat{a}_{i1D}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\hat{a}_{i0}+\\frac{\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\left(-\\varepsilon_{i a}+\\varepsilon_{i D}\\right)}{\\sigma_{D}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\hat{a}_{i1D}}}&{{\\sim}}&{{N\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0},\\frac{\\sigma_{a i}^{4}}{\\sigma_{D}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince $\\sigma_{D}^{2}<\\sigma_{M}^{2}$ , the distribution of $\\hat{a}_{i1D}$ is a mean-preserving spread of the distribution of $\\hat{a}_{i1C}$ . Worker's expected veteran-period earnings and reservation wages are $E\\left[\\operatorname*{max}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1}-\\bar{c},0\\right)\\right]$ a convex function of $\\hat{a}_{i1}$ . Thus, by Jensen's inequality, $E\\left[\\operatorname*{max}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1D}-\\bar{c},0\\right)\\right]>E\\left[\\operatorname*{max}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}-\\bar{c},0\\right)\\right]$ being hired by Employer D relative to Employer C strictly increases workers expected earnings and reservation wages.  \n\nA worker is employed in her veteran period with probability $\\mathrm{Pr}\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1}\\geq\\bar{c}\\vert\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right].$ The probabilities that a worker will be employed in her veteran period after being employed by Employers C and D, respectively are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\ge\\bar{c}|\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right]}&{=}&{\\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\bar{c}\\right)\\sqrt{\\sigma_{M}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}{\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}\\right)}\\ {\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1D}\\ge\\bar{c}|\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right]}&{=}&{\\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\bar{c}\\right)\\sqrt{\\sigma_{D}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}{\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}\\right)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Since $\\sigma_{D}^{2}<\\sigma_{M}^{2}$ , a worker with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ has a higher probability of veteran-period employment after being hired by Employer D, while a worker with $\\hat{a}_{i0}>\\bar{c}$ has a higher probability of veteran-period employment after being hired by Employer C.  \n\n### 7.4 Proposition 5  \n\nProposition 5 Conditional on novice expected ability, $\\hat{a}_{i0}$ , the effect of being hired by Employer $C$ (relative to remaining in the market equilibrium) on expected veteran-period employment, earnings, and reservation wages is weakly increasing in the market's initial uncertainty about the worker's ability, $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ . The effect is strictly increasing in $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ for workers with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ However, conditional on $\\hat{a}_{i0}$ , the effect of being hired by Employer $D$ (relative to being hired by Employer $C$ ) on ecpected veteran-period employment, earnings, and reservation wages is not monotonicin $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$  \n\nProof. First, I consider the effect of being hired by Employer C relative to remaining in the market equilibrium. Being hired by Employer C has no effect on expected employment outcomes for workers with $\\hat{a}_{i0}\\geq\\bar{c}$ . Thus, all that remains to prove is that the effect of being hired by Employer C is strictly increasing in $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ for workers with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ . The probability that a worker with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ who was hired by Employer C is hired in her veteran period is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\geq\\bar{c}\\right)=\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)\\times\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\geq\\bar{c}|\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)}\\ &{\\qquad+\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{y}_{i M}\\leq\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)\\times\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\geq\\bar{c}|\\hat{y}_{i M}\\leq\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)}\\ &{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\geq\\bar{c}\\right)=\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)\\times\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\geq\\bar{c}|\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)+0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe second line follows because if $\\hat{y}_{i M}\\leq\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ ,then $\\hat{a}_{i1C}<\\bar{c}$ . When, $\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}$ ， $\\hat{a}_{i1C}$ is strictly increasing in $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ . Since $\\mathrm{Pr}\\left(\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)$ does not depend on $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ ， $\\mathrm{Pr}\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\geq\\bar{c}\\right)$ is strictly increasing in $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$  \n\nSimilarly, workers’ expected earnings and reservation wages are  \n\n$$\nE\\left[1\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\geq\\bar{c}\\right]\\times\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}-\\bar{c}\\right)\\right]\n$$  \n\nwhere $1[]$ is an indicator for the expression being true. This can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)\\times E\\left[1\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\geq\\bar{c}\\right]\\times\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}-\\bar{c}\\right)\\left|\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right]}\\ &{+\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{y}_{i M}\\leq\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)\\times E\\left[1\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\geq\\bar{c}\\right]\\times\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}-\\bar{c}\\right)\\left|\\hat{y}_{i M}\\leq\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right]}\\ {=}&{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)\\times E\\left[1\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\geq\\bar{c}\\right]\\times\\left(\\hat{a}_{i1C}-\\bar{c}\\right)\\left|\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right]+0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAs above, the equality follows because when $\\hat{y}_{i M}\\leq\\hat{a}_{i0}$ ， $\\hat{a}_{i1C}<\\bar{c}$ . When $\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}$ ， $\\hat{a}_{i1C}$ is strictly increasing in $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ . Since $\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left(\\hat{y}_{i M}>\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right)$ does not depend on $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ , the right-hand side of the quation is sritly increasing in $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$  \n\nNow I consider the effect of being hired by Employer D relative to being hired by Employer C on expected earnings and reservation wages. Given the lack of closed form solutions to integrating the normal distribution, it is easiest to see the result by example. The distributions of $\\hat{a}_{i1C}$ and $\\hat{a}_{i1D}$ are given in Section 7.3. Let $\\sigma_{M}^{2}=2$ ， $\\sigma_{D}^{2}=1,\\hat{a}_{i0}=1$ , and $\\bar{c}=2$ . Then, expected earnings after being hired by Employers D and C are as follows for different levels of $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ ：  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>O2i</td><td>Earnings after D</td><td>Earnings after C</td><td>Earnings Difference: D - C</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.025</td><td>0.010</td><td>0.015</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>0.768</td><td>0.720</td><td>0.048</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>1.286</td><td>1.247</td><td>0.039</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nAs $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ increases from 1 to 10, the earnings and reservation wage benefit from being hired by Employer D relative to Employer C increases from 0.015 to 0.048, but it decreases to 0.039as $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ increases to 20. Thus, the earnings and reservation wage increase from being hired by Employer D relativ to Employer C is not monotonic in $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$  \n\nFinally, I consider the effect of being hired by Employer D relative to Employer C on the expected probability of employment. Equation (2) provides the probabilities of employment after being hired by Employers C and D. For any $\\hat{a}_{i0}^{1}$ ,let $\\hat{a}_{i0}^{2}$ be defined such that $\\hat{a}_{i0}^{1}-\\bar{c}=$ $\\bar{c}-\\hat{a}_{i0}^{2}$ . Then, by the symmetry of the normal distribution  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{r}\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1D}\\ge\\bar{c}|\\hat{a}_{i0}^{1}\\right]-\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\ge\\bar{c}|\\hat{a}_{i0}^{1}\\right]=-\\left(\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1D}\\ge\\bar{c}|\\hat{a}_{i0}^{2}\\right]-\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\ge\\bar{c}|\\hat{a}_{i0}^{2}\\right]\\right).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus, if the effect of being hired by Employer D on employment is increasing in $\\sigma_{a i}^{2}$ at $\\hat{a}_{i0}=\\hat{a}_{i0}^{1}$ , then it is decreasing at $\\hat{a}_{i0}=\\hat{a}_{i0}^{2}$ and vice versa.■  \n\n### 7.5 Proposition 6  \n\nProposition 6 Being hired by Employer $D$ (relative to Employer $C$ ) weakly decreases workers’ veteran-period probability of employment, earnings, and reservation wages when $\\hat{y}_{i D}\\leq$ $\\operatorname*{min}(\\hat{a}_{i0},\\hat{y}_{i M})$ and weakly increases these outcomes when $\\hat{y}_{i D}\\ge\\operatorname*{max}(\\hat{a}_{i0},\\hat{y}_{i M})$  \n\nProof. Since expected earnings, reservation wages, and employment probabilities are weakly increasing functions of $\\hat{a}_{i1}$ , all I need to show is that when $\\hat{y}_{i D}\\leq\\operatorname*{min}\\bigl(\\hat{a}_{i0},\\hat{y}_{i M}\\bigr)$ $\\hat{a}_{i1D}\\leq\\hat{a}_{i1C}$ and when $\\hat{y}_{i D}\\ge\\operatorname*{max}(\\hat{a}_{i0},\\hat{y}_{i M})$ $\\hat{a}_{i1D}\\geq\\hat{a}_{i1C}$ . The difference in expected abilities after having been hired by Employers D and C is:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\hat{a}_{i1D}-\\hat{a}_{i1C}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\hat{a}_{i0}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\hat{y}_{i D}}{\\sigma_{D}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}-\\frac{\\sigma_{M}^{2}\\hat{a}_{i0}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\hat{y}_{i M}}{\\sigma_{M}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\\hat{a}_{i1D}-\\hat{a}_{i1C}}}&{{=}}&{{\\displaystyle\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\times\\frac{\\left[\\sigma_{D}^{2}(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\hat{y}_{i M})+\\sigma_{M}^{2}(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{a}_{i0})+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{y}_{i M})\\right]}{\\left(\\sigma_{D}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\right)\\left(\\sigma_{M}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\right)}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince variances are always positive, the sign of this expression will be determined by the sign of the terms in brackets. If $\\hat{y}_{i D}\\leq\\operatorname*{min}\\bigl(\\hat{a}_{i0},\\hat{y}_{i M}\\bigr)$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\big(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\hat{y}_{i M}\\big)+\\sigma_{M}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{a}_{i0}\\big)+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{y}_{i M}\\big)}\\ {\\leq}&{\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\big(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\hat{y}_{i M}\\big)+\\sigma_{M}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{a}_{i0}\\big)+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{y}_{i M}\\big)+\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i M}-\\hat{y}_{i D}\\big)}\\ {=}&{\\big(\\sigma_{M}^{2}-\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\big)\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{a}_{i0}\\big)+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{y}_{i M}\\big)\\leq0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSo, $\\hat{a}_{i1D}-\\hat{a}_{i C}\\leq0$ .If $\\hat{y}_{i D}\\ge\\operatorname*{max}\\bigl(\\hat{a}_{i0},\\hat{y}_{i M}\\bigr)$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\big(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\hat{y}_{i M}\\big)+\\sigma_{M}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{a}_{i0}\\big)+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{y}_{i M}\\big)}\\ {\\geq}&{\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\big(\\hat{a}_{i0}-\\hat{y}_{i M}\\big)+\\sigma_{M}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{a}_{i0}\\big)+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{y}_{i M}\\big)+\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i M}-\\hat{y}_{i D}\\big)}\\ {=}&{\\big(\\sigma_{M}^{2}-\\sigma_{D}^{2}\\big)\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{a}_{i0}\\big)+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}\\big(\\hat{y}_{i D}-\\hat{y}_{i M}\\big)\\geq0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSo, $\\hat{a}_{i1D}-\\hat{a}_{i C}\\geq0$  \n\n### 7.6 Proposition 7  \n\nI extend the model as follows: before each period, a worker observes her period-specific outside option. With probability $\\kappa>0$ , her outside option is $w_{1}>0$ ; with probability $1-\\kappa$ it is $w_{0}=0$ . She then decides whether to accept her outside option. If she does, she exits the market. Otherwise, she remains in the market. The market clears after workers make their exit decisions. There is some randomness in hiring: after the market clears, with probability $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ , each worker who has not received a job receives a wage offer of $\\delta>0$ such that $w_{1}>\\varepsilon\\delta$ This randomness refects the fact that some firms hire workers without reading workers? resumes. It affects the model only by ensuring that workers with outside option $w_{0}=0$ do not exit the market and thereby removes the multiplicity of equilibria.  \n\nProposition 7 Being hired by Employer $C$ (relative to remaining in the market equilibrium) weakly increases all workers’ probability of remaining in the market in their veteran periods and strictly increases this probability for workers with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ . Being hired by Employer $D$ (relative to being hired by Employer $C$ )increases this probability for workers with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<w_{1}+\\bar{c}$ and decreases this probability for workers with $\\hat{a}_{i0}>w_{1}+\\bar{c}$  \n\nProof. No worker with $w_{0}=0$ will exit the market. If she exits, she receives O, while if she remains in the market, her expected gain is at least $\\varepsilon\\delta$ . Workers offered outside option $w_{1}$ will remain in the market if and only if their market earnings $(\\hat{a}_{i1}-\\bar{c})$ weakly exceed their outside option: $\\hat{a}_{i1}\\geq w_{1}+\\bar{c}$ . Being hired by Employer C only affects novices with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$  \n\nIf these workers were not hired by Employer C, they would have $\\hat{a}_{i1}=\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}<w_{1}+\\bar{c}$ and would exit the market if offered outside option $w_{1}$ . On the other hand, if hired by Employer C, some would have sufficiently positive output signals that $\\hat{a}_{i1C}>w_{1}+\\bar{c}$ and they would remain in the market even with outside option $w_{1}$  \n\nI now consider the effect of being hired by Employer D relative to Employer C. The probabilities that a worker remains in the market after being hired by Employers C and D are,respectively  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}{{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1C}\\ge w_{1}+\\bar{c}|\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right]}}&{{=}}&{{\\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0}-w_{1}-\\bar{c}\\right)\\sqrt{\\sigma_{M}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}{\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}\\right)}}\\ {{\\operatorname*{Pr}\\left[\\hat{a}_{i1D}\\ge w_{1}+\\bar{c}|\\hat{a}_{i0}\\right]}}&{{=}}&{{\\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\hat{a}_{i0}-w_{1}-\\bar{c}\\right)\\sqrt{\\sigma_{D}^{2}+\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}}{\\sigma_{a i}^{2}}\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince $\\sigma_{M}^{2}>\\sigma_{D}^{2}$ ,when $\\hat{a}_{i0}>w_{1}+\\bar{c}$ , the probability of remaining in the market is higher after being hired by Employer C, while when $\\hat{a}_{i0}<w_{1}+\\bar{c}$ the opposite is true. ■  \n\n### 7.7 Proof of Proposition 4  \n\nIn the period after Employer C hires, there will be a larger mass of veterans with $\\hat{a}_{i1}\\geq\\bar{c}$ Employer C directly hires novices with $\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ . Because Employer C removes novices with $\\hat{a}_{i0}\\geq\\bar{c}$ from the market, the market hiring threshold adjusts from $c$ to $\\tilde{c}<\\bar{c}$ and novice workers with $\\tilde{c}\\le\\hat{a}_{i0}<\\bar{c}$ are hired. Some of these novices will have $\\hat{a}_{i1}\\geq\\bar{c}$ . In the subsequent period, the mass of workers with $\\hat{a}_{i}\\geq\\bar{c}$ will exceed the mass of frms with fixed costs $c_{j}\\leq\\bar{c}$ ， so  the hiring threshold will increase to $c^{\\prime}$ . Total employment increases with the mass of hiring firms. Wages fall, conditional on workers’ expected abilities, from $w_{i j}=\\hat{a}_{i}-\\bar{c}$ to $w_{i j}^{\\prime}=\\hat{a}_{i}-c^{\\prime}$  \n\nTo define the change in market surplus, I define $k\\in[0,1]$ which, in each period, indexes firms from lowest to highest hiring cost and workers from highest to lowest expected ability. That is, $k\\equiv F_{c}(c_{k})\\equiv1-F_{\\hat{a}}(\\hat{a}_{k})$ where $F_{c}(.)$ and $F_{\\hat{a}}(.)$ are the cumulative distribution functions of $c_{j}$ and $\\hat{a}_{i}$ , respectively. I define $k_{1}$ such that in the standard market equilibrium only workers and firms with $k\\leq k_{1}$ are in employment relationships ( $\\hat{a}_{k_{1}}=c_{k_{1}}=\\bar{c}$ ). In the period after Employer C hires, employment expands, so I define $k_{2}>k_{1}$ such that agents with $k\\leq k_{2}$ are in employment relationships in that period. Employer C's hiring also changes the distribution of $\\hat{a}_{k}$ to $\\hat{a}_{k}^{\\prime}$ . For all $c\\geq\\bar{c}$ , Employer C increases the mass of workers with $\\hat{a}_{i}\\geq c$ in the subsequent period. That implies that $\\hat{a}_{k}^{\\prime}>\\hat{a}_{k}$ for all $k\\leq k_{1}$  \n\nThe change in the subsequent period's market surplus due to Employer C is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\underbrace{\\int_{0}^{k_{2}}(\\hat{a}_{k}^{\\prime}-c_{k})d k}_{\\mathrm{After~Employer~C~}}-\\underbrace{\\int_{0}^{k_{1}}(\\hat{a}_{k}-c_{k})d k}_{\\mathrm{No~Employer~C~}}}\\ {=}&{\\underbrace{\\int_{k_{1}}^{k_{2}}(\\hat{a}_{k}^{\\prime}-c_{k})d k}_{\\mathrm{Increased~Employment}}+\\underbrace{\\int_{0}^{k_{1}}(\\hat{a}_{k}^{\\prime}-\\hat{a}_{k})d k}_{\\mathrm{Higher~Expected~Ability~Workers~Hired}}>0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBoth terms in the second line are strictly positive. The first is the increased surplus due to employment expanding from $k_{1}$ to $k_{2}$ . It is positive because $\\hat{a}_{k}^{\\prime}>c_{k}$ for all $k<k_{2}$ . The second term is the increased surplus from higher expected ability workers displacing lower expected ability workers at firms with $k\\leq k_{1}$ . It is positive since $\\hat{a}_{k}^{\\prime}>\\hat{a}_{k}$ for $k\\leq k_{1}$  \n\n## 8 Appendix B  \n\nThis appendix analyzes the treatments’ effects on workers’ application patterns. First, it assesses the treatments’ effects on the number and types of job applications workers sent. Then, it analyzes their effects on the probability that a given job application was successful.  \n\nPanel A of Appendix Table 4 displays the results of regressing (1) an indicator for sending at least one application in the two months after the experiment and (2) the number of applications sent in these two months on a dummy for being in either treatment group and an indicator for having prior oDesk experience. The table shows that the average treatment group worker was 24 percentage points more likely to send at least one application and sent 24 more applications than the average control group worker. Panel B displays the results of regressing the same dependent variables on a dummy for being in the detailed evaluation treatment. The regressions are limited to workers earning ratings of at least four in my treatment job. The results show that, relative to the coarse evaluation, the detailed evaluation did not affect the probability that a worker sent any application or the average number of applications she sent.  \n\nAppendix Table 5 analyzes the treatments’ effects on the types of jobs workers applied to. The first column of the table lists several objective features of jobs. Employers had to indicate whether each opening was an hourly (as opposed to fixed wage) job, its job category, and whether they had preferences for workers with certain credentials such as a given self-assessed English ability or level of oDesk feedback. I also observe the number of applicants to each job. Each characteristic is correlated with a job being more competitive. That is, when I consider the sample of applications experimental workers sent in the month before the experiment and separately regress a dummy for an application's success on each characteristic, controlling for worker fixed effects, each coefficient is statistically significantly negative.  \n\nEach cell in Panels A and B of Appendix Table 5 shows the results of a separate regression. Observations in these regressions are applications sent by experimental workers in the two months after the experiment. Panel A shows the results of regressing the indicated job characteristic on a dummy for being in either treatment group, controlling for a dummy for prior oDesk experience. It shows that being in a treatment group induced workers to apply to more-competitive jobs. Panel B shows the results of regressing the indicated job characteristic on a dummy for being in the detailed evaluation treatment, limiting the sample to applications sent by workers earning fours and fives in my treatment jobs. Similar to the results in the previous table, these regressions show that, relative to the coarse evaluation treatment, the detailed evaluation treatment did not change workers’ application patterns.  \n\nFinally, Appendix Table 6 evaluates the treatments’ effects on workers’ application success. Panels A and B consider the same sample of applications as the corresponding panels in the previous table. Panel A displays the result of regressing an indicator that an application was successful (multiplied by 100 for ease of viewing) on an indicator for being in one of the treatment groups and a dummy for having prior oDesk experience. The first column includes no worker or job controls. Because receiving a job affected both the set of workers who applied for jobs and the types of jobs workers applied to, Column 2 adds controls for the job characteristics listed in Appendix Table 5 and employer fixed effects and Column 3 additionally includes controls for worker characteristics and the wage the worker proposed for the job.19 Once these job and worker characteristics are included, receiving a treatment job is estimated to have increased the probability that a given worker's job application was successful by approximately $10\\%$ . While this regression controls for the treatments’ effect on selection into the regression on observable characteristics, this estimate will be biased if the treatments change selection on unobservable characteristics as well. In particular, if the selection on unobservables biases the coefficient in the same direction as the selection on observables, the regression underestimates the true effect of obtaining a treatment job on application success.  \n\nPanel B shows the results of regressing the same dependent variable on an indicator that a worker was in the detailed evaluation treatment. Columns 2 and 3 add the same controls as in Panel A. The estimates suggest that the detailed evaluation had a positive effect on the probability that a worker obtained a given job she applied to, but it is very imprecise.  \n\nThis is similar to the positive, imprecise effect the detailed evaluation had on employment.  \n\n![](images/d4bec01f0306bffda62dd037b430f98d584dcc9d9e7b0e892df3075eb9cf4de3.jpg)  \nFigure 1.

Through a nine-month empirical study of Uber driver experiences, we found that Uber does leverage significant indirect control over how drivers do their jobs. Our conclusions are twofold: First, the information and power asymmetries produced by the Uber application are fundamental to its ability to structure control over its workers; second, the rhetorical invocations of digital technology and algorithms are used to structure asymmetric corporate relationships to labor, which favor the former. Our study of the Uber driver experience points to the need for greater attention to the role of platform disintermediation in shaping power relations and communications between employers and workers.  \n\nKeywords: on-demand economy, Uber, design， platform, ridesharing, ridehailing, algorithm, data, labor, management, rating, surge pricing, entrepreneurship, independentcontractor,sharing economy  \n\nUber is a San Francisco-based company founded in 2009 that owns and operates a smartphone application for \"ridesharing,\" connecting drivers of privately held vehicles with riders who pay a fare set by the company. Uber is reputedly valued at $\\$62.5$ billion in its latest funding rounds (Newcomer, 2015), and is available in 195 cities in North America (Uber, 2016) and 68 countries worldwide (Uber Newsroom,  \n\n1 This project was supported in part by a grant from Microsoft Research FUSE Labs.

Lee, Kusbit, Metsky, and Dabbish (2015) provide the most granular independent look to date at the driving habits and preferences of Uber drivers, coining the term algorithmic management to describe the mechanisms through which Uber and Lyft drivers are directed. We extend that understanding of algorithmic management to elucidate on the automated implementation of company policies on the behaviors and practices of Uber drivers. A growing body of journalistic (Griswold, 2014; Hill, 2015; Hockstein, 2015; Johnson, 2014; Porter, 2015; White, 2015) and academic research has begun to examine the conditions of labor and work in online labor markets (Irani, 2015; Kingsley, Gray, & Suri, 2015) and the digital on-demand economy. Sociologists such as Zwick (2015) have critically assessed new terms, such as prosumer (Ritzer & Jurgenson, 2010), that seek to reify the consumer's role as a producer and manager of goods and services. Scholz (2013) along with the contributors to the volume Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory lay out a range and diversity of questions surrounding digitally mediated labor and new models of production and consumption. As Scholz notes, \"Web-based work environments have emerged that are devoid of the worker protections of even the most precarious working-class jobs\" (p. 1). Gregg (2015) observes that the asymmetries between app designers, owners, and the service providers-\"those who offer the infrastructure for labor but no stability or benefits to accompany it\" (para. 6)-are a defining feature of many of these on-demand companies.  \n\nOur research extends these critiques of platform-based employers by examining how Uber drivers experience labor under a specific regime of automated and algorithmic management. This work combines a qualitative study of Uber drivers in both digital and physical spaces with a design critique of Uber's technical systems and a discursive critique of its corporate communications (advertisements, public interviews, and written policies). We conclude that Uber's rhetorical invocations of digital technology and algorithms are used to structure unequal corporate relationships to labor that favor the former. Through tools such as dynamic, algorithmic pricing and a number of other elements of the Uber application's design, Uber is empowered via information and power asymmetries to effect conditions of soft control, affective labor, and gamified patterns of worker engagement on its drivers.  \n\n## Study Method and Scope  \n\nFor this case study, we performed archival and real-time analysis of posts by Uber drivers in online forums between December 2014 and September 2015. Drivers use these forums to learn tricks and tips for success on Uber's platform; compare and share practices and screenshots; complain socially about passengers and the company; and debate Uber's practices, including discrepancies between the passenger and driver apps (Clark, 2015; Rosenblat, 2015). Given that a driver's in-person contact with Uber staff is primarily limited to, if anything, the initial recruitment process (Uber communicates with its drivers almost exclusively via e-mail and text), these unofficial communication networks can function as primary sites for knowledge-building.  \n\nData were collected from five dedicated forums (three larger and two smaller).3 Of these larger forums, Forum \"UberDrive\" is a standalone website with 700-1,0o0 daily visitors.4 Forum \"UberOps\" is a closed-membership forum hosted on a social media platform with approximately 5,100 members (the numbers change marginally on a daily basis after increasing by hundreds over the nine-month period) and administrators that impose standards of basic civility. Forum \"UberCool\" is another standalone website: It has numerous participants and appears to be the largest, but the exact number of participants is unavailable.5 Approximately 1,350 total archival items were collected from these forums, documenting the activities and conversations of drivers through forum posts, interviews, and other personal contacts, including e-mail correspondence with Uber community support representatives (CSRs). To contextualize and build on the data gathered from forums, we also conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with sevendrivers.  \n\nThe experiences reported on these forums and described by our interview subjects are not necessarily representative of the Uber driver population as a whole. For instance, drivers who seek out and participate in online forums may be more strongly opinionated than other drivers, or may have had individual difficulties that drove them to seek help and information online. The ability to generalize from reported driver experiences is also complicated by the range of Uber services,6 the differences between drivers who rely on it for their primary income and have made significant financial and social investments in it compared with those who are hobbyists and work fewer hours, and how long Uber has been in operation in a driver's market. Yet, although these accounts may not describe every driver's experience, the evidence we have collected nonetheless reveals structural features of the Uber system that could potentially affect any driver using the application.  \n\n## What Uber Promises Drivers  \n\nUber recruits heavily, growing from 160,000 drivers in the United States in 2014 to 400,000 drivers a year later (Uber Newsroom, 2015). Retention rates are poor: Slightly more than half of drivers on-boarded in 2013 remain active (having completed at least one trip in the previous six months) on the platform a little over a year later, according to Uber's own data (Hall & Krueger, 2015, p. 16). Once approved, active drivers can log into Uber's system via a smartphone app to indicate that they are available to receive ride requests from passengers. Passengers pay a total fare for each ride via credit card directly to Uber. Uber later passes the payment on to drivers after deducting a commission, which generallyrangesbetween $20\\%$ and $30\\%$ for uberX, a \"safe rides fee\" (now a \"booking fee\"), and any additional fees based on local jurisdiction. Uber's policies require drivers to maintain a low cancellation rate,such as $5\\%$ in San Francisco (as of July 2015), and a high acceptance rate, such as $80\\%$ Or $90\\%$  \n\nOne of Uber's undoubted appeals for workers is its promise of \"flexible employment\" (O'Brien, 2015). Uber advertises to drivers that, \"With Uber, you have total control. Work where you want, when you want, and set your own schedule\" and \"Freedom pays weekly.\" In a 2015 survey commissioned by thecompany, $85\\%$ of respondents agreed that flexibility was a major motivator for driving for Uber (Hall $\\&$ Krueger, 2015, p. 11). The rhetorical markers of freedom, flexibility, and entrepreneurship enabled through an app-based platform are further hallmarks of the on-demand economy, and, in the case of Uber, they have proven broadly successful (Griffith, 2015). The promotion of entrepreneurship and freedom permits employers, the public, and regulators to imagine that workers \"work by un-coerced choice\" (Irani, 2015, p. 227). Yet, the labor that Uber drivers do is shaped by the company's deployment of a variety of design decisions and information asymmetries via the application to effect a \"soft control\" over workers' routines (Boltanski & Chiapello, 1999/2007; Deleuze, 1990).  \n\nUber refers to drivers as \"driver-partners,\" thus disassociating the company from an employeremployee relationship. Drivers in this study generally treated the language as either a formality or hypocrisy, as irrelevant, or as a lever to press negotiations for more autonomy. The terms partner and sharing economy and even rideshare suggest that Uber and its drivers possess a mutual commitment to common goals (Gregg, 2011, p. 85), despite the significant information and power asymmetries between the two. In Uber's contract with its UK-based drivers, drivers are instead legally framed as consumers: \"Customer [driver] is authorized to provide Transportation Services . . .\" (Uber B.V., 2015). The term customers specifies that drivers are \"end-users\" of the application, similar to passengers, which potentially obviates their role and rights as workers.  \n\nUber, like other companies in the on-demand economy (Smith & Leberstein, 2015), uses its identity as both a platform and a technology company to define its role (Gillespie, 2010) as a neutral intermediary that facilitates access to underused and undercommoditized goods and services (Lobel, 2015, p. 1; Lowrey, 2015). Uber claims in its contract with drivers that it is $\\\"a$ technologyservices provider that does not provide transportation service\" (Uber Technologies, 2014). In response to multiple lawsuits against Uber alleging that it discriminates against blind and disabled passengers, Uber has argued that the Americans With Disabilities Act did not apply to it as it does to taxi companies because it is a technology, and not a transportation, company (Strochlic, 2015).7  \n\nThe most explicit legal tensions in which the company is embroiled are highlighted by a class action lawsuit in California, which effectively contests the neutrality of Uber's relationship to its drivers: The plaintiffs (drivers) assert that they should be classified as employees, not independent contractors (O'Connor, Colopy, Manahan, and Gurfinkel v. Uber Technologies, Inc., 2015b). Uber's contract with its American drivers states that Uber \"provides lead generation to independent providers of rideshare or peer to peer passenger transportation services\" (Raiser, 2015, para. 9.2). In a legal brief Uber submitted in the  \n\nCalifornia employment misclassification lawsuit, Uber asserts that \"We make our money from licensing software. .. . And we happen to have a compensation model that, when they [drivers] use it successfully, we get compensated\" (O'Connor et al., 2015a, p. 16). This framing implies that any negative consequences are features of software connectivity. Yet, Uber's self-proclaimed role as a connective intermediary belies the important employment structures and hierarchies that emerge through its software and interface design.  \n\n## Power Asymmetries and Pay Rates  \n\nRegardless of the language used by Uber to describe its legal and rhetorical relationship to its drivers, an analysis of driver experiences with the company's system reveals numerous manifestations of algorithmic management. Most notable are the combination of blind passenger acceptance with low minimum fares and the algorithmic determination of surge pricing. These two features of the Uber system reveal, respectively, how little control Uber drivers have over critical aspects of their work and how much control Uber has over the labor of its users (drivers).  \n\n### Blind Passenger Acceptance and MinimumFares  \n\nWhen active Uber drivers receive a ride request through the system, they have about 15 seconds to accept it or reject it. When Uber drivers accept a ride request, they take on the risk that the ride's fare will not be profitable; yet, drivers are not shown destination or fare information before they accept a ride. Jason from Raleigh, North Carolina, who had driven for about a year, said, \"You're driving around blind. When it does ping, you might drive 15 minutes to drive someone half a mile. There's no money in it in that point, especially in my Suv.\" Although hiding the destination before a driver chooses to accept or decline a ride request can potentially prevent destination-based discrimination (Smart et al., 2015), it can also foster reduced wages for drivers.  \n\nIn addition, drivers risk \"deactivation\" (being suspended or removed permanently from the system) for cancelling unprofitable fares. Ron, an interviewee who had been driving in New Jersey and New York City for over a year, said,  \n\nShow the destination before. If we're independent contractors, we should have the right to refuse. If I look down and it's 3:00 in the afternoon and the guy is going to JFK [NYCbased airport], I'm not going to take it. When I get to the guy's location and I get to JFK, I'm not going to make $\\$40$ for 3 hours of work. .. . They tell us it's our choice whether to take a trip or not, so how can they penalize us for that?  \n\nBlind ride acceptance is made even more risky by Uber's imposition of minimum fares. In Savannah, Georgia, the minimum fare is $\\$5$ for uberX (as of September 2015). Uber takes a $\\$1$ safe rides fee off that amount and a commission of at least $20\\%$ on the remaining $\\$4$ . That leaves the driver with $\\$3.20$ at Uber's lowest commission, which does not account for any of the driver's expenses.8  \n\nThese structures of the Uber system contradict the rhetorical framing of drivers as entrepreneurs. Uber advertises that a driver can \"be your own boss\" and has made attempts to induce drivers to protest the regulation of ridesharing by sending them e-mails that say, for example, \"State leaders need to hear from entrepreneurs like you.\" In Uber's Newsroom (2014), Uber states, \"Our powerful technology platform delivers turnkey entrepreneurship to drivers across the country and around the world\" (para. 4). None of the interviewees we spoke with thought of themselves as entrepreneurs because of their work with Uber. As Mike, an interviewee from Savannah who had driven for Uber for two to three months, said,  \n\nEntrepreneur is, I feel like a bit of a stretch. I mean, I feel like the definition of an entrepreneur is, you know, having your own idea and taking off with that. I feel like Uber is just like a side gig, not any kind of entrepreneur endeavor. . . . I don't feel like entrepreneur is a great classification for drivers, unless you're running a business out of your Uber car, I guess that's something an entrepreneur could do.  \n\nUber's discourse of entrepreneurship may be tied to the legacy of a Silicon Valley environment where highly skilled and mobile workers could take on risks and trade-offs to be part of the start-up technology world (Neff, 2012, p. 24). However, this rhetoric of risk and reward has been retooled to suit a contingent of lower-income workers who are recruited to perform service labor under working conditions controlled by the design and affordances of Uber's platform.9  \n\nThe practices of blind rider acceptance and minimum fares are two manifestations of the larger fact that Uber has full power to control and change the base rates its drivers charge.10 Uber's agreement with its \"partners\" (drivers) permits drivers to negotiate a lower fare, but not a higher one (Uber Technologies, 2014).11 Base rates, as well as minimum fares, vary across cities. For instance, in New York City, uberX services as of September 2015 were $\\$0.40$ minute and $\\$2.15/\\mathrm{mile},$ with a minimum fare of $\\$8$ .In Austin,Texas, the minimum fare was $\\$2$ and theratewas $\\$0.18$ minute and $\\$1.10/\\mathsf{m i l e}$  \n\nWhen Uber sets low rates for routine work, incentive-based pay steers drivers into working under much stricter and less flexible conditions in the hopes of higher earnings, such as hourly wage guarantees which vary according to the terms of each guarantee, such as $\\$22$ perhourhor $\\$40$ perhour,butthese are moot if drivers earn the equivalent or more in fares. Uber does not disclose the criteria by which certain drivers are selected for hourly guarantees, but Uber Support CSRs explain, \"Some guarantees are only offered to a specific group of partners. We rotate these guarantees to make the guarantee structure as fair as possible.\" .The conditions for receiving this guarantee follow this typical template: RsVP or \"optin\" to the guarantee; accept $90\\%$ of ride requests, complete one trip per hour, be online for at least 50 minutes of every hour, and maintain a specified high rating during those trips. Additional requirements could be that drivers are required to start eligible trips from a particular location, such as the core of Los Angeles (Campbell, 2016b). Effectively, hourly guarantees function to schedule on-demand shift work, but the language of opt-in or RsVP buffers the narrative of freedom and choice that Uber promotes to its drivers, while simultaneously masking a hierarchy in which select drivers are invited to earn more based on opaque criteria. Drivers have the freedom to drive at \"flexible\" hours at lower rates, but their flexibility is tailored to and dependent on demand as well as on the viability of base rates.  \n\nWhen Uber implements lower rates, drivers express strong distrust of Uber's system and explanations. To promote rate cuts, Uber typically shows drivers graphs demonstrating that lower fare rates lead to a \"huge boost in demand, and partner earnings per hour increased by $25\\%$ -that's a lot of extra money!\" Uber's logic is that drivers will earn more through increased trip, and greater optimization of their time online, from the \"boost in demand.\" In reactions that echo other driver responses to rate decreases in other cities, including Austin, drivers in forums respond with incredulity, calling it \"Uber math,\" \"propaganda,\" and Orwellian double-speak. Drivers contend that they have to work longer hours and accrue additional expenses to earn what they made prior to rate cuts. The reactions drivers have to Uber's logic around rate cuts is echoed in other changes Uber makes to drivers' compensation structure. As interviewee Jason from Raleigh observed in 2015:  \n\nThey keep bumping around with the rates and the different terms of service. ... You gotta log in and all of a sudden there's new terms and conditions and you can't drive until you accept the new terms and conditions and if you're on your phone you have to really look try and read everything. I read it because originally they had the $\\mathsf{X}$ and then they had the XL platform here and then with the XL platform all of a sudden their percentage went from $20\\%$ to $28\\%$ . I sent 'em an $\\mathtt{e}$ -mail and said what's going on? You're not doing anything different. Why do you get an extra $8\\%?$ And they said you're gonna make more money and I said no, you're gonna make more money.  \n\nUber's position as a technology company that offers software to connect passengers with drivers implies that any emergent (and negative) effects of its system are a natural feature of connectivity rather than an enforced hierarchy or employment power structure. Yet, Uber has the power to carve out which parts of \"connected work\" are taskified as paid or unpaid services. For example, Uber advertises that passengers can retrieve items they leave behind in drivers' cars because of that connectivity, and it provides passengers with a masked phone number to contact drivers in such cases, but Uber does not advertise that drivers are not paid for the time and energy they spend returning items passengers have left behind. Uber even advises drivers that, $\\\"\\mathrm{u}_{\\mathrm{It}}$ is not acceptable to ask the rider for payment for returning their lost item.\" If a driver protests to Uber Support, a typical CSR response is, $^\\mathrm{w}\\mathrm{_I}$ understand that it does take you time to return items that passengers left behind in your car. On the Uber system, you are only paid for the trips that are requested through the Uber app.\" Some drivers say they might receive a fee of $\\$25$ Or $\\$10$ , or simply a \"thanks\" from Uber, but like fare acceptance, they are prevented from setting or even knowing the rate for their work. In essence, Uber communicates that some services have prices and some services do not, but the power for determining these distinctions resides with Uber alone.  \n\nSimilarly, Uber claims that it has the data to adjudicate disputes between passengers and drivers, such as for criminal matters such as assault claims (LaFrance, 2015) or smaller concerns such as payment/wage disputes. Its claim to adjudication is rooted in the notion that its data on both passengers and drivers are akin to an objective, third-party witness, and thus that its interpretation should be conclusive. Some drivers appreciate the accountability created by Uber's system of surveillance. As Sarah, an interviewee from Seattle, said,  \n\nThey actually log the exact route that you took. . . . Uber drivers pretty much knows they can see whatever route they took, I think taxi drivers have done that forever, they'll just take you for a ride. . . . I like that Uber and Lyft has a little more of a specific tally because they don't want them doing that to customers.  \n\nIn other cases, drivers perceive that Uber favors the passenger in adjudications, and even report having to gather their own data to prevent wages from being retracted. One interviewee, Larry, who drove near Austin, Texas, and had been working for Uber for 9-10 months, described one incident when he used his dash-cam footage to prove his story to Uber:  \n\nOnce I had driven some guy somewhere and as soon as I got home I had checked and Uber had cut the pay in like half because the guy claimed I took him on an inefficient route, so I sent Uber the footage of the entire trip and I explain to them that if you watch the video he actually directs me turn by turn, you know, where to go, and it's the most drunk he's ever been. They reversed them, and gave me back my money. . . . Uberwillalways $100\\%$ go with the customer because that's how they make business. But I don't think that should come out of the driver's pay, because it's just customer satisfaction.  \n\nDrivers in forums and interviews, including Sarah, express how they resist Uber's power of interpretation by tracking their trips with manual or electronic logs and dash-cams. Even in cases of disputed fares, drivers are only able to exert control on the wages paid for completed work after the fact. The power imbalance is quite clear: Uber can hold drivers accountable to the \"most efficient\" routes, but drivers need their own data to hold Uber accountable for the wages they are owed. On a larger scale, Uber's ability to set and change its rates and commissions unilaterally and without driver buy-in foments driver distrust and dissatisfaction with Uber's platform.  \n\n## Surge Pricing and Algorithmic Logistics Management  \n\nAmong drivers interviewed and posts collected from forums, the ambiguity and resistance surrounding \"surge pricing\" surfaced as the most obvious intersection of data collection and information asymmetry in everyday driver experience. Surge pricing is displayed to drivers through a type of heat map visualization, where the algorithmic assessment of supply and demand will temporarily raise fares for a particular geographic location (see Figure 1).  \n\nVisible to both riders and drivers, the creation of such surge pricing zones is billed by Uber as a means to ensure positive customer experience by enticing new supply to an area of high demand (Kedmey, 2014; Uber Technologies, 2015b). Uber's surge pricing patent (Lin et al., 2014) and its vernacular explanations contend that surge pricing prompts more drivers to get on the road (Uber, 2014) when demand is high, but there is some evidence that surge primarily redistributes the existing supply of drivers rather than adding to it (Diakopoulos, 2015).  \n\nSurge pricing is unreliable for drivers: Notably, pricing is based on the passenger's geolocation, not the driver's. Drivers travel to surge pricing zones in search of fares advertised at a given rate, but they can and do receive ride requests from passengers in other, adjacent areas. A driver may enter a zone that is surging at $3.5\\times_{\\cdot}$ , but receive ride requests at a lower surge rate, such as $1.5\\times$ . Some drivers report that passengers game the system by placing their pick-up location pin outside a surge zone, and then calling drivers to redirect them to their actual pick-up location. Drivers also noted that they would sometimes converge en masse at a surging area, find that supply was no longer too low, and the surge would disappear. Some drivers reported experimenting with trying to game these algorithms themselves, and many developed responses to surge pricing based on their experience with its duration, reliability, and potential reward in their respective locations. It is unclear whether surge is designed equally to optimize for satisfying passenger demand or for increasing driver earnings, but Uber's stance against \"surge manipulation\" by drivers suggests the former. In one e-mail exchange from September 2014, an Uber CSR advised a driver against surge manipulation by writing, $\\\"{\\mathsf{A}}$ passenger let us know that they felt you unfairly canceled their trip to wait for surge to kick in, or that you otherwise unfairly gave preference to surge trips instead of their request.\" The e-mail went on to advise that the driver risked deactivation if Uber received more negative passenger feedback. In effect, drivers are penalized for rejecting lower paid work in favor of higher paid work, which is illustrative of another constraint on their \"freedom\" as independent entrepreneurs.  \n\nUber claimed in 2014 that surge pricing \"affects a tiny minority of all Uber rides, less than $10\\%$ of all trips\" (Gurley, 2014, para. 6), but surge (algorithmic) pricing recurs in driver discussions as a central preoccupation, and it remains a popular incentive: Screenshots of surge rates and zones are often posted to forums to display enthusiasm for a pay lottery. \"Waking up dreamin' of surge. Haha.\" Others commented that they check the app for surge as soon as they get up in the morning. Some drivers are propelled into a similar emotional space as gambling or gaming (Cherry, 2012; Schull, 2012) by algorithmic pricing.  \n\nThrough surge pricing's appeal to the concept of algorithms and automated management, Uber can generate and coordinate clusters of labor in response to dynamic market conditions (Aneesh, 2o09, p. 356) without explaining the reliability of its cluster incentives or guaranteeing the validity, accuracy, or error rates of its labor deployments. Many drivers express frustration and enthusiasm alike for surge pricing because its very dynamism is characteristically fickle and opaque, a finding supported by Lee et al. (2015, p. 1609). \"Don't chase the surge\" is offered in forums as standard advice to new drivers. Uber's rhetorical appeal to algorithmic certainty and authority (Gillespie, 2014) also appears in the effective messaging that Uber sends to its drivers at key moments, such as when they are about to log off. Rather than an appeal from Uber's position as employer-\"We'd like for you to keep working\"-these messages cite the (presumably algorithmically derived) idea that demand is high in that driver's location at that exact time.  \n\n![](images/0e7fcdd86bab0a14c9d0683cdf8ef20d073083cbace02b44490dd4c7c1e75726.jpg)  \nFigure 1. Sample surge map. Red means that demand is surging, orange indicates that rising demand, andyellow shows moderate demand.  \n\nSurge pricing thus exists as one example of Uber's institutionalized nudging of the driver workplace as a method for leveraging \"soft control\" over driver behavior, which also includes heat maps, incentives, and frequent messaging. Messages urging drivers to stay online, or to go online, imply or state explicitly that it will surge because there is high demand are often posted to forums.  \n\nA sample push notification (see Figure 2) that drivers receive reads, \"Are you sure you want to go offline? Demand is very high in your area. Make more money, don't stop now!\" with the surge icon displayed above the message. Drivers' responses range from skepticism of exaggerated demand to an enduring willingness to continue, sometimes despite significant fatigue. Workers thus absorb the costs of being available, accessible, and responsive to their employer without being guaranteed paid work, echoing worker concerns regarding on-demand scheduling software (Kantor, 2014). Frequent nudges are a highly visible part of the \"choice architecture\" (Sunstein, 2014, p. 2) of the Uber system: Uber can steer drivers to work at particular places at particular times while maintaining that its system merely reflects demand to drivers, who have full freedom of choice to ignore Uber's authoritative nudges. If drivers are mere \"consumers\" of a lead-generation application, then nudging is just another form of informational advertising, but nudging that comes from an employer has a stronger managerial element of control. In addition, Uber's attempts, through algorithmic management and communications, to mobilize its supply of drivers to meet demand ahead of time complicate its claim that it operates as a neutral intermediary.  \n\nIn a report by Wired, an Uber spokesperson \"reiterated that surge pricing only kicks in when there are too many requests made by customers, in real time\" (Clark, 2015, para. 6). Travis Kalanick, Uber's founder, has made oft-circulated comments that describe its system as a reflection of the marketplace (Hwang & Elish, 2015). \"We are not setting the price. The market is setting the price,\" [Kalanick noted]. . . . We have algorithms to determine what the market is\" (Brustein, 2013, para. 5). Yet, drivers are both alerted to the presence of high demand by real-time surge pricing that occurs in specific geographic zones (Lin et al., 2014) as well as by predictive, speculative messages about future instances of high demand.  \n\nThe language Uber uses to describe surge pricing is often identical to the language it uses to describe predicted demand: Rhetorically, essentially predictive \"guesses\" about possible future demand are thus easily confused with real-time \"measurements\" of existing present demand. This rhetorical device is used by Uber to mobilize its workforce in a way that draws on drivers' experiences of surge pricing in real-time-with the implication that real-time measurements are made with a high degree of accuracyalthough the company does not indicate whether a real-time recommendation to go to a surge zone is as accurate as predicted surge (or \"high demand\"), or if it is a lower-confidence recommendation. Drivers posted many alerts about high demand and surge pricing to forums from a wide variety of markets. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, a sample text message read, \"[UBER ALERT] Happy hour demand is extremely high right now! Log into to your app and take advantage of the extra earnings. #UberOn.\"  \n\n![](images/278483aaddac76fb7147907100407303971870073b5b9e4c50f22d2b8c21de6a.jpg)  \nFigure 2. An example of the type of nudge delivered to a driver when logging off the Uber app.  \n\nIn New Orleans (see Figure 3), a predictive message in an e-mail from Uber read, \"GET READY FORA BIGWEEKEND IN NEW ORLEANS! There are lots of events in New Orleans this weekend where we expect Uber demand to be high! [emphasis added].\" The driver who posted it to a forum commented, \"Going out $\\$9$ IT SHOULD SURGE.\" In advance of New Year's 2016, one driver posted a received message to a forum that read, \"We also want to remind you that we predict New Year's Eve will be the busiest night of the year. With such high demand, it will be a great night to go out and drive!\"  \n\n![](images/b6c8f3110ffeffb4a3f55187dcff388f7e53c8bc2315faa4c046731d6bbca458.jpg)  \nFigure 3. An example of Uber's predictive messages to drivers.  \n\nWhen demand does not reflect Uber's predictions, drivers express frustration and distrust in Uber and in surge pricing generally. Next to an image of his car on the surge map, one driver posted to a forum, \"Waiting in this surge for 30 min and not one ping!!!\" echoing similar sentiments from other drivers. In a rare articulation from Uber that predictive demand does not imply the same accuracy of realtime notices of high demand, we highlight the following exchange: A driver asked, \"Why send messages to me saying it is the biggest night of the year when everything is dead?\" The CSR replied, \"We try to predict how busy it is going to be based on the historical data from previous years. This is never going to be $100\\%$ accurate.\" After building a system to nudge drivers, Uber's disavowal of its own predictions is ironic, but also underscores how much control both parties understand Uber to have over the rhythm of a driver's everyday labor.  \n\nThe gamic elements of behavioral engagement tools, such as surge pricing, the conflation of realtime and predictive demand, and blind passenger acceptance, illustrate the multifaceted ways that Uber influences the relationship between supply and demand. These gamic elements also support the notion that Uber is not responsible for inconsistencies in its system; rather, automated functions, such as algorithmic pricing or blind passenger acceptance, are part of the interaction design. Yet, this system is premised on denying drivers access to certain key pieces of information that would otherwise help them make informed choices about their decisions.  \n\n## Information Management and Rated Labor  \n\nThe lines of communication between Uber and its drivers are based on a profound information asymmetry. Whereas numerous channels filter data up from drivers and riders to the corporate system, the paths for drivers to request information from Uber are limited and distributed through decentralized support centers. Drivers can make inquiries and usually receive template responses, but they are not empowered to negotiate the terms of their work by communicating to a representative of higher management. Uber's active voice is relegated to Uber Help or Uber Support through CSRs, who communicate to drivers via e-mail. CsRs represent Uber in name, but some are outsourced abroad to the Philippines (Horwitz, 2015); in the United States, some CSRs work for Uber' but are technically employed by staffing agencies such as ZeroChaos (Anonymous, 2015; Bhuiyan, 2016; Horwitz, 2015). The responses they deliver often lack a nuanced understanding of the context or challenges of the work, and drivers have to be persistent to get the answers they seek to questions without a template response. Some believe that software is creating initial responses based on the keywords in their text, and they refer to CSRs as \"Uber's robots.\" The responses drivers receive often resemble generic FAQs, and some drivers write \"escalate to manager\" in the body of their text in the hopes of flagging a human supervisor more quickly.  \n\nThe role of the CSR more closely resembles customer service than management, an indication of Uber's larger trend of treating drivers not like employees or even contractors, but as the customers of a \"free\" service. Although drivers primarily communicate with Uber by e-mail, there is no managerial correspondent empowered with the role of \"foreman\" to mediate drivers' frustrations with the company. And because there are no formal managers to oversee the quality of individual drivers' job performance, Uber's system recruits passengers to perform a type of managerial assessment through driver ratings. The automation of many managerial functions in the Uber system does not obviate the drivers' need for an Uber representative who is empowered to mediate their concerns in ways that CSRs cannot. A contextually aware manager able to explain what is happening to the software-based infrastructure of such work would be one way to build trust in platform-worker relations, for Uber and other similar companies.  \n\n### Driver Ratings and Surveillance  \n\nIn the driver rating system offered to riders, passengers are empowered to act as middle managers over drivers, whose ratings directly impact their employment eligibility (Fuller & Smith, 1991; Stark & Levy, 2015). This redistribution of managerial oversight and power away from formalized middle management (Castells, 2ooo) and toward consumers is part of a broader trend in flexible labor: Companies or platforms can create expectations about their service that workers must fulfill through the mediating power of the rating system. This business model is rooted in Taylorist traditions of using worker monitoring to identify and create new efficiencies in workflows (Beniger, 1989; Zureik, 2003). For laborers whose work is primarily mediated electronically, worker monitoring is more passive and the prominence of control is not as perceptible (Saval, 2014, p. 297). The loss of worker efficacy as power is transferred from labor to capital (Braverman, 1974) is not new or unique to digitally mediated labor, but digital spaces facilitate and scaffold new systems of monitoring and opportunities for remote control over workers.  \n\nTo achieve good ratings, drivers must modify their behavior to produce a homogenous Uber experience for riders (Bruder, 2015; Girard & Stark, 2002). Instead of imposing disciplinary measures on drivers, Uber controls how drivers behave through weekly performance metrics (see Figures 4 and 5) delivered after the fact of their work. This homogenizing effect highlights another tension between Uber's claim that drivers are entrepreneurs: They must deliver a standardized service.  \n\nThe ratings that passengers give drivers constitute the most significant performance metric according to driver discussions. Individualized metrics also foster a \"highly individualized sense of responsibility for one's own job stability\" (Neff, 2012, p. 28), even though drivers have limited control over how passengers interact with the rating system or how Uber assesses it. By design, systematic accountability for the whole interactive process (Leidner, 1999, p. 83) is downloaded onto individual drivers because passengers do not have the option to rate the Uber system in-app separately from their drivers.  \n\n![](images/f746afacb21809c8e8e40ad7da0025ac377cda5f21c018d55ea2aae587303b2b.jpg)  \nFigure 4. A weekly driver performance report.  \n\n![](images/62d7a0135116ac374559fd7ed919c93350e13ce0c32964cc8e65ddec8fcc363f.jpg)  \nFigure 5. An e-mail assessing a driver's rating in the Uber system.  \n\nPassengers have the ability to watch drivers as they approach, surveil their route, and even have the ability to track them after they have departed. The passenger app extends their role as \"the watcher\" (a stand-in for a traditional manager; Fuller & Smith, 1991; Stark & Levy, 2015). Passengers, who are also rated by drivers (Price, 2015), have begun to learn that they are empowered in Uber's system in part because of this literal oversight of drivers. Drivers need to maintain a rating of around $4.6/5$ toremain active on the app, although this requirement can vary by city. Passengers rate drivers on a scale of one to five stars, and drivers' ratings are averaged to reflect their last 500 rated trips, although some drivers receive deactivation notices if their previous 25 or 50 trips receive low ratings.  \n\nEven though drivers know ratings are averaged and that one rating should not make a difference, drivers express much care and dissatisfaction anytime their rating goes down. A typical comment is, \"What's the formula to get these results??!\" Drivers throughout the course of our study reflected that even when their behavior was unchanged, they would invariably experience a drop in their ratings and were unable to protest successfully to have low ratings (that they perceived they received unfairly) removed. A common sentiment is that passenger education on the rating system is low. Some drivers try to educate passengers, such as relaying that $\"4\"$ is a failing grade through in-car signs or in conversation.  \n\nThe result of these metrics' effect on employment behavior can also be seen in the ways drivers treat passengers. Once a passenger is in the car, drivers often provide them bottled water or offer chargers for their smartphones. Drivers try to gauge whether customers want to speak or if they would prefer to stare at their smartphones, using a combination of friendly conversational attempts with eye contact and general demeanor to guess their passenger's preferences. These behaviors on the part of Uber drivers are classic examples of what sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild (2003) has identified as \"emotional labor,\" whereby service workers like taxi drivers (Facey, 2010, p. 1265) or flight attendants suppress or contain their emergent emotions to present a placating or welcoming demeanor to customers, regardless of that customer's reciprocal emotional state. This behavior is partial compensation by drivers for Uber's overt lack of communication with passengers about the function of driver ratings. Drivers in the Uber system perform emotional labor in exchange for ratings instead of tips. Uber strongly discourages the cultural practice of tipping that historically underwrites taxi labor in the United States (Hansen $\\&$ Jesperson, 2013; Lynn, 2015). Some drivers, in response to rate cuts, discuss how they no longer go to the expense of providing bottles of water and snacks, but they express concerns that their ratings will be lower compared with their peers.  \n\nAlthough rating systems can be billed as a way to build and scale trust and accountability in platforms, they have other impacts on employment opportunities. Uber's driver rating feature dovetails with another managerial technique meant to structure and control the etiquette and uniformity of drivers' behavior. Uber will send routine messages, as demonstrated in Figure 6, to drivers that recommend that passengers give low or high ratings to drivers who behave in particular ways. This feedback is carefully designed to be indirect, presumably to avoid the appearance of a company policy-instead framed as the results of empirical data. The advice Uber provides about how passengers rate may be valid, but the way the advice is delivered has the effect of creating confusion between what Uber expects of its drivers (as opposed to what it merely suggests). Uber denies that the rating system has the substantive effect of mediating company policies. In its ongoing employment misclassification lawsuit, Uber describes how it provides \"suggestions that, if implemented, may (or may not) help them [drivers] raise their star rating. . .. Yet, some drivers, like Plaintiffs, believe they are required to follow these suggestions\" (Uber B.V., 2015, p. 7). The power of a nudge directed by an employer at a worker, however, has a stronger element of control than a suggestion directed at a customer.  \n\n## PROBLEMSREPORTED  \n\nThere were a few things riders in your city commonly reported.

Throughout our analysis, we have demonstrated how power and information asymmetries emerge via Uber's software-based platform through algorithmic labor logistics shaping driver behavior, electronic surveillance, and policies for performance targets. Through the Uber app's design and deployment, the company produces the equivalent effects of what most reasonable observers would define as a managed labor force. At the same time, the decentralized structure of Uber's systems and their rhetorical invocation of \"platforms\" and \"algorithms\" may render the impression that Uber has a limited managerial role over driver behaviors. Policymakers should take note of the power of automated systems to incentivize, homogenize, and generally control how workers behave within the system despite claims to systematic freedom or flexibility.  \n\nThe relevance of these power dynamics to drivers or those who aim to organize drivers, such as union leaders, may be variable. The role of platform disintermediation in shaping power relations and communications between employers and workers may be more relevant for drivers who rely on Uber as a source of primary income than for hobbyist or part-time drivers. Prospective interventions into the labor rights and protections of workers in the on-demand economy should note that a minority of drivers may be doing the majority of the work (Hall & Krueger, 2015, p. 20; Zatz, 2016) and thus stand to be most impacted by labor rights interventions. Any intervention into these labor considerations should account for the structure and emergence of employment hierarchies through Uber's platform, especially given that many businesses are seeking to use Uber's business model as a template going forward.  \n\nAs a case study in the emerging digital economy of on-demand labor, our analysis of the Uber driver experience signals the need for further study of how emergent technical systems are experienced by users of all stripes, constructed and deployed by companies, and represented in public and policy discourse. In particular, as labor laws and regulatory classifications develop in response to the provocations posed by on-demand companies to existing regulations, it is important to recognize that each of these companies will foster different experiences for workers, and these distinctions should be examined before drawing broad conclusions about the applicability of existing laws to them. More work is needed to translate these insights into deployable changes - including new regulations or modifications to existing ones-and must involve the joint participation of regulators (such as the Federal Trade Commission), policy makers, decision makers at Uber, and passengers and drivers themselves.  \n\n# References  \n\nAnderson, D.

To understand both the policies implemented and the accompanying political conflict, we need to know who supports more or less-restrictionist policies and why. Preferences surely depend on a host of considerations including political ideology, ethnic and racial identity, and expectations about the economic impact of new immigrants. Among economic considerations, the anticipated effect of immigration on wages is likely to play a key role, as current factor income is a major determinant of individual economic welfare. Because current factor income depends primarily on individual skill levels, there may be a significant link from skills to wages to immigration-policy preferences.  \n\nDifferent economic models, however, make contrasting predictions about the nature of this link. In the \"multi-cone\" Heckscher-Ohlin model of international trade, immigrants sometimes have no impact on native wages. \"Factor-proportions analysis,\" a framework often used by labor economists researching immigration, predicts that immigrants pressure the wages of similarlyskilled natives nationwide. \"Area analysis,\" an alternative framework in the labor literature, predicts that immigrants pressure the wages of similarly-skilled natives who reside in gateway communities where immigrants settle. In short, there is theoretical uncertainty about the wagesmediated link between skills and preferences in addition to the empirical uncertainty regarding whether individuals consider labor-market competition when evaluating immigration policy.1  \n\nIn this paper we provide new evidence on the determinants of individual immigration-policy preferences and on what these preferences imply about how economies absorb immigrants. We use a direct measure of these preferences obtained from the 1992 National Election Studies (NES) survey (Miller 1993), an extensive survey of current political opinions based on an individual-level stratified random sample of the U.S. population. Our direct measure is responses of U.S. citizens to a question asking about the number of immigrants U.S. policy should permit. Building on the NES survey, we construct an individual-level data set identifying both stated immigration-policy preferences and potential immigration exposure through several channels. We then evaluate how these preferences vary with individual characteristics that alternative theories predict might matter.  \n\nWe have two main empirical results. First, less-skilled workers are significantly more likely to prefer limiting immigrant inflows into the United States. This result is robust to several different econometric specifications which account for determinants of policy preferences other than skills. Our finding suggests that over time horizons relevant to individuals when evaluating immigration policy, individuals think the U.S. economy absorbs immigrant inflows at least partly by changing wages.  Further, they form policy opinions in accord with their interests as labor-force participants. These preferences are consistent with a multi-cone Heckscher Ohlin trade model and with a factor-proportions-analysis labor model. Second, we find no evidence that less-skilled workers in high-immigration communities are especially anti-immigrationist. If anything, our evidence  suggests  attenuation  of  the  skills-preferences  correlation  in  high-immigration communities. These preferences are inconsistent with an area-analysis labor model.  \n\nThere are five additional sections to this paper. Section 2 relates our work to the politicaleconomy literature on immigration.  Section 3 presents alternative economic models of immigration-policy preferences.  The following section discusses the data and our model specifications. Section 5 presents the empirical results, while Section 6 concludes.  \n\n# 2 The Political Economy of Immigration Policy  \n\nPrevious research on the determinants of immigration policy in receiving countries has emphasized the variation in immigration politics across countries and over time (Joppke 1998, Kessler 1998, Perotti 1998, Money 1997, Freeman 1992 and 1995). There is general agreement that systematic differences in policy outcomes across countries depend on varying political institutions, divergent national histories of settlement and colonialism, and the different effects of a changing international context. Moreover, it seems clear that even within countries the character of immigration politics changes over time. For example, a country's interest groups can dominate the policymaking process during some periods while in other periods partisan electoral competition is central. In contrast to this observed variation across time and space, very little research has focused on the distribution of individual preferences over immigration policy. Who supports free movement? Who advocates further restrictions? We contend that only once these questions about preferences have been answered adequately can a convincing account of cross-country and overtime variation in policymaking be constructed.  \n\nAccounts of individual preferences can usefully be divided into economic and non-economic determinants. Non-economic factors include individual beliefs about civil rights and expectations regarding the cultural impact of immigrants. The civil-rights dimension of immigration-policy preferences has both a non-discrimination aspect as well as a more straightforward free movement of persons element. Individual policy preferences are also likely to depend both on the degree to which individuals think immigrants change native culture and on the desirability of those changes.  \n\nEconomic determinants are generally hypothesized to be a function of the aggregate costs and benefits of immigration, the fiscal impact on the public sector, and the impact of immigrants on native labor-market returns. This last consideration is arguably the most critical economic factor influencing individual policy preferences, and it is often the most controversial factor as well. Consequently, it is the main issue addressed in this paper.2  \n\nIn previous work, Goldin (1994) and Timmer and Williamson (1996) present historical evidence on the potential impact of labor-market outcomes on immigration policy. Goldin (1994) finds that House Representatives in 1915 were more likely to vote in favor of a literacy test to restrict immigrant inflows the lower were wage increases from 1907 to 1915 in the Representatives' district cities. Goldin interprets this as indirect evidence that immigrants' pressure on native wages contributed to tighter immigration restrictions. Pooling five countries from 1860 to 1930, Timmer and Williamson (1996) find that more-restrictionist immigration policies were significantly correlated with lower unskilled wages relative to average per capita income. They interpret this correlation as evidence that countries with more unequal income distributions tended to restrict immigration to maintain the relative income position of the less-skilled.3  \n\nIn contrast to the policy focus of Goldin (1994) and Timmer and Williamson (1996), Citrin, et al (1997) use individual-level survey data to study the immigration-policy preferences of a crosssection of U.S. citizens. Controlling for a wide range of factors that potentially shape preferences, they conclude \"that personal economic circumstances play little role in opinion formation\" (p. 858). Specifically, they find that labor-market competition does not influence preferences. Using information from a national poll, Espenshade and Hempstead (1996) find some mixed evidence that less-educated and lower-family-income individuals are more likely to support immigration restrictions. They interpret this evidence as suggesting that people care about immigration's labormarket impacts on wages, employment, and work conditions.  \n\nAll these studies provide valuable information on the economic determinants of immigrationpolicy preferences and political behavior. However, our work improves upon them in at least three important ways.  \n\nFirst, our study uses a direct measure of individual immigration-policy preferences. Some studies cited above infer from observed political actions or policy outcomes something about immigration-policy preferences. These indirect preference measures face the important limitation of being endogenous outcomes of the interaction between immigration-policy (and possibly other, e.g., foreign-policy) preferences and domestic political institutions. Policy preferences and institutions together determine policy actions, so the mapping from preferences to actions and outcomes is not unambiguous. Scheve and Slaughter (1998) discuss this point further.  \n\nSecond, our study draws heavily on the trade and labor-economics literature on immigration to test properly for the economic determinants of immigration preferences. We test three alternative models of how immigration affects the economic welfare of natives. In contrast, none of the related studies explicitly lays out any models of immigration. Instead, they all simply assume that immigration hurts natives via lower wages, unemployment, and other adverse outcomes. Many important issues have not been explored, such as whether immigration preferences are systematically different in gateway communities.  \n\nThird, our study uses measures of individual economic exposure to immigration that follow closely from economic theory. This issue applies most strongly to Citrin, et al (1997) and Espenshade and Hempstead (1996). Empirical labor economists commonly measure skills via educational attainment or occupation classification; our empirical work below uses both these measures.4 In contrast, Citrin, et al (1997) interpret educational attainment as a \"demographic variable\" rather than an \"economic factor.\" Although this choice has some justification in previous studies on the relationship between education and tolerance, we will demonstrate that education measures labor-market skills once other considerations such as gender and political ideology are controlled for. Citrin, et al (1997) measure skills with income and with eight dichotomous occupation variables. Only four of the eight cover working individuals, and these -- \"white collar,\" \"pink collar,\" \"low threat blue collar,\" and \"high threat blue collar\" -- are never defined or justified with reference to economic theory or evidence. Espenshade and Hempstead (1996) use dichotomous variables for educational attainment and family -- not individual -- income, with all specifications using both types of variables. Overall, these earlier studies use questionable skill measures, and they do not report specifications with single measures only nor do they test the joint significance of all skill measures together.  These uncertainties regarding measurement and specification suggest the need for further analysis.  \n\n# 3 Economic Models of Immigration-Policy Preferences  \n\nTo make the connection between individual economic interests and immigration-policy preferences we focus on how immigration affects individual factor incomes. Different economic models make contrasting predictions about the nature of the link from immigration to factor incomes to policy preferences. In this section we briefly summarize three alternative models: the multi-cone Heckscher-Ohlin trade model, the factor-proportions-analysis model, and the areaanalysis model.  \n\nAcross all three models we make two important assumptions. First, we assume that current factor income is a major determinant of people's economic well-being. Second, we assume that U.S. citizens think that current immigrant inflows increase the relative supply of less-skilled workers. As will be seen below, this assumption about the skill-mix-effects of immigrants is not explicitly stated in the NES question about immigration preferences. But this assumption clearly reflects the facts about U.S. immigration in recent decades. Borjas, et al (1997, p. 6) report that “on average, immigrants have fewer years of schooling than natives—a difference that has grown over the past two decades, as the mean years of schooling of the immigration population increased less rapidly than the mean years of schooling of natives. As a result, the immigrant contribution to the supply of skills has become increasingly concentrated in the lower educational categories.\" Thus, we are assuming NES respondents are generally aware of U.S. immigration composition.5  \n\nGiven these two assumptions, we think that the economic determinants of an individual's immigration-policy preferences depend on how an immigration-induced shift in the U.S. relative endowment towards less-skilled workers affects that individual's factor income. To maintain focus on equilibrium wage determination, in all models we assume that wages are sufficiently flexible to ensure full employment. This allows us to abstract from unemployment, both equilibrium and frictional, though unemployment will be considered in our empirical work. To maintain focus on different skill groups, in all models we assume just two factors of production, skilled labor and unskilled labor. This keeps our analysis as simple as possible.6  \n\n## 3.1TheMulti-ConeHeckscher-Ohlin Model  \n\nThe multi-cone Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) trade model usually makes two key assumptions. First, there is one national labor market for each factor. Thanks to sufficient mobility of natives (and immigrants upon arrival), there are no geographically segmented \"local\" labor markets. The second key assumption is there are more tradable products (i.e., sectors) than primary factors of production, with products differentiated by their factor intensities. Multiple products are essential for establishing many fundamental trade-theory results, such as comparative advantage.  \n\nWith these assumptions, in equilibrium a country chooses (via the decentralized optimization of firms) the \"output mix\" that maximizes national income subject to the constraints of world product prices, national factor supplies, and national technology. This output mix consists of both which products actually get produced -- i.e., the country's \"cone of diversification\" -- and the quantities of production. In turn, this output mix helps determine the country's national factor prices. The general intuition is that each produced sector has a world price and some technology parameters that both help determine national wages. In the standard case where the country makes at least as many products as the number of primary factors, national wages are completely determined by the world prices and technology parameters of the produced sectors. Wages do not depend on national endowments or on the prices and technology of the non-produced sectors.7  \n\nImmigration's wage effects depend both on the initial product mix and on the size of the immigration shock. Consider the standard case where the initial output mix is sufficiently diversified that wages depend only on world prices and technology. In this case, \"sufficiently small\" shocks have no wage effects. The country completely absorbs immigrants by changing its output mix as predicted by the Rybczynski Theorem: the same products are produced, but output increases (decreases) in the unskill-intensive (skill-intensive) sectors.  Wages do not change because the set of products does not change. This insensitivity of national wages to national factor supplies Leamer and Levinsohn (1995) call the Factor-Price-Insensitivity (FPI) Theorem.8  \n\nWith \"sufficiently large\" immigration shocks, however, national wages do change. Large enough shocks lead the country to make a different set of products. Different products entail different world prices and technology parameters influencing national wages -- and thus different wages. Overall, a country absorbs large immigration shocks by changing both its output mix and its wages. In the literature on U.S. immigration, Hanson and Slaughter (1999) present evidence of immigration-related output-mix effects among U.S. states.  \n\nFigure 1 displays the national labor market for the case of an HO world with three products. The distinguishing feature is the shape of relative labor demand. It has two perfectly elastic portions, each of which corresponds to a range of endowments for which FPI holds. The national output mix varies along the demand schedule. A different set of two products is made on each elastic part; accordingly, different relative wages prevail on each elastic part. On the downwardsloping portions the country makes only one product. Along these portions output-mix changes are not possible, so immigrants must price themselves into employment by changing wages. Point $\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{o}}$ designates the initial labor-market equilibrium, with relative labor supply ${\\mathrm R S}_{\\mathrm{o}}$ and relative wages $(\\mathrm{w_{s}/w_{u}})_{0}$ . Two immigration shocks are shown. The \"sufficiently small\" immigration shock shifts ${\\mathrm R S}_{\\mathrm{o}}$ to RS'. Relative wages do not change, as immigrants trigger Rybczynski output-mix effects. The \"sufficiently large\" shock shifts ${\\mathrm R S}_{\\mathrm{o}}$ to RS\". The country now produces a new set of products. As a result the unskilled wage falls relative to the skilled wage (to $\\left({\\mathrm{w_{s}/w_{u}}}\\right)^{\\mathfrak{n}})$ , and with fixed product prices this relative-wage decline will be a real-wage decline as well.9  \n\nThe HO model has different predictions about link between skills and immigration-policy preferences. If individuals think FPI holds then there should be no link from skills to preferences. In this case people evaluate immigration based on other considerations. If individuals think that immigration triggers both output-mix and wage effects then unskilled (skilled) workers nationwide should prefer policies which lower (raise) immigration inflows.  \n\n## 3.2 The Factor-Proportions-Analysis Model  \n\nLike the HO model, this model also assumes a national labor market. The fundamental difference between the two is this model assumes a single aggregate output sector. Under this assumption there can be no output-mix changes to help absorb immigrants. Accordingly, any immigration inflow affects national wages by the same logic described above. Lower relative wages for unskilled workers induces firms to hire relatively more of these workers. The greater the immigrant inflow, the greater the resultant wage changes. In the labor literature, studies using this framework include Borjas, et al (1996, 1997). These studies calculate immigration-induced shifts in national factor proportions and then infer the resulting national wage changes.  \n\nFigure 2 displays the national labor market for the factor-proportions-analysis world. Here the relative-labor-demand schedule slopes downward everywhere, with no infinitely-elastic portions where FPI holds. Initial relative labor supply is again given by the schedule ${\\mathrm R S}_{\\mathrm{0}}$ , with initial equilibrium again at $\\mathrm{E_{o}}$ and $(\\mathrm{w_{s}/w_{u}})_{0}$ . Immigration shifts the supply schedule back to RS', and the national skill premium rises to $(\\mathrm{w_{s}/w_{u}})^{\\prime}$ . Again, for fixed product prices real wages change, too.  \n\nThis model makes a single prediction about the link from skills to immigration-policy preferences: unskilled (skilled) workers nationwide should prefer policies to lower (raise) immigration inflows. This prediction can also come from the HO model without FPI. Accordingly, evidence of a link between skills and preferences is consistent with both models.  \n\n## 3.3 The Area-Analysis Model  \n\nLike the previous model, the area-analysis model also assumes a single output sector. The fundamental difference between the two is this model assumes distinct, geographically segmented labor markets within a country. This assumption is likely untrue in the very long run, but it may be true over shorter time horizons thanks to frictions such as information and transportation costs that people (both natives and immigrants upon arrival) must incur to move. \"Local\" labor markets are usually defined by states or metropolitan areas (many of which cross state boundaries). Each local labor market has its own equilibrium wages determined by local supply and local demand.  \n\nIf there is literally no mobility among local labor markets, immigrants' wage effects are concentrated entirely in the \"gateway\" communities where they arrive: immigration lowers (raises) wages for the unskilled (skilled). In contrast, in a national labor market immigrants' wage pressures spread beyond gateway communities. Natives can leave gateway communities when immigrants arrive; immigrants can move on to other communities; or natives can choose not to enter gateway communities as planned pre-immigration. In cases between these two extremes, immigrants affect wages everywhere but to a greater extent in gateway labor markets. The areastudies framework has guided a number of empirical studies of immigration. Studies such as Card (1990), Altonji and Card (1991), LaLonde and Topel (1991), and Goldin (1994) have tested for correlations between immigrant flows into local labor markets and local native wages.  \n\nGraphically, the area-analysis model also looks like Figure 2 -- but with the key difference that now this figure represents local, not national, conditions. Here, immigration shifts only the local relative supply of labor and thus depresses only local unskilled wages. Given this, the areaanalysis model predicts the following: unskilled (skilled) workers in gateway communities should prefer policies to lower (raise) immigration inflows. What about workers in non-gateway communities? With no geographic labor mobility over time horizons relevant to individuals when evaluating immigration policy, there should be no correlation between these workers' skills and their preferences. More generally, with some labor mobility workers in non-gateway communities should have qualitatively similar preferences but the skills-preferences link should be stronger among gateway workers. Less-skilled (more-skilled) workers in gateway communities should have stronger preferences for more-restrictionist (less-restrictionist) immigration policies than lessskilled (more-skilled) workers in non-gateway communities.  \n\n4 Data Description and Empirical Specification  \n\n## 4.1 Data Description  \n\nWe measure immigration-policy preferences by responses to the following question asked in the 1992 NES survey.  \n\n\"Do you think the number of immigrants from foreign countries who are permitted to come to the United States to live should be increased a little, increased a lot, decreased a little, decreased a lot, or left the same as it is now?  \n\nThis question requires respondents to reveal their general position on the proper direction for U.S. immigration policy. To apply our theory framework to this question, we assume that respondents think that U.S. immigrant inflows increase the relative supply of less-skilled workers. As we discussed, this assumption clearly reflects the facts about U.S. immigration in recent decades. We constructed the variable Immigration Opinion by coding responses 5 for those individuals responding \"decreased a lot\" down to 1 for those responding \"increased a lot.\" Thus, higher levels of Immigration Opinion indicate preferences for more-restrictive policy.10  \n\nOur theoretical framework hypothesizes that immigration policy can affect individuals' factor income according to their skill levels. To test whether skills are a key determinant of immigration policy preferences, for each individual we construct two commonly used skill measures. First, respondents were asked to report their occupations coded according to the three-digit 1980 Census Occupation Code classification. From the U.S. Department of Labor (1992) we obtained the 1992 U.S. average weekly wage for each three-digit occupation. Under the assumption that the average market returns for a given occupation are determined primarily by the skills required for that occupation, these average wages, called Occupational Wage, measure respondents' skill levels. As a second skill measure, the NES survey also records the years of education completed by each respondent, Education Years. Educational attainment is another commonly used measure of skills, so we use it as an alternative skills variable.  \n\nAs discussed earlier, Citrin, et al (1997) interpret educational attainment as a demographic variable rather than a skills variable. Below we present strong evidence that education measures labor-market skills once other considerations such as gender and political ideology are controlled for. Also, our mapping of occupation categories into average occupation wages captures skills across occupations much more accurately than the poorly defined occupation categorical variables in Citrin, et al (1997).  \n\nIn addition to skill measures, we need measures of where respondents live combined with information about gateway communities. For each respondent the NES reports the county, state, and (where appropriate) metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of residence.  We combine this information with immigration data to construct several alternative measures of residence in a highimmigration area. First, we defined local labor markets two ways: by a combination of MSAs and counties, and by states. In our MSA/county definition each MSA (with all its constituent cities and counties) is a separate labor market; for individuals living outside an MSA the labor market is the county of residence. Following the extensive use of MsAs in area-analysis studies and Bartel's (1989) finding that immigrants arrive mostly into cities, we prefer the MSA/county definition but try states for robustness. Second, for each definition of local labor markets we try three different definitions of a high-immigration labor market: $5\\%$ $10\\%$ , and $20\\%$ shares of immigrants in the local population. These immigration and labor-force data are from the 1990 decennial census as reported by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1994). Altogether, for each of our six primary measures we construct a dichotomous variable, High Immigration MSA, equal to one for residents in high-immigration labor markets. In the tables we report results for our preferred measure, the MSA/county- $10\\%$ definition. Alternative measures are discussed in the robustness checks.11  \n\nWe also constructed several measures of non-economic determinants of preferences. Following previous work in the political-economy literature, we include the following measures in our baseline analysis: gender; age; race; ethnicity; personal immigrant status; party identification;  \n\nand political ideology. Gender is a dichotomous variable equal to one for females. Age is a continuous variable. For race we construct the dichotomous variable Black, equal to one if the respondent is African-American. For ethnicity we construct the dichotomous variable Hispanic, equal to one if the individual self-identifies with a Hispanic ethnic group.   Immigrant is a dichotomous variable equal to one if the respondent or his/her parents were immigrants into the United States. Party Identification is a categorical variable ranging from one for \"strong Democrat\" to seven for \"strong Republican.\" Finally, Ideology is a categorical variable ranging from one for 'extremely liberal\" to seven for \"extremely conservative.\" In addition to these variables, for certain specifications we included additional regressors which we discuss below in the robustness checks.  \n\n## 4.2 Missing Data and Multiple Imputation  \n\nUpon constructing the variables described in Section 4.1 and combining them into one individual-level data set, we observed that there was a significant amount of missing data. In the NES survey some individuals did not report either occupation or educational attainment; for these respondents we could not construct skill measures. Missing data also existed for some of our noneconomic determinants of immigration-policy preferences. Across the range of models which we estimated, when we simply dropped observations with any missing data we generally lost between $40\\%$ and $45\\%$ of the total observations.  \n\nThis standard approach for dealing with missing values, known as \"listwise deletion,\" can create two major problems. One is inefficiency caused by throwing away information relevant to the statistical inferences being made. Furthermore, inferences from listwise-deletion estimation can be biased if the observed data differs systematically from the unobserved data. In our case inefficiency was clearly a problem. We also had little reason to think our data were missing at random, so we worried about biased inferences (see King, et al (1998a) for a detailed discussion).  \n\nAlternatives to listwise-deletion for dealing with missing data have been developed in recent years. The most general and extensively researched approach is \"multiple imputation\" (King, et al (1998a), Schafer (1997), Little and Rubin (1987), Rubin (1987)). Multiple imputation makes a much weaker assumption than list-wise deletion about the process generating the missing data.  \n\nRather than assuming that the unobserved data is missing completely at random, multiple imputation is consistent and gives correct uncertainty estimates if the data are missing randomly conditional on the data included in the imputation procedures. The approach has several variations but always involves three main steps. First, some algorithm is used to impute values for the missing data. In this step, m $(m{>}1)$ \"complete\" data sets are created consisting of all the observed data and imputations for the missing values. The second step simply involves analyzing each of the m data sets using standard complete-data statistical methods. The final step combines the parameter estimates and variances from the m complete-data analyses to form a single set of parameter estimates and variances. Importantly, this step systematically accounts for variation across the m analyses due to missing data in addition to ordinary sample variation.  \n\nThe first step in our multiple-imputation procedures was to create imputations in the missing data cells for all the variables discussed in Section 4.1. We based our imputations on 29 variables selected from the NES survey. These variables included all those used in our analysis as well as additional information from the survey which we determined would be helpful in predicting the missing data. Altogether we imputed 10 complete individual-level data sets.12  The exact imputation algorithm we used is known by the acronym \"EMis\" because to generate imputations it combines a well-known Expectation Maximization missing data algorithm with a round of importance sampling. King et al (1998a) provide a complete explanation of the use of this algorithm for missing data problems. Each of our 10 final data sets contains 2485 observations, equal to the actual number of individuals in the NES survey. Also, each data set contains the exact same non-imputed information--they differ only in their imputed values for missing data.  \n\nThe second step in our multiple-imputation analysis was to run various ordered probit models separately on each of the 10 final data sets. The last multiple-imputation step was to combine the 10 sets of estimation results to obtain a single set of estimated parameter means and variances. The single set of estimated means is simply the arithmetic average of the 10 different estimation results. The single set of estimated variances is more complicated than a simple average because, as mentioned above, these variances account for both the ordinary within-sample variation and the between-sample variation due to missing data. See King et al (1998a) and Schafer (1997) for a complete description of these variances.  \n\nTable 1 reports the summary statistics of our immigration-opinion measure and explanatory variables calculated by pooling together all 10 of the imputed data sets. The \"average\" value for Immigration Opinion was about 3.6, between the responses \"left the same as it is now\" and \"decreased a little.\"Also, $23.5\\%$ of respondents lived in an MSA/county with an immigrant concentration of at least $10\\%$ .13  \n\n## 4.3Econometric Model  \n\nOur empirical work aims to test how skills and other factors affect the probability that an individual supports a certain level of legal immigration. The level of immigration preferred by a respondent could theoretically take on any value, but we do not observe this level. We observe only whether or not the respondent chose one of five ordered categories. Because we have no strong reason to think ex ante that these five ordered categories are separated by equal intervals, a linear regression model might produce biased estimates. The more appropriate model for this situation is an ordered probit which estimates not only a set of effect parameters but also an additional set of parameters representing the unobserved thresholds between categories.  \n\nIn all our specifications we estimate an ordered probit model where the expected mean of the unobserved preferred immigration level is hypothesized to be a linear function of the respondent's skills, a vector of demographic identifiers, political orientation, and (perhaps) the immigration concentration in the respondent's community. The key hypothesis we want to evaluate is whether more-skilled individuals are less likely to support restrictionist immigration policies as predicted in the multi-cone Heckscher Ohlin trade model and in the factor-proportions-analysis model. Accordingly, in our baseline specifications we regress stated immigration-policy preferences on skills, demographic identifiers, and political orientation. In a second set of specifications we also include a dummy variable indicating whether or not the respondent lives in a high-immigration area and an interaction term between this indicator and the respondent's skills. With these second specifications we can test whether the skills-immigration correlation is strongest in highimmigration labor markets as predicted in the area-analysis model.  \n\n# 5 Empirical Results  \n\n## 5.1 Testing How Skills Affect Immigration-Policy Preferences  \n\nOur initial specifications, estimated on the entire sample, allow us to test the HO and factorproportions-analysis models. Table 2 presents the results, where in Model 1 we measure skills with Occupational Wage and in Model 2 we use Education Years. The key message of Table 2 is that by either measure, skill levels are significantly correlated with ImmigrationOpinion at at least the $99\\%$ level. Less-skilled (more-skilled) people prefer more-restrictionist (less-restrictionist) immigration policy. This skills-preferences link holds conditional on a large set of plausible noneconomic determinants of Immigration Opinion. Among these other regressors Gender, Age, Hispanic, and Party Identification are insignificantly different from zero. Black and Immigrant are significantly negative: blacks, and the group of immigrants plus children of immigrants, prefer less-restrictionist immigration policy. Ideology is significantly positive: more-conservative people prefer more-restrictionist immigration policy. We note that these non-skill estimates are similar to those found by Citrin, et al (1997) and Espenshade and Hempstead (1995).14  \n\nThe actual coefficient estimates in Table 2 identify the qualitative effect on Immigration Opinion of skills and our other regressors. However, these coefficients do not answer our key substantive question of how changes in skill levels affect the probability that an individual supports immigration restrictions. To answer this question we used the estimates of Models 1 and 2 to conduct simulations calculating the effect on immigration preferences of changing skills while holding the other variables constant at their sample means.  \n\nOur simulation procedure works as follows. Recognizing that the parameters are estimated with uncertainty, we drew 1000 simulated sets of parameters from their sampling distribution defined as a multivariate normal distribution with mean equal to the maximum likelihood parameter estimates and variance equal to the variance-covariance matrix of these estimates. For each of the 1000 simulated sets of coefficients we then calculated two probabilities. Setting all variables equal to their sample means, we first calculated the estimated probability of supporting immigration restrictions, i.e., the probability of supporting a reduction in immigration by either \"a lot\" or \"a little.\" We then calculated the estimated probability of supporting immigration restrictions when our skills measure is increased to its sample maximum while holding fixed all other regressors at their means. The difference between these two estimated probabilities is the estimated difference in the probability of supporting immigration restrictions between an individual with average skills and someone with \"maximum\" skills. We calculated this difference 10o0 times, and then to show the distribution of this difference we calculated its mean, its standard error, and a $90\\%$ confidence interval around the mean.  \n\nTable 3 reports the results of this simulation for our two models. Increasing Occupational Wage from its mean to its maximum ( $\\$513$ per week to $\\$1138$ per week), holding fixed all other regressors at their means, reduces the probability of supporting immigration restrictions by 0.086 on average. This estimated change has a standard error of 0.031 and a $90\\%$ confidence interval of (-0.138, -0.036). The results for Education Years are similar. Increasing Education Years from its mean to its maximum (about 12.9 years to 17 years), holding fixed all other regressors at their means, reduces the probability of supporting immigration restrictions by 0.126 on average. This estimated change has a standard error of 0.029 and a $90\\%$ confidence interval of (-0.174, -0.081). Both cases give the same result: higher skills are strongly and significantly correlated with lower probabilities of supporting immigration restrictions. 15  \n\nCitrin, et al (1997) assume that Occupational Wage and Education Years do not measure labormarket skills. For example, Education Years might indicate tolerance or civic awareness. To test this possibility, we split our sample between those in the labor force and those not in the labor force and then restimated Models 1 and 2 on each subsample. If Occupation Wage and Education Years measure labor-market skills, then the correlation between these regressors and Immigration Opinion should hold only among labor-force participants. If these regressors measure non-labormarket considerations, then their explanatory power should not vary across the two subsamples. Table 4 reports the results. For the labor-force subsample both Occupation Wage and Education Years are strongly significant -- in fact, these coefficient estimates are larger than the full-sample estimates from Table 2. For the not-in-labor-force subsample the coefficient estimates are much smaller (in absolute value) and are not significant. We interpret these results as strong evidence that Occupation Wage and Education Years measure labor-market skills.16  \n\nThe result that skills correlate with immigration-policy preferences is inconsistent with an HO model in which immigration is completely absorbed by Rybczynski output-mix effects. It is consistent both with the factor-proportions-analysis model and with an HO model in which immigration affects both wages and output mix. By pooling all regions of the country in Tables 2 through 4, however, we have not yet tested the area-analysis model. To do this we modify our initial specifications by adding the regressor High Immigration MSA and its interaction with skills. If preferences are consistent with the area-analysis model, then less-skilled (more-skilled) workers in gateway communities should have stronger preferences for more-restrictionist (lessrestrictionist) immigration policies than less-skilled (more-skilled) workers in non-gateway communities. These preferences imply a positive coefficient on High Immigration MSA and a negative coefficient on its interaction with skills.17  \n\nTable 5 presents the results for this specification, where Model 3 uses OccupationalWage and Model 4 Education Years. The results for all the non-skill regressors are qualitatively the same as before. Our skill measures are still negatively correlated with preferences at at least the $95\\%$ level. But in neither case is High Immigration MSA significantly positive or its interaction with skills significantly negative. In fact, for Education Years we obtain the exact opposite coefficients on both regressors at about the $95\\%$ significance level. In unreported specifications we tested this specification using our other five definitions of High Immigration MSA and/or splitting the sample as in Table 4. In almost every case the interaction term's coefficient was positive but not significant; in no case did the interaction term ever have a significantly negative coefficient or High Immigration MSA a significantly positive one. Overall, people living in high-immigration areas do not have a stronger correlation between skills and immigration-policy preferences than people living elsewhere. If anything, the skills-preferences link may be attenuated in high-immigration areas. In any case, we conclude that this link is inconsistent with the area-analysis model.18  \n\n## 5.2 Robustness Checks  \n\nWe checked the robustness of the empirical results by trying other measures of our important regressors. For skills we tried three dichotomous variables of educational attainment (high-school dropouts, high-school graduates, and some college--the omitted group being college and beyond) to look for any non-linearities in how skills affect preferences.19 We discovered no clear nonlinearities: the relative coeficients on the dichotomous measures seemed consistent with an overall linear effect. For skills we also tried the respondents reported 1991 annual income, and obtained qualitatively similar results to those for Occupation Wage and Education Years.20 In addition to the six measures of High Immigration Area discussed earlier, we also tried a dichotomous measure of residence in one of the \"big six\" immigrant states of California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. Borjas, et al (1997) report that in $196060\\%$ of all U.S. immigrants lived in these six states and that by 1990 that share had risen to $75\\%$ . Borjas, et al (1996) report that in $199260\\%$ of all U.S. legal immigrants came into California or New York alone; another $20\\%$ entered the other four gateway states. With this measure we again found no evidence of preferences consistent with the area-analysis model.  \n\nWe also checked the robustness of our results by including other regressors. One was union membership: union members preferred more-restrictionist immigration policy, an effect that was statistically significant in some specifications. Two other regressors were retrospectiveevaluations of the national economy and retrospective evaluations of personal finances. Both retrospective measures tended to have the expected sign -- those with gloomier retrospections preferred morerestrictionist immigration policy -- but were always insignificant. Finally, we included state unemployment rates, another geography-varying regressor in addition to High Immigration MSA, to control in the cross-section for any business-cycle effect on immigration-policy preferences. This regressor was always insignificant, however.  \n\n# 6 Conclusion  \n\nIn this paper we have provided new evidence on the determinants of individual immigrationpolicy preferences and on what these preferences imply about how economies absorb immigrants. In particular, we documented a robust link between labor-market skills and preferences: lessskilled (more-skilled) people prefer more-restrictionist (less-restrictionist) immigration policy. This link strongly supports the contention that people's position in the labor force influences their policy opinions. It is consistent both with the factor-proportions-analysis model and with a Heckscher-Ohlin multi-cone model. We found no evidence that this skills-preferences link is  \n\nstronger in high-immigration labor markets--if anything, the link may be attenuated in these areas.   \nThis finding is inconsistent with the area-analysis model.  \n\nThese results are important for constructing empirically useful models of the political economy of immigration policymaking in receiving states. In particular, the link between skills and immigration-policy preferences suggests the potential for immigration politics to be connected to the mainstream redistributive politics over which political parties often contest elections. In addition, our findings shed further light both on how individuals form preferences over international economic policies and what these preferences imply for the domestic politics of countries with significant flows of goods, capital, and people across their borders. The skills cleavage over immigration policy reinforces our earlier finding of a strong relationship between individual skill levels and support for trade protection in the United States (Scheve and Slaughter, 1998). Taken together, these two studies suggest that skill levels play an important role in shaping political divisions in the electorate over international economic policies.  \n\n# References  \n\nAltonji, Joseph, and David Card. 1991. \"The Effects of Immigration on the Labor Market Outcomes of Less-Skilled Natives.\" In John Abowd and Richard Freeman, eds, Immigration, Trade, and the Labor Market, (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press), 201-234.   \nBartel, Ann. 1989. \"Where Do the New U.S. Immigrants Live?\" Journal of Labor Economics 7 (4): 371-391.   \nBenhabib, Jess. 1996. \"On the Political Economy of Immigration.\" European Economic Review 40:1737-1743.   \nBerman, Eli, John Bound, and Zvi Griliches. 1994. \"Changes in the Demand for Skilled Labor within U.s.

    "reference_markdown": "# Testing for Asymmetric Employer Learning  \n\nUta Schonberg, University of Rochester  \n\nRecent evidence suggests that employers acquire more precise information about a worker's productivity the more time he or she spends in the labor market. The following question arises: Is learning symmetric, that is, do all employers have the same information about workers’ productivity, or is learning asymmetric, that is, does the current employer have superior information about workers’ productivity? This article develops a learning model with endogenous mobility that nests both learning hypotheses. It then proposes new tests for asymmetric employer learning. Overall, learning appears to be mostly symmetric, except possibly when the employees involved are college graduates.  \n\n## 1. Introduction  \n\nIn a world where the productivity of labor market participants is difficult to observe, a participant's individual career path and employment history forms a significant basis for any company's hiring decisions. The longer is a job candidate's employment history, the more information a recruiting firm can draw upon in assessing the candidate's ability to do the job for which he or she is being considered. Some information about the candidate's ability, such as his or her education or other contents of the curriculum vitae, is available to all recruiting firms. Other information may be available only to the candidate's current employer. As an illus  \n\nI would like to thank Christian Dustmann, Kevin Lang, Alan Manning, and Costas Meghir for comments and suggestions.

The incumbent firm is likely to use the number of cases the lawyer wins and loses to update its belief about his or her productivity. This information may also be available to outside firms. However, the incumbent firm may be better informed about the lawyer's ability to work as a member of a team or ability to cope with stress.  \n\nDo outside and current firms receive the same information about workers’ productivity? This is termed “symmetric employer learning” in the literature. Models of this type were first analyzed by Freeman (1977) and Harris and Holmstrom (1982). Or do recruiting firms have an informational disadvantage relative to workers’ current employers? This is termed \"asymmetric employer learning” in the literature. Early examples of this type of model are Waldman (1984) and Greenwald (1986). The empirical evidence on whether learning is symmetric or asymmetric so far is inconclusive. While Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001) provide evidence in favor of symmetric learning, Gibbons and Katz (1991) argue that employer learning is asymmetric.  \n\nThis article attempts to distinguish between the two learning hypotheses. It sets up a learning model that nests both learning hypotheses, and it then proposes new tests for asymmetric employer learning. Distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric learning is important for several reasons. First, the labor market may fail to efficiently allocate workers to jobs if learning is asymmetric. For instance, in the asymmetric learning models of Waldman (1984) and Bernhardt (1995), job assignment within firms is inefficient. Second, the type of employer learning affects the structure of wages. If learning is asymmetric, incumbent firms pay wages below productivity and general productivity is rewarded as if it were firm specific. This has important consequences for educational policies. As employers earn higher rents on more able workers, frms have an incentive to pay for general training if training and ability are complements (Waldman 1990; Acemoglu and Pischke 1998). Conversely, asymmetric learning distorts the incentive for workers to pay for skill acquisition.2 Third, the type of employer learning has consequences for statistical discrimination. Easily observable signals about workers′ productivities, such as their education, will have a longer impact on wage determination under asymmetric learning than under symmetric learning.  \n\nThere is thus more scope for statistical discrimination if learning is asymmetric.'  \n\nMy testing strategy proceeds in two steps. Both steps make use of a variable that is an indicator for workers’ abilities but that is not observed by employers, such as a test score. A well-known consequence of asymmetric learning is that workers who switch firms are less able than workers who stay with their employer (e.g., Greenwald 1986; Gibbons and Katz 1991). I therefore begin by testing for an adverse selection of movers. Unlike the existing literature, I do this directly by estimating how ability measures affect the probability that a worker switches firms. My second test is a modification of Farber and Gibbons's (1996) and Altonji and Pierret's (2001) test for symmetric learning. I argue that hard- and easyto-observe variables, such as ability and education, have the same impact on wage offers of incumbent and outside firms if learning is symmetric. If, in contrast, incumbent firms are better informed about a worker's ability than are outside firms, then ability should have a stronger, and schooling a weaker, impact on wage offers of incumbent firms, as compared to those of outside firms. This is because incumbent firms use the newly acquired information about a worker's ability, while outside firms continue to use education as a signal when determining wages. I test these implications by analyzing how the impacts of the test score and schooling vary with tenure, controlling for interactions between these variables and experience.  \n\nThe empirical analysis is based on the same data set that Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001) use to test for symmetric learning, that of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79). This data set contains the complete work history of a cohort of workers from their labor market entry onward. It focuses on young workers, for whom learning and firm mobility should matter the most. I follow Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001) and use the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) as a variable that is correlated with ability but not observed by employers. The AFQT score provides a summary measure for basic literacy and numeric skills and is thus an indicator for workers’ cognitive abilities. My tests are therefore best understood as tests for employer learning about workers’ cognitive abilities, as opposed to employer learning about workers’ noncognitive abilities, such as communication skills.  \n\nMy results suggest that learning (about cognitive skills) is largely symmetric. There are, however, important differences across education groups.  \n\nFor college graduates, the empirical evidence is potentially consistent with a model of asymmetric employer learning.  \n\nThe plan of this article is as follows. Section II reviews existing tests for symmetric and asymmetric employer learning. Section II develops the learning model and contrasts the empirical implications of symmetric learning with those of asymmetric learning. Section IV describes the data, while Section V reports results. Section VI concludes and discusses alternative explanations for my findings.  \n\n## I1. Existing Tests for Employer Learning  \n\nThis section briefly describes existing tests for symmetric and asymmetric learning. Gibbons and Katz (1991) were the first to provide a test for asymmetric learning. Others, such as Doiron (1995) and Grund (1999), have used their methodology to test for asymmetric learning in other countries.  \n\nGibbons and Katz's test for asymmetric learning is based on the idea that, under asymmetric learning, the market will regard a layoff as a bad signal. No such stigma is attached to workers who are displaced from their firm for exogenous reasons, for instance, because of plant closure. This implies that laid-off workers are less able on average than exogenous movers, resulting in a lower postdisplacement wage for laid-off workers. Exogenous movers and laid-off workers look the same when they enter the labor market. Hence, asymmetric learning additionally predicts the same predisplacement wage for both groups of workers. Taken together, this implies a greater wage loss for laid-off workers than for exogenous movers. Using data from the Current Population Survey Displacement Survey, Gibbons and Katz (1991) find support for these hypotheses.4  \n\nThis article directly tests the key implication of asymmetric learning the adverse selection of movers—-by analyzing the impact of ability measures on a worker's propensity to move away from his current employer. I attempt to further improve on Gibbons and Katz (1991) by proposing an additional test for asymmetric learning based on how easy- and hardto-observe variables affect wage offers of incumbent and outside firms.  \n\nIn a recent paper, DeVaro and Waldman (2004) provide an alternative test for asymmetric employer learning that is not directly related to mine. Their starting point is that, under asymmetric employer learning, promotions act as a signal for workers’ abilities. They derive two testable predictions. First, workers with high levels of education are promoted faster. Second, the wage increase associated with a promotion decreases with education. Using data on personnel records for managerial workers in a large firm, they find empirical support for both predictions.  \n\nFarber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001) derive empirical implications of symmetric employer learning. Bauer and HaiskenDeNew (2001) and Galindo-Rueda (2003) use a similar methodology to test for employer learning in Germany and the United Kingdom, respectively. Lange (2007) extends Altonji and Pierret's (2001) framework to compute the signaling value of education. Farber and Gibbons (1996) derive their empirical predictions for wage levels, while Altonji and Pierret (2001) derive theirs for log wages. Both Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001) assume that the effect of education (an easyto-observe variable) on a worker's productivity does not vary with labor market experience. Suppose that the econometrician has access to a variable that is correlated with ability but that is not observed by employers. Altonji and Pierret (2001) and Farber and Gibbons (1996) use (inter alia) the AFQT score as such a variable. They show that the coefficient on the AFQT score should increase with experience. This is because wages become increasingly dependent on ability as employers acquire new information about a worker's ability. Farber and Gibbons (1996) also show that the impact of education on wage levels should be independent of experience if the interaction between the AFQT score and experience is not included in the wage level regression. This is because, on average, future observations simply validate the relationship between expected productivity and schooling for labor market entrants. Finally, Altonji and Pierret (2001) argue that the effect of schooling should decline with experience if the interaction between the AFQT score and experience is included in the log-wage regression.? This is because, at labor market entry, when only imprecise information about a worker's ability is available to firms, employers rely on easy-to-observe variables that are correlated with ability when determining wages. They do so less and less as they acquire more information about a worker's ability.  \n\nI argue that these implications are also consistent with asymmetric employer learning. I extend the learning model of Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001) in two ways.8 First, my model allows  \n\n5 To be precise, Farber and Gibbons (1996) show that the part of the AFQT score that is orthogonal to information available to employers at labor market entry increases with experience.  \n\n6 This prediction depends on the functional form. If, as in Altonji and Pierret (2001), they had derived their predictions in logs, the same would hold in a logwageregression.  \n\n7 If the effect of education on productivity increases with experience (i.e., if education affects not only wage levels but also wage growth), then this prediction becomes weaker. In this case, the coefficient on the interaction between schooling and experience should be smaller if the interaction between the AFQT score and experience is included in the regression.  \n\nHowever, my model is less general than the learning models of Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001) as it considers two periods only.  \n\nTable 1 Specification of Productivity   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>No College</td><td>College</td></tr><tr><td>Low ability</td><td>y²=aL</td><td>y=a+s</td></tr><tr><td>High ability</td><td>y'H Hp=</td><td>yH =aH+s</td></tr><tr><td>Proportion low ability</td><td>pN</td><td>pC</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nfor asymmetric learning and considers the symmetric learning model as a special case. Second, I introduce mobility into the model.? These extensions allow me to modify the existing tests for symmetric employer learning such that it is possible to discriminate between the two learning hypotheses. The key insight is that ability and education affect wages of incumbent and outside firms in the same manner if learning is symmetric but differently if learning is asymmetric.  \n\n## 11I. Model  \n\nThis section sets up a simple learning model that nests the symmetric and the pure asymmetric learning model as special cases.  \n\n### A. Description of Environment  \n\nThere are many workers and firms, each of which is risk neutral. Firms maximize expected profits, and workers maximize expected utility. I consider two periods. There is no discounting.  \n\n### 1. Productivity  \n\nWorkers differ with respect to ability and education. A worker's education is an easy to observe variable, one known to all employers. Ability may, in principle, comprise all of those characteristics that workers bring to the labor market that are hard to observe by employers, such as cognitive ability or communication skills. Workers are either of low $(L)$ or high $(H)$ ability, and they have attended either college $(C)$ or high school $(N)$ . I denote education by the superscript $k$ $,k=C,N,$ and ability by the subscript i, $i=L,H.$ Table 1 specifies the worker's productivity $y_{i}^{k}$  \n\nThis specification assumes that schooling increases the productivity of low-ability workers by as much as that of high-ability workers. I discuss the case in which schooling has a greater impact on the productivity of  \n\nhigh-ability workers as compared to low-ability workers in Section III.D.   \nThere is no human capital accumulation.  \n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{p}^{N}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}^{c}$ denote the proportion of low-ability workers among college graduates and high school graduates. The proportion of low-ability Workers is higher among high school graduates than among college graduates, that is, $\\boldsymbol{p}^{N}>\\boldsymbol{p}^{C}$ . Hence, education provides a useful signal for a worker's ability. There is ample empirical evidence of a positive correlation between education and ability. For instance, for Sweden, Meghir and Palme (2005) find that various measures of a child's cognitive ability subsequently increase his or her educational attainment. For the United States, Heckman and Vytlacil (2001), as well as Cawley, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2001), document a strong correlation between ability measures and schooling.  \n\n### 2. Information Structure  \n\nIn the first period, firms and workers observe a worker's education but not his or her ability; information is symmetric between firms and workers. In the second period, incumbent firms get to know the worker's ability. In contrast, outside firms observe a common noisy signal about the worker's ability. It is important to stress that the signal is public, that is, all outside firms receive the same signal about a worker. The signal can take two values, good $(G)$ or bad $(B)$ . I denote the signal by the superscript s, $s=G,B$ . The signal is symmetric, that is, the probability that a low-ability worker generates a bad signal is the same as the probability that a high-ability worker generates a good signal. Moreover, the signal is independent of the worker's education. Let $q$ denote the probability that the firm observes the correct signal, $q\\geq0.5$ . Outside firms use the signal, as well as education, to update their beliefs about the worker's productivity. They compute the probability that a worker is of low ability, conditional on education $k$ and on a good or bad signal, using Bayes's law:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\boldsymbol{p}^{k,B}=\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\boldsymbol{L}|k,B)=\\cfrac{\\boldsymbol{p}^{k}\\boldsymbol{q}}{\\boldsymbol{p}^{k}\\boldsymbol{q}+(1-\\boldsymbol{p}^{k})(1-\\boldsymbol{q})},k=C,N,}\\ &{\\boldsymbol{p}^{k,G}=\\operatorname*{Pr}(\\boldsymbol{L}|k,G)=\\cfrac{\\boldsymbol{p}^{k}(1-\\boldsymbol{q})}{\\boldsymbol{p}^{k}(1-\\boldsymbol{q})+(1-\\boldsymbol{p}^{k})\\boldsymbol{q}},k=C,N.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis specification nests the symmetric and pure asymmetric learning models as special cases. Suppose that $q=1.$ In this case, all low-ability workers generate a bad signal and all high-ability workers generate a good signal. Hence, $\\operatorname*{Pr}(L|k,B)=1$ , and $\\mathrm{Pr}\\left(L|k,G\\right)=0$ Outside firms therefore have the same information about a worker's ability as incumbent firms, and learning is symmetric. Next, suppose that $q=0.5$ . In this case, low-ability and high-ability workers generate a good or bad signal with equal probability. In other words, the signal contains no useful information that helps outside firms to predict a worker's ability. Hence, $\\mathrm{Pr}(L|k,B)=$ $\\operatorname*{Pr}(L|k,G)=p^{k}$ , and learning is purely asymmetric. In all intermediate cases $(0.5<q<1)$ 0, outside firms receive new information about a worker's ability. Incumbent firms, however, are better informed about a worker's ability. I refer to the case $q=1$ as “symmetric learning” and to the case $q<1$ as “asymmetric learning.  \n\n### 3. Mobility  \n\nAs in Acemoglu and Pischke (1998), workers experience a utility shock $\\theta$ at the end of the frst period. This shock captures a worker's ex-post evaluation of his or her work environment and may reflect distance to work, personal relationships with coworkers and superiors, health care programs, and so forth. Only the worker—not the firm—observes $\\theta$ Alternatively, $\\theta$ may be interpreted as a cost of moving. The utility shock is drawn from a distribution with the cumulative distribution function $G$ with associated probability distribution function $g$ and support $[\\underline{{\\theta}},\\overline{{\\theta}}],$ $\\overline{{\\theta}}>0$ I assume that $G(.)$ belongs to the family of log-concave distribution functions, that is, that $g(\\theta)/(1-G(\\theta))$ is nondecreasing in $\\theta.$ The distribution of the utility shock is independent of a worker's ability and his or her education.  \n\nI specify the worker's utility in period 2 at incumbent firms, $U,$ asa linear function of the incumbent firm's wage offer, $\\boldsymbol{\\varpi}$ , and the utility from nonpecuniary job characteristics, $\\theta$  \n\n$$\nU=w+\\theta.\n$$  \n\nThe worker's utility at outside frms is equal to the outside firm's wage offer, $\\boldsymbol{v}$  \n\n### 4. Wage Determination  \n\nWages are determined in spot markets. This is in line with my assumption that workers are risk neutral. Consequently, workers do not benefit from long-term contracts that insure them against low realizations of their ability, as analyzed in Harris and Holmstrom (1982). In the first period, frms simultaneously make wage offers to workers. In the second period, outside frms simultaneously make wage offers to workers. An incumbent firm observes a worker's (best) outside wage offer and then makes a counteroffer. This wage determination process has been adopted in most of the literature on asymmetric employer learning (e.g., Waldman  \n\n1984; Greenwald 1986; Gibbons and Katz 1991).10 Finally, I impose a free entry condition: no firm earns positive (expected) profits in the long run.  \n\n### 5. Free Entry  \n\nTo summarize, the timing of events is as follows. At the beginning of period 1, firms simultaneously make wage offers to workers. Firms observe a worker's education but not his or her ability. Information is symmetric between firms and workers. Each worker chooses the highest wage offer. Then production takes place. Incumbent firms observe the worker's ability, while outside firms receive a common noisy signal. At the beginning of period 2, outside firms simultaneously make wage offers to workers. Incumbent firms observe a worker's (best) outside offer and make a counteroffer. Workers then discover their utility shocks and decide whether or not to stay with their initial employers. At the end of the second period, workers retire.  \n\nSection IHI.B analyzes the model. Section IHI.C contrasts the empirical implications of symmetric learning with those of asymmetric learning, and Section III.D. presents some alternative assumptions. Section III.E describes how I take these implications to the data.  \n\n### B. Analysis  \n\n#### 1. Wage Determination in the Second Period  \n\nI begin with wage determination in the second period. In the second period, outside frms do not directly observe a worker's ability but obtain only a noisy signal. They use the signal in conjunction with a worker's education to update their belief about the worker's ability. Consequently, wage offers of outside frms depend on education as well as the signal. I therefore index wage offers of outside firms by the superscripts $k$ (education) and s (signal). Incumbent firms, in contrast, directly observe a worker's ability. Since incumbent firms observe the wage offers from outside frms and outside frms offer a higher wage if a good signal is observed, wage offers of incumbent firms depend not only on education and ability but also on signals. I therefore index wage offers of incumbent firms by the subscript $i$ (ability) and the superscripts $k$ (education) and $s$ (signal).  \n\nIncumbent firms.—First, consider incumbent firms. Incumbent firms face the trade-off between a higher chance of keeping a worker and a lower profit per worker. Suppose that the best wage offer a worker with education $\\bar{k}$ and ability $i$ has received from an outside firm is $\\boldsymbol{v}^{k,s}$ .Theworker stays with his or her employer if the wage offer of the incumbent firm, $\\boldsymbol{w}_{i}^{k,s}$ plus the utility shock, $\\theta$ , exceeds his or her best outside wage offer:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\operatorname*{Pr}{(\\operatorname{stay}|i,~k,~s)}=\\operatorname*{Pr}{(w_{i}^{k,s}+\\theta>v^{k,s})}}\\ &{\\qquad=1-G(v^{k,s}-w^{k,s}),}\\ &{\\qquadi=L,~H;~k=C,~N;~s=B,~G.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIncumbent firms maximize as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\operatorname*{max}_{\\omega_{i}^{k},[1}-G(v^{k,s}-\\varpi_{i}^{k,s})](y_{i}^{k}-\\varpi_{i}^{k,s}),}\\ &{\\qquadi=L,H;k=C,N;s=B,G.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe first-order condition may be written as  \n\n$$\nw_{i}^{k,s}=y_{i}^{k}-\\frac{1-G(v^{k,s}-w_{i}^{k,s})}{g(v^{k,s}-w_{i}^{k,s})}.\n$$  \n\nOutside firms.—Next, consider outside firms. Due to perfect competition in the outside market, outside wages are bid up to the expected productivity of those workers who switch firms. Since, conditional on the signal, low-ability workers receive the same wage offer as high-ability workers but a lower wage offer from incumbent firms, they are more likely to switch firms than are high-ability workers. Outside firms must account for this adverse selection of movers when deciding which wage to offer. Let $\\boldsymbol{p}^{k,s}$ denote the probability that a worker with education $k$ and signal $s$ is of low ability. (See eqq. [1] and [2] in Sec. I1.A for how $\\boldsymbol{p}^{k,s}$ is computed.) Outside wages equal  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{v^{k,s}=\\frac{\\operatorname*{Pr}{(L|\\mathrm{move},s)y_{L}^{k}}+\\operatorname*{Pr}{(H|\\mathrm{move},s)y_{H}^{k}}}{\\operatorname*{Pr}{(L|\\mathrm{move},s)}+\\operatorname*{Pr}{(H|\\mathrm{move},s)}}}\\ &{=\\frac{\\dot{p}^{k,s}G(v^{k,s}-w_{L}^{k,s})y_{L}^{k}+(1-\\dot{p}^{k,s})G(v^{k,s}-w_{H}^{k,s})y_{H}^{k}}{\\dot{p}^{k,s}G(v^{k,s}-w_{L}^{k,s})+(1-\\dot{p}^{k,s})G(v^{k,s}-w_{H}^{k,s})}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn Appendix A, Section 1, I show that an equilibrium exists, that it is unique, and that first-order conditions are sufficient for a maximum.  \n\n#### 2. Wage Determination in the First Period  \n\nI analyze wage determination in the first period in more detail in Appendix A, Section 2. At this point, it is important to bear in mind that, in the first period, firms observe a worker's education but not his or her ability. Since education is the only signal that firms have about a worker's productivity, wages in the first period depend on education but not on ability.  \n\n### C. Symmetric versus Asymmetric Learning  \n\nThis section contrasts the empirical implications of the symmetric learning model (i.e., $q=1;$ with those of the asymmetric learning model (i.e., $q<1.$ ). I first analyze how ability affects the probability of staying and moving under each learning hypothesis (Sec. IHI.C.1). I then modify Farber and Gibbons's (1996) and Altonji and Pierret's (2001) implications of symmetric learning in order to distinguish between the two learning hypotheses (Sec. IHl.C.2). All formal proofs can be found in Appendix A, Sections 3-5.  \n\n#### 1. Ability and the Probability of Switching Firms  \n\nFirst consider the case in which incumbent and outside firms have the same information about a worker's productivity (i.e., $q=1$ ). In this case, a worker is of low ability if a bad signal is observed and is of high ability if a good signal is observed (i.e.) $\\boldsymbol{p}^{k,B}=1$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}^{k,G}=0,$ . Hence, outside firms offer wages equal to $y_{L}^{k}~(y_{H}^{k})$ if they observe a bad (good) signal. It is easy to verify that, in this case, an incumbent wage offer is equal to the worker's productivity minus a positive constant $\\Delta$  \n\n$$\nw_{i}^{k}=y_{i}^{k}-\\Delta.\n$$  \n\nConsequently, $v_{L}^{k}-w_{L}^{k}=v_{H}^{k}-w_{H}^{k}$ . and  therefore $\\mathrm{Pr}(\\mathrm{move}|L,~k)=$ $\\operatorname*{Pr}({\\mathrm{move}}|H,k)$ , and low- and high-ability workers have the same probability of leaving the firm (see App. A, Sec. 3, for details).  \n\nContrast this with the case in which there are informational asymmetries between incumbent and outside firms (i.e., $q<1\\AA.$ ). Conditional on a good or a bad signal, high-ability workers receive the same wage offer as low-ability workers from outside firms, but they receive a higher wage offer from incumbent firms. Hence, conditional on the signal, low-ability workers are more likely to leave the firm than are high-ability workers.i1 In Appendix A, Section 3, I show that this also holds unconditionally, integrating over the signal realization.  \n\n#### 2. The Impact of Ability and Schooling on Wage Offers of Incumbent and Outside Firms  \n\nNext, I argue that Farber and Gibbons's (1996) and Altonji and Pierret's (2001) implications of symmetric learning are also consistent with asymmetric employer learning. I show how the implications can be modified such that it is possible to distinguish symmetric from asymmetric learning. I begin with the impact of ability on wage offers of incumbent and outside firms. I then turn to the impact of education on wage offers.  \n\nOf course, this result is welknown in the literature (e.g, Greenwald 1986;   \nGibbons and Katz 1991).  \n\nThe effect of ability on incumbent and outside wage offers.—Suppose that learning is symmetric, that is, that $q=1$ . Under this assumption, Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001) show that wages become increasingly sensitive to ability. Clearly, this is also the case in this model: wage offers in the first period do not vary with ability since firms do not observe it. In the second period, firms learn about a worker's ability and offer different wages to low-ability and high-ability workers. Thus, the impact of ability on wages is stronger in the second period than in the first. Note that this reasoning also holds even if learning is purely asymmetric because wage offers of incumbent firms depend on ability.  \n\nMy key insight is that the two learning hypotheses differ with respect to how ability affects the wage offers of incumbent and outside firms. First, consider the case in which incumbent and outside firms have the same information about a worker's ability $(q=1)$ . As shown earlier, this implies that outside firms offer wages equal to a worker's productivity while incumbent firms offer wages equal to a worker's productivity minus a constant. Consequently, $w_{H}^{k}-w_{L}^{k}=v_{H}^{k}-v_{L}^{k}$ , and ability has the same effect on wage offers of incumbent firms as on those of outside firms.  \n\nContrast this with the case in which incumbent firms are better informed about workers? abilities $(q<1)$ . Here, as shown earlier, conditional on the signal, wage offers of incumbent firms vary with ability, while wage offers of incumbent firms do not. In Appendix A, Section 4, I show that unconditionally (integrating over the signal realization) wage offers of incumbent firms continue to vary more with ability than wage offers of outside firms.  \n\nThe effect of education on the wage offers of incumbent and outside firms.—Next, I analyze how education affects the wage offers of incumbent and outside firms. Suppose that learning is symmetric $(q=1)$ . In this case (and under the assumption that the impact of education on productivity is independent of experience), Altonji and Pierret (2001) show that the impact of education declines with experience if interactions between ability measures and experience are included in the wage regression. The reason is that firms rely less and less on easily observable signals like education when determining wages as they learn more about workers’ abilities. The same intuition holds in my model. However, a declining effect of education with experience is also consistent with asymmetric learning.  \n\nAgain, the two learning hypotheses differ with respect to how schooling affects wage offers of incumbent and outside firms. First, consider the case of symmetric learning. Recall that in this case, wage offers of outside firms are equal to workers? productivity, while wage offers of incumbent firms are equal to workers' productivity minus a constant. Consequently, conditional on ability, the difference between wage offers of incumbent and outside firms to college graduates and high school graduates is $y_{i}^{C}-$ $y_{i}^{N}=s$ and schooling has the same impact on wage offers of incumbent and outside firms.  \n\nNext, suppose that incumbent firms observe a worker's ability but that outside firms are only imperfectly informed about workers? ability $(q<$ 1). In this case, outside firms continue to use a worker's education as a signal of ability. Wage offers of outside firms to college graduates therefore reflect not only the productivity-enhancing effect of education, s, but also the fact that college graduates are more able on average than high school graduates. Hence, schooling has a stronger impact on wage offers of outside firms than on those of incumbent firms. See Appendix A, Section 5, for a formal proof.  \n\nTo sum up, under symmetric learning, low-ability and high-ability workers are equally likely to switch firms and the impact of ability and education on wage offers of incumbent firms is the same as on those of outside firms. If, in contrast, there are informational asymmetries between incumbent and outside firms, then low-ability workers are more likely to leave the firm than are high-ability workers and wage offers of incumbent firms are more sensitive to ability and less sensitive to education than wage offers of outside firms.  \n\nThe next section first analyzes how these predictions change when ability and education are complements. I then briefly discuss the case in which firms receive private signals and incumbent firms learn only imperfectly about a worker's ability.  \n\n### D. Alternative Assumptions  \n\n#### 1. Complementarity between Ability and Education  \n\nSo far I have assumed that schooling raises the productivity of lowability workers the same as that of high-ability workers. This section discusses the case in which schooling raises the productivity of high-ability workers more than that of low-ability workers. All formal proofs can be found in Appendix A, Section 6.  \n\nMost important, such a complementarity between schooling and ability produces two additional implications if learning is asymmetric. First, the adverse selection of firm-switchers should be greater for college graduates than for high school graduates as schooling magnifies the impact of ability differences on output. For the same reason, the difference between the impact of ability on wage offers of incumbent and outside firms should be larger for college graduates than for high school graduates.  \n\nIn addition, the complementarity between ability and education weakens the prediction that, under asymmetric learning, wage offers of outside frms vary more with education than wage offers of incumbent firms. This prediction still holds for low-ability workers. However, it may no longer hold for high-ability workers. This is because, for high-ability workers, there are two effects that work in opposite directions. On the one hand, wage offers of outside firms vary more with education than wage offers of incumbent firms because outside firms continue to use education as a signal while incumbent firms do not. On the other hand, education increases wage offers made by incumbent firms to high-ability workers more than it increases wage offers made by outside firms to such workers because, in contrast to outside firms, incumbent firms know for sure whether a worker is of high ability.  \n\n#### 2. Private Signals and Imperfect Learning  \n\nSo far I have assumed that outside firms receive public signals and that incumbent firms get to know fully a worker's ability. This section discusses the case in which signals are private and incumbent firms imperfectly learn about a worker's ability.2 For simplicity, suppose that, in each period, there are only two frms competing for workers. Further suppose that, in each period, both firms receive a private signal about a worker's ability and that this information is symmetric in the sense that the precision of the signal is the same for both the incumbent firm and the outside frm. It is still the case that the incumbent firm will be better informed about a worker's ability than will be the outside frm. This is because the incumbent firm observes the worker's outside offer, which conveys information on the signal of the outside firm. This model leads to the same empirical implications as my asymmetric learning model. I view this model as being an alternative model of asymmetric information, one in which informational asymmetry is due not to the incumbent firm receiving more precise signals but instead to the counteroffer structure of the wage determination process. My tests of symmetric learning are therefore best understood as tests for whether or not incumbent firms are better informed in equilibrium than outside firms and not for whether incumbent frms receive more precise signals than outside firms.  \n\n### E. Empirical Implementation  \n\nThis section describes how I take the predictions of symmetric and asymmetric employer learning to the data. My tests make use of a variable that is correlated with ability but that is not observed by employers. Following Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001), I use the AFQT for this purpose.13  \n\n1Pinkston (2005)develops a learning model with private signals and derives testable implications.  \n\nA key implication of asymmetric employer learning is that low-ability workers are more likely to leave the frm than are high-ability workers. I test this implication directly by estimating the effect of the AFQT score on the worker's probability of leaving the firm, using a probit model.14 If ability and education are complements, asymmetric learning further implies a stronger adverse selection for better-educated workers. In some specifications, I therefore allow the impact of the AFQT score to vary with education.  \n\nMy second set of tests refers to how ability and education affect the wage offers of incumbent and outside firms. To test these predictions, I extend the main wage regression estimated by Altonji and Pierret (2001) asfollows:  \n\n$$\n\\ln w_{i t}=\\beta_{\\circ}+\\beta_{1}E_{i t}+\\beta_{2}T_{i t}+\\beta_{3}\\mathrm{AFQT}_{i}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{+(\\beta_{4}E_{i t}\\times\\mathrm{AFQT}_{i})+(\\beta_{5}T_{i t}\\times\\mathrm{AFQT}_{i})+\\beta_{6}S_{i}}\\ &{+(\\beta_{7}E_{i t}\\times S_{i})+(\\beta_{8}T_{i t}\\times S_{i})+\\beta_{9}X_{i t}+u_{i t},}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $E_{i t}$ denotes (actual) experience, $T_{i t}$ denotes tenure, $S_{i}$ denotes schooling, and $X_{i t}$ is a vector of (possibly time-varying) worker characteristics. The main coefficients of interest are $\\beta_{5}$ , the coefficient on the interaction between tenure and the AFQT score, and $\\beta_{8}$ . the coeffcient on the interaction between tenure and schooling. Suppose that the data are generated exactly as my stylized two-period model predicts. Then $\\beta_{5}$ and $\\beta_{8}$ identify the difference between the impact of ability and schooling on wage offers of incumbent and outside firms, conditional on accepting the incumbent or outside firm's wage offer. If learning is symmetric $(q=1)$ ， then ability and education have the same impact on wage offers of incumbent and outside firms. Hence, $\\beta_{5}$ and $\\beta_{8}$ should be equal to zero. If, in contrast, learning is asymmetric $(q<1)$ , then wage offers of incumbent firms vary more with ability and less with education than wage offers of outside firms. However, accepted wages may differ from offered wages because the type of signal a worker receives may affect the probability that he stays with the firm.15 Unfortunately, I was not able to show an  \n\n1# A probit model is suggested by my modelif nonpecuniary job charactersitics are drawn from a normal distribution.  \n\n15 For example, low-ability workers are, on average, offered a wage $q w_{L}^{k,B}+$ $(1-q)w_{L}^{k,G}$ from incumbent frms and $q v^{k,B}+(1-q)v^{k,G}$ from outside frms.Accepted wages from incumbent and outside firms, in contrast, equal  \n\n$$\n\\frac{q[1-G(v^{k,B}-{w}_{L}^{k,B})]{w}_{L}^{k,B}+(1-q)[1-G(v^{k,G}-{w}_{L}^{k,G})]{w}_{L}^{k,G}}{q[1-G(v^{k,B}-{w}_{L}^{k,B})]+(1-q)[1-G(v^{k,G}-{w}_{L}^{k,G})]},\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\frac{q G(v^{k,B}-w_{L}^{k,B})v^{k,B}+(1-q)G(v^{k,G}-w_{L}^{k,G})v^{k,G}}{q G(v^{k,B}-w_{L}^{k,B})+(1-q)G(v^{k,G}-w_{L}^{k,G})}.\n$$  \n\nalytically that accepted wages of incumbent firms are more sensitive to ability and less sensitive to education than are accepted wages of outside firms. I have computed equilibrium wages under the assumption that nonpecuniary job characteristics are drawn from a logistic or a normal distribution. I could not find any parameter values for which wage offers of incumbent firms did not vary more with ability and less with education than wage offers of outside firms, conditional on acceptance. This suggests that the implications hold not only for offered wages but also for accepted wages.  \n\nTo summarize, I test two one-sided hypotheses: first, $\\beta_{5}=0$ against $\\beta_{5}>0$ and second, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{s}}=0$ against $\\beta_{\\mathrm{s}}<0$ . The null hypothesis implies that learning is symmetric, while the alternative hypothesis implies that learning is asymmetric. Note that the alternative hypothesis merely implies that incumbent firms have superior information about a worker's ability; it does not imply that outside firms receive no new information.16  \n\nAn implicit assumption behind regression (5) is that schooling increases the productivity of low-ability workers as much as that of high-ability workers. In a final step of the empirical analysis, I augment regression (5) to allow for a possible complementarity between education and ability. Of course, labor market careers last more than two periods. By estimating regression (5) on multiperiod data, I am essentially stepping outside of my model. Unfortunately, extending the set-up to multiperiods is very difficult. For instance, workers may choose to stay with the employer even if the outside offer provides a higher current utility in order to signal that they are of high ability. Firms have to take into account such strategic behavior of workers when deciding which wages to offer. While a more dynamic version would clearly be desirable, it is beyond the scope of this article.  \n\n## IV. Data Description and Variables  \n\nThe data come from the NLSY79 and encompass the years 1979-2001. This data set is well suited to my purpose. First, it contains the complete work history, including all job-to-job and job-to-unemployment transitions, of a cohort of workers from their labor market entry onward. It thus focuses on young workers for whom learning and worker mobility should matter the most. Second, for each respondent, it contains a test score variable that is unlikely to be observed by employers, which is crucial for testing for asymmetric employer learning.  \n\nBecause I do not want to deal with a woman's fertility decision, I focus on men only. Moreover, I restrict the analysis to white men, doing so for two reasons: first, models of statistical discrimination—-in particular, models in which employers are better informed about whites than about blacks—imply that the learning process is different for blacks and whites; second, Hu and Taber (2005) repeat the empirical analysis of Gibbons and Katz (1991) and provide evidence in favor of asymmetric employer learning only for white men and not for black men.17 Estimating the same model for blacks and whites may thus be misleading.  \n\nFor each respondent, I construct the labor market history from the NLSY79 Work-History file, which contains week-by-week longitudinal work records. From this file, I select the respondent's labor force status and job number at the beginning of each quarter (i.e., I select the first week in 1978, the fourteenth week in 1978, .. . the first week in 1979, the fourteenth week in 1979, etc.). For multiple job holders, I define the main job as the job at which the worker worked the most during the week. I consider only the main job for each respondent and ignore additional jobs. I match to this data set the educational histories of each respondent, that is, his enrollment status as well as his highest grade completed.  \n\nA major problem in the NLSY79 concerns the type of employment relations one should consider in the analysis. I consider only jobs held after the respondent has entered the labor market. Labor market entry is difficult to define because working while enrolled at school is very common. See Appendix B, Section 3 for the precise definition.  \n\nMy sample is then created as follows. There are 2,439 white men in the cross-sectional sample of the NLSY79. Out of those, 95 have never made a transition from school to work according to my definition. I drop individuals who entered the labor market before 1978, since detailed information about weeks worked and employers worked for is only available starting January 1978. I lose 659 individuals because of this. This leaves me with 1,685 individuals.  \n\nAs did Farber and Gibbons (1996) and Altonji and Pierret (2001), I use the AFQT as a variable that is correlated with ability but that is not observed by employers. The AFQT provides a summary measure of basic literacy and numeric skills. It is generally seen as a good indicator of workers’ cognitive abilities but as probably not as good an indicator of workers’ communication skills. My tests are therefore best understood as tests for the employer learning about workers? cognitive abilities. In my sample, the AFQT score is missing for 76 individuals. For a further 20 individuals, the test conditions were altered. I drop these individuals. This leaves me with 1,589 individuals. Since respondents were of different ages when they took the AFQT, I adjust the test score for the respondent's age at the test. Following the literature, I standardize the AFQT score to have a zero mean and a standard deviation of one.  \n\nMy first test for symmetric versus asymmetric learning is based on how ability affects the probability of leaving the frm. I test this using quarterly data, where the dependent variable is equal to one if the worker leaves the firm during the quarter and zero otherwise. Note that the quarterly quit rate is not defined for workers who were not employed at the beginning of the quarter. I require a mover to have left his job permanently. Workers who have been laid off and who return to their previous firm are considered as stayers. I do this because the employing firm has essentially the same information about these workers’ productivities as do other incumbent firms, and this information is potentially superior to the information of other outside firms. I drop observations if the worker did not work for pay, was employed in the agricultural sector, or was employed part time $(<30$ hours) at the beginning of the quarter. Finally, I drop spells with missing information on highest grade completed or industry and occupation affiliation. I lose one individual because of these restrictions. My final sample consists of 1,588 individuals and 87,121 quarterly observations.  \n\nMy second test for symmetric versus asymmetric learning is based on how the impact of the AFQT score and education changes with tenure. In order to test these implications, I transform the quarterly data set into a spell data set, and I keep one observation per job and interview year. I do this because wage data are not available for each quarter. I drop observations with hourly wage rates smaller than $\\$1$ or greater than $\\$500$ My final sample consists of 1,584 individuals and 22,093 observations. Details on how the spell data set was constructed can be found in Appendix B, Section 2.  \n\nAfter experimenting with several definitions, I decided to distinguish between two education groups. I label these two groups “high school graduates\" and “college graduates.\" High school graduates are workers without bachelor's degree. They include high school dropouts as well as workers with some college education. College graduates are workers who completed (at least) a bachelor's degree. Results for high school dropouts and high school graduates with and without some college education are similar, so I decided not to distinguish between these three groups. Table 2 reports the means and standard deviations for both the quarterly and the spell data of the most important variables used for the analysis.  \n\n## V. Empirical Evidence  \n\nMy testing strategy proceeds in two steps. First, I analyze how the AFQT score affects the probability of switching firms (Sec. V.A). Second, I test whether easy- and hard-to-observe variables have the same or dif  \n\nTable2 Means and Standard Deviations of Selected Variables   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>High School Graduates</td><td>College Graduates</td></tr><tr><td>Quarterly data:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No. individuals</td><td>1,032</td><td>556</td></tr><tr><td>No. observations</td><td>57,637</td><td>29,452</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted AFQT score</td><td>-.097</td><td>1.103</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(.874)</td><td>(.610)</td></tr><tr><td>Proportion moving (%)</td><td>9.15</td><td>6.24 6.840</td></tr><tr><td>Actual experience</td><td>7.364 (4.997)</td><td>(4.643)</td></tr><tr><td>Tenure</td><td>3.504</td><td>3.743</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.817)</td><td>(3.698)</td></tr><tr><td>No. jobs</td><td>5.579</td><td>4.230</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.820 )</td><td>(2.965 )</td></tr><tr><td>Spell data:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No. individuals</td><td>1,032</td><td>552</td></tr><tr><td>No. observations</td><td>15,205</td><td>6,888</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted AFQT score</td><td>-.120</td><td>1.097</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(.871)</td><td>(.609)</td></tr><tr><td>Experience</td><td>7.547</td><td>7.296</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(5.004)</td><td>(4.749)</td></tr><tr><td>Tenure</td><td>2.957</td><td>3.376</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.359)</td><td>(3.366)</td></tr><tr><td>No. jobs</td><td>4.806</td><td>3.592</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3.789)</td><td>(2.737)</td></tr><tr><td>Real hourly wage rate (in cents)</td><td>744.13</td><td>1,170.80</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(619.65)</td><td>(982.87)</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nNoTE.-Quarterly data are used to test how the AFQT score affect the probability of switching firms.

V.B).   \nI discuss potential alternative explanations for my findings in Section VI.  \n\n### A. Are Movers Negatively Selected?  \n\nIf there are informational asymmetries between incumbent and outside firms, then low-ability workers are more likely to leave the firm than are high-ability workers. Symmetric learning, in contrast, predicts no such adverse selection. I test this prediction by estimating probit models with the quarterly quit rate as the dependent variable. The key (one-sided) hypothesis test is whether the coefficient on the AFQT score is zero (symmetric learning) or negative (asymmetric learning).  \n\nPanel A of table 3 presents the results. Row A restricts the impact of the AFQT score to be the same for college graduates and high school graduates, while row B allows the effect to be different. In addition to the variables reported in the table, column 1 controls for years of schooling, year effects, experience, tenure, and whether the interview took place during the quarter;18 column 2 additionally includes industry and occupation dummies. I control for industry and occupation affliation for the following reason. Suppose that some industries and occupations offer more stable jobs than others and that more able workers sort into more stable industries and occupations.19 Unconditional on industry and occupation, such a sorting model provides an alternative explanation for a negative correlation between ability and mobility.  \n\nTable3 The Impact of the AFQT Score on the Probability of Moving   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\"></td><td colspan=\"2\">Panel A: Probability of Moving</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>A.AFQT</td><td>-.004**</td><td>-.002 (.001)</td></tr><tr><td>1.H。: industrial and occupation</td><td>(.002)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>dummies = 0 B.AFQT</td><td>-.003</td><td>.000 -.001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(.002)</td><td>(.002)</td></tr><tr><td>AFQT x college</td><td>-.004</td><td>-.004</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(.003)</td><td>(.003)</td></tr><tr><td>2.

Probit models, marginal effects, are reported. The dependent variable in panel B is equal to zero if the worker stays, one if he moves from job-to-job (jti), and two if he moves from job-to-unemployment (jtu).Multinominal logit models, stayers, are the base category.White/Huber standard errors clustered at the individual level are in parentheses. In addition to the variables reported, col. 1 controls for college graduation, year dummies, experience, tenure, highest grade completed, and a dummy variable if the interview took place during the quarter, while col. 2 additionally includes 12 industry and seven occupation dummies. RowA restricts the effect of the AFQT score to be the same forhigh schoolgraduates and college graduates. Row B allows the effect of the AFQT score to vary by college graduation. The $\\boldsymbol{p}$ -values refer to a two-sided hypothesis test. $p<.05$ $p<.01$  \n\nFirst, consider the results in row A, column 1 of table 3. According to this specification, an increase in the AFQT score by one standard deviation reduces the quarterly moving rate by 0.38 percentage points. The overall quarterly quit rate is $8.16\\%$ ; hence, an increase in the AFQT score by one standard deviation lowers the quarterly quit rate by about $4.6\\%$ .The effect is statistically significant. For this specification, I therefore reject the null hypothesis of symmetric learning in favor of the alternative hypothesis of asymmetric learning. If, however, I also control for industry and occupation affiliation (col. 2), the coefficient on the AFQT score becomes smaller in magnitude and is no longer statistically significant. This indicates that sorting by ability into occupations and industries is important, and it casts some doubt on the hypothesis that the adverse selection of movers in row A is due to asymmetric information.  \n\nResults in row A of panel A of table 3 restrict the effect of the AFQT score to be the same for high school graduates and college graduates. However, my model predicts a stronger adverse selection for college graduates if learning is asymmetric and education and ability are complements. Row B of table 3 therefore allows the effect of the AFQT score to be different for college graduates and high school graduates. The adverse selection is indeed stronger for college graduates. According to specification 2, an increase in the AFQT score by one standard deviation lowers the quarterly quit rate for high school graduates by 0.1 percentage points, or about $1\\%$ of the baseline.2o For college graduates, in contrast, the decrease is $0.5((0.001+0.004)\\times100)$ percentage points, or $8\\%$ of the baseline.?1 For this specification, I therefore reject the hypothesis of symmetric employer learning in favor of the alternative hypothesis of asymmetric learning for college graduates ( $\\boldsymbol{\\ p}$ -value $=$ .028) but not for high school graduates $(p\\mathrm{-value}=.307).$ 2  \n\nOf course, there are explanations other than asymmetric information for an adverse selection of movers. For instance, consider an extension of my model that incorporates unemployment, and suppose that low-ability and high-ability workers receive the same utility from unemployment. Such a model predicts that low-ability workers are more likely to become unemployed even if learning is symmetric. However, low-ability workers should not be more likely to move from job to job. Under asymmetric learning, in contrast, job-to-job movers should be of lower ability, too. In panel B of table 3, I therefore distinguish between job-to-job and job-tounemployment transitions and estimate a multinominal logit model, using stayers as the base category. A distinction between job-to-job and job-tounemployment movers turns out to be important. When restricting the impact of the AFQT score to be the same for high school graduates and college graduates (row A, cols. 1 and 2), the AFQT score lowers the probability of becoming unemployed but not the probability of moving from job to job, relative to the probability of staying. This casts further doubt that the lower ability of movers found in panel A, column 1, is driven by informational asymmetries between incumbent and outside firms.  \n\nAgain, there are interesting differences between education groups, and the hypothesis that there are no differences between high school graduates and college graduates can be rejected at a $5\\%$ level. For high school graduates, the AFQT score decreases the probability of becoming unemployed but not the probability of moving from job to job relative to the probability of staying. For college graduates, in contrast, the AFQT score also reduces the (relative) probability of moving from job to job. This strengthens my previous finding that the hypothesis of symmetric employer learning can be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis of asymmetric learning for college graduates but not for high school graduates.  \n\n### B. Learning by Experience or Tenure?  \n\nI now turn to my second test for asymmetric learning and analyze how in a wage regression the coefficients on the AFQT score and schooling vary with experience and tenure. Table 4 reports the results. All specifications control for occupation and industry affliation, years of schooling, experience, experience squared, time dummies, and time dummies interacted with years of schooling, in addition to the variables reported in the table.23 The first two columns replicate Altonji and Pierret's analysis using my longer sample that includes data until 2001.24 Column 1 includes the AFQT score and years of schooling interacted with experience, while column 2 additionally controls for the AFQT score interacted with experience. I confirm Altonji and Pierret's finding that the impact of the AFQT score on wages increases and the impact of schooling declines with experience.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">8 Quadratic Specification 7</td><td>(.002) -.005 -.014 .005 (.019) -.001'</td><td>(.011) \".001” (.002) (600) .008 (.018)</td><td>.005 (.015) 600 (.011) .072* (.037) -.019 (.020) .049** -.002 (.013) (.010) .095** (.032) -.032 (.018)</td></tr><tr><td>-.014 (.020) -.005 6 .010 (.017) 5</td><td>(.010) -.014 (600)</td><td>200' (.012) .051** (.010)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>-.023* (.012) 200'</td><td>(.011) .023* (.010)</td><td>.040** (.016)</td></tr><tr><td>Linear Specification 3</td><td>-.013 (.010)</td><td>.049** .005 (600)</td><td>(.010)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>-.023* (.011)</td><td>.023* (.010)</td><td>.039** (.012)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>-.014 (.010) 100</td><td>.052** (.010)</td><td>100 ×</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>100</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(experience) x1 × Schooling</td><td>(tenure)² × 100 × tenure</td><td>AFQT x experience ×</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nprepueis  \n\nIn order to distinguish between symmetric and asymmetric employer learning, columns 3 and 4 of table 4 additionally include tenure and tenure squared, as well as interactions between tenure, the AFQT score, and schooling. If learning is symmetric, then the coefficients on the tenureschooling and tenure-AFQT score interaction should be zero. Asymmetric employer learning, in contrast, predicts a positive coefficient on the tenure-AFQT score interaction and a negative coefficient on the tenureschooling interaction. Both coefficients are small in magnitude and statistically insignificant. Moreover, their inclusion has little effect on the coefficients on the interactions between experience and the AFQT score and schooling. Hence, for this specification, the hypothesis that employer learning is symmetric cannot be rejected. This is in line with my previous finding that there is little evidence for an adverse selection of movers if I do not distinguish between education groups.  \n\nSo far, the specification has assumed that the effect of the AFQT score and schooling varies linearly with experience and tenure. However, if firms learn more about inexperienced workers with low levels of tenure, then this restriction may be violated. In columns 5-8 of table 4, I therefore include additional interactions between experience and tenure squared and the AFQT score and schooling. There is indeed some evidence that the impact of the AFQT score increases more at low experience levels than at high experience levels. However, the interactions between the AFQT score and schooling and tenure and tenure squared continue to be small in magnitude and are statistically insignificant. My overall conclusions are thus unchanged.  \n\nFinally, following Lange (2007), figure 1 presents results where I have allowed the AFQT score and schooling to have a different impact on logwages at each experience level (panel A) and each tenure level (panel B). The dots (AFQT score) and triangles (schooling) refer to the point estimates, while the solid (AFQT score) and dashed (schooling) lines show the predicted value based on the quadratic specification. While the impact of the AFQT score clearly increases and the impact of schooling clearly decreases with experience, there is no clear relationship between the AFQT score (schooling) and tenure. My conclusions thus do not depend on the particular functional form used.  \n\n![](images/faafb30ae14ad1fae10db55bf8b307e18621dffa4b58fa1a98079afa43369688.jpg)  \nF1G. 1.—The relationship between the AFQT score, schooling, experience, and tenure. The figure shows the impact of the AFQT score and schooling on log-wages at each experience (panel A) and tenure (panel B) level. The dots (AFQT-score) and triangles (schooling) refer to the point estimates, while the solid (AFQT-score) and dashed (schooling) lines show the predicted values based on the quadratic specification (table 5, specification 8).  \n\nAn implicit assumption behind the results in table 4 and figure 1 is that schooling increases the productivity of low-ability workers by as much as it does that of high-ability workers. However, the previous section provided some evidence against this assumption, as the adverse selection of movers is stronger for college graduates than for high school graduates. Next, I therefore present results separately by education. Table 5 reports results for both the linear and quadratic specifications. Specifications 1 and 3 control for time effects, industry and occupation affiliation, experience, experience squared, the AFQT score, and the AFQT score interacted with experience. Specifications 2 and 4 add tenure, tenure squared, and the AFQT score interacted with tenure. For high school graduates, the coefficients on the interaction between the AFQT score and tenure are, contrary to the hypothesis of asymmetric learning, negative (though statistically insignificant), for both the linear and quadratic specification. For this education group, I thus do not reject the hypothesis of symmetric employer learning. For college graduates, the results are somewhat mixed. In the linear specification, the coefficient on the interaction between the AFQT score and tenure is negative and statistically insignificant. The quadratic specification, however, reveals that the impact of the AFQT score is first increasing and then decreasing with tenure. The coefficients are jointly significant at a $5\\%$ level. Evaluated at the mean tenure level of 3.37, the impact of the AFQT score is .0314 as compared to .001 at labor market entry. However, this effect is not statistically different from zero ( $\\boldsymbol{\\ p}$ -value $=$ .2638).25  \n\ne q ss u pe x q os  jo du   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">Graduate College High School Graduate</td><td rowspan=\"8\">Quadratic Linear Quadratic Linear</td><td rowspan=\"8\">4 3 2 4 3 2</td><td rowspan=\"8\">(.027) .000 .043**</td><td>.139 (.084) -.056 (<+0) .148 (.104) (.046) -.054 (.059)</td></tr><tr><td>.208** (.026) (220) -.106* 900</td></tr><tr><td>.058* (.024) .044 (.036)</td></tr><tr><td>.057* (.024) .030 (.028)</td></tr><tr><td>.103** .031* (.013) (.038) -.031 (.019) -.051 (.052)</td></tr><tr><td>.096** .027* (.013) (.034) -.029 (.018)</td></tr><tr><td>**6+0* (.011) (.016) -.019 (.027) .042** .044** (.011) (.012)</td></tr><tr><td>100 10 × 100 experience x AFQT × (experience) 10 × × (tenure)² tenure AFQT× × × AFQT AFQT</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n![](images/67fa46eb51f1da55d120de7ebbd3d0d198953d07fdfbe948ac51721275a4781d.jpg)  \nFIG. 2.—The relationship between the AFQT score, experience, and tenure: high school graduates versus college graduates. The figure shows the impact of the AFQT score on log wages at each experience (panel A) and tenure (panel B) level. The dots (high school graduates) and triangles (college graduates) refer to the point estimates, while the solid (high school graduates) and dashed (college graduates) lines plot the predicted value based on the quadratic specification (table 5, specification 4).  \n\nTo further investigate the relationship between AFQT score, experience, and tenure, I next allow the coefficient of the AFQT score to vary with each experience and tenure level. In figure 2, the dots (high school graduates) and triangles (college graduates) refer to the point estimates, while the solid (high school graduates) and dashed (college graduates) plot the predicted value based on the quadratic specification. For both education groups, the impact of the AFQT score becomes larger as experience increases (upper panel).2° For high school graduates, the impact of the AFQT score varies little with tenure (lower panel). Hence, for this education group, my conclusions do not depend on the particular functional form between tenure and the AFQT score: I do not reject the hypothesis of symmetric learning for any specification. For college graduates, the picture is less clear cut. The impact of the AFQT score rises with tenure up to the fifth year in the job; after that, the coefficients are—possibly due to the small sample size imprecisely estimated.27 They jump around a lot, and they sometimes take rather large negative values. It is difficult to draw a definite conclusion from this analysis. The next section summarizes my results and discusses alternative explanations for my findings.  \n\n## VI. Discussion and Interpretation  \n\nWhen workers enter the labor market, employers are likely to have only imperfect information about workers’ productivities. The question of this article is this: Do both incumbent and recruiting firms symmetrically learn about workers' productivities with time in the labor market, or do incumbent firms have superior information about workers′ productivities (asymmetric learning)? I develop a simple learning model that nests both learning hypotheses, and I propose new tests to discriminate between these two hypotheses. Overall, learning appears to be largely symmetric. There is little evidence that workers who leave the firm are negatively selected, in particular if one conditions on industry and occupation affiliation. Moreover, the impact of the AFQT score increases with experience but varies little with tenure. Similarly, the impact of schooling slightly decreases with experience but changes little with tenure.  \n\nThere are, however, important differences across education groups. My results for high school graduates mirror those for all education groups. In my view, the strongest piece of evidence against asymmetric learning for this education group is that firm-movers are not negatively selected. Adverse selection, however, is a robust feature of all asymmetric learning models with mobility that I know of.28 A further piece of evidence against asymmetric learning is that the impact of the AFQT score increases with experience but changes little with tenure.  \n\nThe AFQT score provides a summary measure for basic literacy and numeric skills. It is generally seen as a good proxy of workers cognitive abilities, but it is probably not as good a proxy for their noncognitive skills, such as reliability, work ethic, and communication skills. It may be argued that, in jobs that are typically performed by high school graduates, noncognitive skills play a more important role than cognitive skills. For high school graduates, the AFQT score may therefore not be the right ability measure to discriminate between asymmetric and symmetric learning. My results do not rule out the possibility that incumbent firms have superior information about workers’ noncognitive skills. Unfortunately, my data do not allow me to detect this. However, I would like to stress that the AFQT score is strongly correlated not only with wages of college graduates but also with wages of high school graduates. Hence, the reason why I do not reject the hypothesis of symmetric learning for high school graduates is not that the AFQT score has little impact on wages.  \n\nFor college graduates, in contrast, my results are somewhat mixed. On the one hand, low-ability workers are more likely to switch frms than are high-ability workers. This adverse selection is not fully explained by the sorting of high-ability workers into occupations and industries with low turnover rates. Moreover, the adverse selection of movers is not only driven by low-ability workers being more likely to become unemployed but also by low-ability workers being more likely to move from job to job. On the other hand, there is no clear-cut evidence that the impact of the AFQT score rises with tenure. This appears to be the case for low levels of tenure (≤ 4 years). For higher levels of tenure, however, my estimates are very imprecise, and—contrary to the hypothesis of asymmetric learning—they sometimes take large negative values.  \n\nMoreover, there may be explanations other than asymmetric learning for my findings for college graduates. One possible candidate is a human capital model in which more able workers accumulate more firm-specific human capital. Like asymmetric learning, such a model predicts that highability workers are less likely to switch firms. It also implies that the impact of the AFQT score rises with tenure. Several studies find that education (e.g., Mincer 1988; Lynch 1992), as well as high aptitude and achievement measures (Altonji and Spletzer 1991), increase the probability of receiving training, and thus they illustrate that a complementarity between ability and firm-specific human capital is of potential concern.  \n\nAnother possible explanation for my findings for college graduates is an assignment model combined with symmetric employer learning. Consider a two-period symmetric learning model (in the spirit of Gibbons and Katz 1992) with two types of frms, $A$ and $B$ Productivity in type $B$ frms is more sensitive to ability than productivity in type $A$ frms; in particular, assume that the productivity of low-ability and high-ability workers in firms of type $A$ and $B$ can be ranked as follows: $y_{H,B}>$ $y_{H,A}>y_{L,B}>y_{L,A}$ This ranking implies that, efficiently, high-ability workers are assigned to firm $B$ and low-ability workers are assigned to firm $A$ Unlike as in my model, there are no nonpecuniary job characteristics and wages are equal to expected productivity. Each period, firms receive a signal about a worker's ability. As in my set-up, the signal can take two values, good $(G)$ and bad $(B)$ . While this model does not necessarily produce the same implications as my asymmetric learning model, there is a parameterization for which this is the case. Suppose that, in the first period, all workers are assigned to firms of type $B$ , regardless of whether they received a good or a bad signal. In the second period, all workers who generated two bad signals move down to type $A$ frms. The probability of receiving two bad signals is higher for low-ability workers than for high-ability workers $(q^{2}$ Vs. $(1-q)^{2})$ ; hence, movers are negatively selected in terms of ability.? Moreover, note that all movers work in type A firms, and earn a wage equal to the expected productivity of workers with two bad signals in type $A$ firms. Wages of movers thus do not depend on ability. Wages of stayers, in contrast, vary with ability,3° as stayers consist of workers who received either two good or one good and one bad signal. Hence, for this parameterization, the model also predicts that the impact of ability measures rise with tenure. I am not able to rule out this alternative explanation.  \n\nTo conclude, learning about cognitive ability appears to be largely symmetric. However, for college graduates, the empirical evidence is potentially consistent with a model of asymmetric employer learning. There may, however, be alternative explanations for my findings.  \n\n## Appendix A  \n\n### Theory Appendix  \n\n#### 1. Uniqueness of Equilibrium  \n\nTo simplify the notation, I drop the superscripts $k$ (college) and $s$ (signal). The argument is the same for workers with a good or a bad signal  \n\n29 If, in contrast, all workers are initially assigned to firm A and workers receiving two good signals in a row move to firm B, the model predicts that highability workers are more likely to switch firms.  \n\n30 Wages of high-ability workers who stay with the firm equal  \n\n$$\n\\frac{q^{2}w_{\\scriptscriptstyle B}^{\\scriptscriptstyle G G}+q(1-q)w_{\\scriptscriptstyle B}^{\\scriptscriptstyle G B}}{q^{2}+q(1-q)},\n$$  \n\nwhile wages of low-ability workers who stay with the frm equal  \n\n$$\n\\frac{q(1-q)w_{B}^{B G}+(1-q)^{2}w_{B}^{G G}}{q(1-q)+(1-q)^{2}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{W}}_{f}^{s s}$ denotes the wage of workers with signal sequence ss in $\\mathrm{frm}f;s=$ $G,B;f=A,B.$  \n\nand for workers who did or did not attend college. From (3), the firstorder condition for incumbent firms is  \n\n$$\nw_{i}=y_{i}-\\frac{1-G(v-w_{i})}{g(v-w_{i})},i=L,H.\n$$  \n\nFrom (4), wage offers of outside firms are implicitly defined as  \n\n$$\nv=\\frac{p G(v-w_{L})y_{L}+(1-p)G(v-w_{H})y_{H}}{p G(v-w_{L})+(1-p)G(v-w_{H})}.\n$$  \n\nLog-concavity of $G$ ensures that $[1-G(v-w_{i})]/g(v-w)$ is nondecreasing in $\\boldsymbol{\\varpi}$ . Hence, the incumbent's objective function is quasi-concave and the second-order conditions for a maximum are satisfied.  \n\nI next show that the equilibrium is unique. Totally differentiating (A1) with respect to $\\boldsymbol{v}$ yields  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d w_{i}}{d v}=\\frac{\\big[g_{i}^{2}+(1-G_{i})g_{i}^{\\prime}\\big]/g_{i}^{2}}{1+\\big[g_{i}^{2}+(1-G_{i})g_{i}^{\\prime}\\big]/g_{i}^{2}},\n$$  \n\nwhere $G_{i}=G(v-w_{i})$ and $g_{i}=g(v-w_{i})$ .By  log-concavity of $G_{i}$ $[g_{i}^{2}+(1-G_{i})g_{i}^{\\prime}]/g_{i}^{2}>0$ . Hence, an increase in $\\boldsymbol{v}$ by one unit increases $\\boldsymbol{{\\mathscr{w}}}_{i}$ , but it does so by less than one unit. If an increase in $\\varpi_{L}$ and $\\varpi_{H}$ by one unit also increases $\\boldsymbol{v}$ by less than one unit, then the equilibrium is unique. Totally differentiating (A2) and $\\ w_{H}$ yields  \n\n$$\n\\frac{[\\rlap/p(1-\\rlap/p)(y_{H}-y_{L})(g_{L}G_{H}d w_{L}-G_{L}g_{H}d w_{H})]/[\\rlap/p G_{L}+(1-\\rlap/p)G_{H}]^{2}}{1+\\{[\\rlap/p(1-\\rlap/p)(y_{H}-y_{L})(g_{L}G_{H}d w_{L}-G_{L}g_{H}d w_{H})]/[\\rlap/p G_{L}+(1-\\rlap/p)G_{H}]^{2}\\}}.\n$$  \n\nLog-concavity of $G$ ensures that an increase in $\\varpi_{L}$ and $\\varpi_{H}$ by one unit leads to an increase of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ by less than a unit.  \n\n#### 2. Wage Determination in the First Period  \n\nIn the first period, frms observe a worker's education but not his or her ability. First-period wages therefore depend on education but not on ability. In the first period, firms bid up wages until they earn zero expected profits. Note that, in the second period, workers are paid a wage below their productivity, due to nonpecuniary job characteristics as well as (possibly) information asymmetries. This implies that first-period wages exceed expected productivity.  \n\nLet $\\Pi^{k}$ $k=C,N,$ . denote the firm's expected proft in the second period. First-period wages then satisfy  \n\n$$\nW^{k}=p^{k}y_{L}^{k}+(1-p^{k})y_{H}^{k}+\\Pi^{k}.\n$$  \n\n#### 3. The Impact of Ability on the Probability of Moving  \n\nI first show that if $q=1$ , then wage offers of incumbent firms are equal to the worker's productivity minus a (positive) constant. For simplicity, I drop the superscript $k$ With symmetric learning, outside firms offer $\\boldsymbol{v}_{i}=\\boldsymbol{y}_{i}$ . Totally differentiating the incumbent firm's first-order condition (A1) with respect to $y_{i}$ and using $\\boldsymbol{v}_{i}=\\boldsymbol{y}_{i}$ yields  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d w_{i}}{d y_{i}}=1.\n$$  \n\nHence, an increase in productivity by one unit raises wage offers of incumbent firms by one unit; wage offers of incumbent firms are therefore equal to the worker's productivity minus a constant. This implies that highability workers are as likely to switch frms as are low-ability workers.  \n\nNext, I show that, if $q<1$ , low-ability workers are more likely to leave the firm than are high-ability workers, unconditional on the signal observed by employers. The probability that a low-ability worker leave the firm equals  \n\n$$\nq G(v^{B}-w_{L}^{B})+(1-q)G(v^{G}-w_{L}^{G}),\n$$  \n\nwhile the probability that a high-ability worker leaves the firm equals  \n\n$$\nq G(v^{G}-w_{H}^{G})+(1-q)G(v^{B}-w_{H}^{B}).\n$$  \n\nThe following two conditions are sufficient for the quit rate of low-ability workers to be higher than that of high-ability workers:  \n\n$$\nG(v^{B}-w_{L}^{B})-G(v^{G}-w_{H}^{G})>0\\Leftrightarrow w_{H}^{G}-w_{L}^{B}>v^{G}-v^{B},\n$$  \n\n$$\nG(v^{G}-w_{L}^{G})-G(v^{B}-w_{H}^{B})>0\\Leftrightarrow v^{G}-v^{B}>w_{L}^{G}-w_{H}^{B}.\n$$  \n\nConsider inequality (A3). Suppose $q=0.5$ . In this case,. $v^{s}=v^{G}=v;$ $w_{H}^{G}=w_{H}^{B}=\\bar{w}_{H};$ and $\\boldsymbol{w}_{L}^{G}=\\boldsymbol{w}_{L}^{B}=\\boldsymbol{w}_{L}$ . Clearly, the inequality holds. Next, suppose that $q=1$ . In this case, $w_{H}^{G}-w_{L}^{B}=v^{G}-v^{B}=a_{H}-a_{L}$ Hence, if one can show that, for $q\\leq0.5<1$ ， $d[(w_{H}^{G}-w_{L}^{B})-(v^{G}-v^{B})]/d q<0,$ then inequality (A3) holds. A sufficient condition for this to be the case is $d(w_{H}^{G}-\\bar{v^{G}})/d q<0$ and $d(v^{B}-w_{L}^{B})/d q<0$ Totally differentiating the firstorder condition (A1) yields  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d w_{i}^{s}}{d q}=\\frac{[g_{i}^{s2}+(1-G_{i}^{s})g_{i}^{s^{\\prime}}]/g_{i}^{s2}}{1+\\{[g_{i}^{s2}+(1-G_{i}^{s})g_{i}^{s^{\\prime}}]/g_{i}^{s2}\\}}\\frac{d v^{s}}{d q}.\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\frac{d w_{H}^{G}}{d q}-\\frac{d v^{G}}{d q}=-\\frac{1}{1+\\{[g_{H}^{G2}+(1-G_{H}^{G})g_{H}^{G^{\\prime}}]/g_{H}^{G2}\\}}\\frac{d v^{G}}{d q}}}\\ {{\\displaystyle\\frac{d v^{B}}{d q}-\\frac{d w_{L}^{B}}{d q}=\\frac{1}{1+\\{[g_{L}^{B^{2}}+(1-G_{L}^{B})g_{L}^{B^{\\prime}}]/g_{L}^{B^{2}}\\}}\\frac{d v^{B}}{d q}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBy log-concavity of $G$ $;d w_{H}^{G}/d q-d v^{G}/d q<0$ if $d v^{G}/d q>0$ and $d v^{B}/d q-d w_{L}^{B}/d q<0$ if $d v^{B}/d q<\\bar{0}$ . Formally,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\frac{d\\underline{{v}}^{G}}{d q}=}\\ &{\\frac{\\big[p(1-p)G_{L}^{G}G_{I_{I}^{H}}^{H}(y_{I}-y_{I})\\big]\\big[p(1-q)G_{L}^{G}+(1-p)q G_{I_{I}^{G}}^{G}\\big]^{2}}{1+\\big\\{\\big[(y_{H}-y_{I})p(1-p)q(1-q)(G_{H_{I}^{G}G_{L}^{G}C_{L}^{G}}-G_{L}^{G}g_{H_{I}^{G}C_{I}^{G}}^{G})\\big]\\big/p(1-q)G_{L}^{G}+(1-p)q G_{H_{I}^{G}}^{G}\\big\\}\\big]^{2}}>0,}\\ &{\\frac{d\\underline{{v}}^{B}}{d q}=}\\ &{-\\frac{\\big[p(1-p)G_{L}^{B}G_{H}^{B}(y_{H}-y_{I})\\big]\\big[p q G_{I}^{B}+(1-p)(1-q)G_{H}^{B}\\big]^{2}}{1+\\big\\{\\big[(y_{H}-y_{I})p(1-p)q(1-q)(G_{H}^{B}g_{L}^{B}-G_{I}^{B}g_{L}^{B})\\big]\\big/p q G_{I}^{B}+(1-p)(1-q)G_{H}^{B}\\big\\}^{2}}<0,}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $c_{i}^{s}=1/\\{1+[g_{i}^{s2}+(1-G_{i}^{s})g_{i}^{s^{\\prime}}]/g_{i}^{s2}\\}$ . These results are intuitive: if the precision of the signal increases, then the probability that a worker is of high (low) ability increases if a good (bad) signal is observed.  \n\nNext, consider inequality (A4). Clearly, for $q=0.5$ , the condition is satisfied, as the left-hand side is zero and the right-hand side is negative. Hence, if I can show that $d[(v^{G}-v^{B})-(w_{L}^{G}-w_{H}^{B})]/d q>0,$ inequality (A4) holds. A sufficient condition for this to be the case is $d(v^{G}-w_{L}^{G})/d q>0$ and $d(w_{H}^{B}-v^{B})/d q>0$ . This is true if $d v^{G}/d q>0$ and $d v^{B}/d q<0$ , and this was shown above. Hence, low-ability workers are more likely to leave the firm unconditional on the signal observed (integrating over the signal distribution).  \n\n#### 4. The Impact of Ability on Wage Offers of Incumbent and Outside Firms  \n\nThis section shows that, if $q<1$ , wage offers of incumbent firms vary more with ability than wage offers of outside firms, unconditional on the signal observed by employers. The difference between wage offers of incumbent firms to high-ability and low-ability workers equals  \n\n$$\nE[w|H]-E[w|L]=[q w_{H}^{G}+(1-q)w_{H}^{B})]-[q w_{L}^{B}+(1-q)w_{L}^{G}],\n$$  \n\nwhile the difference between wage offers of outside firms to high-ability and low-ability workers equals  \n\n$$\nE[v|H]-E[v|L]=[q v^{\\alpha}+(1-q)v^{\\beta}]-[q v^{\\beta}+(1-q)v^{\\alpha}].\n$$  \n\nI have to show that $E[w|H]-E[w|L]>E[v|H]-E[w|L]$ The following two conditions are sufficient for this to hold:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{w_{H}^{G}-w_{L}^{B}+v^{B}-v^{G}>0}\\ {-w_{H}^{G}-w_{L}^{G}+w_{H}^{B}-v^{B}>0.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThese are conditions (A3) and (A4), which were proved in Appendix A, Section 3.  \n\n#### 5. The Impact of Schooling on Wage Offers of Incumbent and Outside Firms  \n\nThis section shows that, for $q<1$ , wage offers of outside firms vary more with education than wage offers of incumbent firms, conditional on ability. I present the analysis for low-ability workers, but the same argument applies to high-ability workers. The average difference between wage offers of incumbent firms to high school graduates and college graduates equals  \n\n$$\nE[w|C,L]-E[w|N,L]=q(w_{L}^{C,B}-w_{L}^{N,B})+(1-q)(w_{L}^{C,G}-w_{L}^{N,G}),\n$$  \n\nwhile the average difference between wage offers of outside firms to high school graduates and college graduates equals  \n\n$$\nE[v|C,L]-E[v|N,L]=q(v^{C,B}-v^{N,B})+(1-q)(v^{C,G}-v^{N,G}).\n$$  \n\nI have to show that $E[w|C,L]-E[w|N,L]<E[v|C,L]-E[v|N,L].$ A sufficient condition for this inequality to hold is, for good as well as bad signals, $\\begin{array}{r}{w_{L}^{C,s}-w_{L}^{N,s}<v^{C,s}-v^{N,s}}\\end{array}$ Note that for $s=0$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}^{N}=\\boldsymbol{p}^{C},$ $\\mathcal{w}_{i}^{C,s}=\\mathcal{w}_{i}^{N,s}$ and $v^{C,s}=v^{N,s}$ . Hence, if an increase in $s$ and a decline in $\\boldsymbol{p}^{c}$ raises wage offers of outside firms by at least as much as wage offers of incumbent firms, then $\\boldsymbol{w}_{i}^{C,s}-\\boldsymbol{w}_{i}^{N,s}<\\boldsymbol{v}^{C,s}-\\boldsymbol{v}^{N,s}$ Since schooling has the same impact on the productivity of low-ability and high-ability workers,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d v^{C,s}}{d s}=\\frac{d w_{i}^{C,s}}{d s}=1.\n$$  \n\nTotally differentiating (A1) with respect to $(1-p^{C})$ yields  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d w_{i}^{C,s}}{d(1-\\mathrm{\\Delta}p^{C})}=\\frac{[g_{i}^{C,s2}+(1-G_{i}^{C,s})g_{i}^{C,s^{\\prime}}]/g_{i}^{C,s2}}{1+\\{[g_{i}^{C,s2}+(1-G_{i}^{C,s})g_{i}^{C,s^{\\prime}}]/g_{i}^{C,s2}\\}}\\frac{d v^{C,s}}{d(1-\\mathrm{\\Delta}p^{C})}.\n$$  \n\nBy log-concavity of $G,d w_{i}^{C,s}/d(1-p^{C})<d v^{C,s}/d(1-p^{C})$ Hence, school  \n\ning has a greater impact on wage offers of outside firms than on those of incumbent firms for both low-ability and high-ability workers.  \n\n#### 6. Complementarity between Ability and Schooling  \n\nI first show that if ability and education are complements, then the difference between the impact of ability on wage offers of incumbent firms and outside firms is stronger for college graduates than for high school graduates. Consequently, the adverse selection is stronger for college graduates than for high school graduates. For simplicity, I model the complementarity between ability and education in a multiplicative manner, that is,  \n\n$$\ny_{L}^{C}=s\\times a_{L},~y_{H}^{C}=s\\times a_{H},~y_{L}^{N}=a_{L},~\\mathrm{and}~y_{H}^{N}=a_{H}.\n$$  \n\nI have to show that  \n\n$$\n(\\underbrace{E[w|C,H]-E[w|C,L]})-(E[v|C,H]-E[v|C,L]).\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\geq\\frac{(E[w|N,H]-E[w|N,L])-(E[v|N,H]-E[v|N,L])}{\\mathrm{high~school~graduates}}\n$$  \n\nRewriting,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\left[(q w_{H}^{C,G}+(1-q)w_{H}^{C,B})-(q w_{L}^{C,B}+(1-q)w_{L}^{C,G}\\right]}\\ &{\\quad-\\left[(q v^{C,G}+(1-q)v^{C,B}\\right]-\\left[q v^{C,B}+(1-q)v^{C,G}\\right]\\geq}\\ &{\\left[(q w_{H}^{N,G}+(1-q)w_{H}^{N,B})-(q w_{L}^{N,B}+(1-q)w_{L}^{N,G})\\right]}\\ &{\\quad-\\left[(q v^{N,G}+(1-q)v^{N,B}\\right]-\\left[q v^{N,B}+(1-q)v^{N,G}\\right].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nRearranging,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{q(w_{H}^{C,G}-v^{C,G})+(1-q)(w_{H}^{C,B}-v^{C,B})}\\ &{\\quad+q(v^{C,B}-w_{L}^{C,B})+(1-q)(v^{C,G}-w_{L}^{C,G})\\geq}\\ &{q(w_{H}^{N,G}-v^{N,G})+(1-q)(w_{H}^{N,B}-v^{N,B})}\\ &{\\quad+q(v^{N,B}-w_{L}^{N,B})+(1-q)(v^{N,G}-w_{L}^{N,G}).}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSuppose that $\\boldsymbol{p}^{N}=\\boldsymbol{p}^{C}=\\boldsymbol{p}$ 31 If $s=0$ . then $v^{C,s}=v^{N,s}$ and $\\mathcal{w}_{i}^{C,s}=\\mathcal{w}_{i}^{N,s}$ Hence, a sufficient condition for the inequality given above to hold is that an increase in $s$ raises incumbent wage offers of high-ability workers by more and wage offers of low-ability workers by less than outside wage offers regardless of which type of signal is observed. Totally differentiating (A1) yields  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{d w_{L}^{s}}{d s}=\\frac{a_{L}+\\big(\\{[g_{L}^{s^{2}}+(1-G_{L}^{s})g_{L}^{s^{\\prime}}]/g_{L}^{s2}\\}\\{d v^{s}/d s\\}\\big)}{1+\\{[g_{L}^{s^{2}}+(1-G_{L}^{s})g_{L}^{s^{\\prime}}]/g_{L}^{s^{2}}\\}},}\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{d w_{H}^{s}}{d s}=\\frac{a_{H}+\\big(\\{[g_{H}^{s^{2}}+(1-G_{H}^{s})g_{H}^{s^{\\prime}}]/g_{H}^{s2}\\}\\{d v^{s}/d s\\}\\big)}{1+\\{[g_{H}^{s^{2}}+(1-G_{H}^{s})g_{H}^{s^{\\prime}}]/g_{H}^{s^{2}}\\}}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence, $d w_{L}^{C,s}/d s<d v^{C,s}/d s<d w_{H}^{C,s}/d s$ if $a_{L}<d v^{C,s}/d s<a_{H}.$ Totally differentiating (A2) with respect to $s$ yields the equation that is displayed as figure A1. It may be verified that $a_{L}<d v^{C,B}/d s<a_{H}.$ . A similar formula can be derived for $v^{C,G}$  \n\nNext, I argue that, for high-ability workers, education may have a stronger or a weaker impact on wage offers of incumbent firms than those of outside firms. From Appendix A, Section 5, I can be sure that wage offers of outside frms are more sensitive to education than wage offers of incumbent firms if an increase in $s$ and a decrease in $\\boldsymbol{p}^{c}$ increases wage offers of outside firms by more than wage offers of incumbent firms. While a decrease $\\boldsymbol{p}^{c}$ continues to have a stronger impact on outside wage offers (i.e., $d w_{i}^{C,s}/d(\\bar{1}-p^{C})<d v^{C,s}/d(1-p^{C}))$ s has, for high-ability workers, a stronger impact on incumbent wage offers (i.e., $d w_{H}^{C,s}/d s>d v^{C,s}/d s)$ . For lowability workers, in contrast, both effects work in the same direction (i.e., $d w_{L}^{C,s}/d s<d v^{C,s}/d s)$  \n\n## Appendix B Data Appendix  \n\n### 1. Definition of Labor Market Entry  \n\nMy definition for a transition from school to work closely follows Farber and Gibbons's (1996) definition. The difference between their def  \n\n31 With asymmetric learning, the adverse selection, as well as the difference between the impact of ability in incumbent and outside wage offers, may vary with education even if ability and education are not complements. This is because the ability distribution may be more or less dispersed for college graduates than for high school graduates. The informational asymmetry tends to be the smaller the closer the fraction of low-ability workers is to O or 1. However, results from numerical simulations show that it is not necessarily true that the adverse selection and the difference between the impact of ability on wage offers of incumbent and outside firms is strongest when $\\bar{p=.5}$  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>HD （To-Ho）（o-t)b（4-t）ds</td><td>上 C.B2 D（b-t)（d-1）+gDbd] +1</td><td></td><td>6 十</td><td>（7D-Ho）(b-1)b(d-1）ds</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\ninition and mine is that my definition is based on calendar years, theirs on interview years. I prefer calendar years because the time between two interviews varies from 9 to 40 or more months. According to this definition, labor market entry takes place when the worker was classified as nonworking for at least 1 year, followed by at least 2 consecutive years classified as working. A worker is classified as working when he has worked full time at least 26 weeks in a calendar year. It sometimes happens that the worker was employed for the same employer before he made the transition from school to work. I include these spells in my analysis.  \n\n### 2. Creation of Spell Data from Quarterly Data  \n\nFor my second set of tests, I transform the quarterly data set into a spell data set. Here, I first drop all nonemployment spells. I then keep one valid observation per job and interview year. I drop observations for the sixth job and higher in an interview year since the NLSY collects information on only a maximum of five jobs between two interviews. It sometimes happens that the worker's secondary job becomes his main job. In this case, the job number in the quarterly data changes although the worker does not switch employers. If the (previously) secondary job started after and ended before the main job, I ignore it. It can also happen that the “new\" job in the quarterly data started before the previous job started or that the previous job ended after the “new\" job ended. When jobs overlap in this way, I only consider the job at which the worker worked most. After eliminating dual jobs in this way, I compute the tenure and experience variables. I then drop part-time jobs $(<30$ hours), jobs without pay, jobs of the self-employed, and jobs in the agricultural sector. I also drop observations where the wage is smaller than $\\$1$ Or greater than $\\$500$  \n\n### 3. Variable Definitions  \n\nProbability of moving:  For each quarter, I observe the worker's employment status and job number (main job) at the beginning of the quarter, as well as the week he started and stopped working for the employer. I use this information to compute quarterly quit rates. It is possible that a worker temporarily leaves his job (e.g., because he is on recall) and returns to the job later. I consider these workers as stayers. It sometimes happens that the worker's secondary job becomes his main job. In this case, the job number in the quarterly data changes. I consider these workers as movers.  \n\nProbability of a job-to-job and job-to-unemployment transition: I consider a firm switch as a job-to-unemployment transition if the respondent reported that he was actively searching for a job between the two employment spells. My results are similar if I classify a transition as a job-to-unemployment transition if the worker started the new job 4 weeks or later after his old job ended, independently of whether the worker was actively looking for a job.  \n\nEducation and bighest grade: The definition for education is based on the variable “highest grade completed.\" High school graduates are workers who, during their last interview year, had less than 16 years of education. High school graduates include high school dropouts as well as college dropouts. College graduates are workers who, during their last interview year, had at least 16 years of education. For workers with less than 8 years of schooling, I assign a highest grade of 8. There are some inconsistencies in the variable “highest grade completed.\" For instance, it may happen that in 3 consecutive years the education variable first increases and then decreases by 1 year. In these cases, I assign the lower value in the first and third year.  \n\nExperience and tenure, spell data:  Actual experience is measured as weeks (divided by 53) spent in employment after the transition from school to work. It is based on the start and stop date of each job. Tenure is measured as weeks (divided by 53) spent in employment with the same employer. As actual experience, the tenure variable is based on the start and stop date of each job. (Hence, time on recall is counted as experience and tenure.)  \n\nExperience and tenure, quarterly data: For the quarterly data, I compute experience as the sum of the number of weeks worked in a quarter (divided by 53). Tenure is computed as the sum of the number of weeks worked for the same employer in a quarter (divided by 53).  \n\nWage rate:  The wage rate is the hourly wage rate, which was computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I assume that wages refer to tenure and experience at the end of the employment spell. Results change very little if we assume that wages refer to tenure and experience at the beginning of each employment spell. I deflate wages by the Consumer Price Index with 1982 as the base year.  \n\nOccupation and industry affiliation: I distinguish seven occupations: professional, technical, and kindred; managers; sales workers, clerical and kindred; craftsmen, foremen, and kindred; operatives and kindred; laborers; and service workers. I distinguish 12 industries: mining; construction; manufacturing; transportation, communication, and public utilities; wholesale trade; retail trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; business and repair services; personnel services; entertainment and recreation services; professional and related services; and public administration.  \n\n## References  \n\nAcemoglu, Daron, and Jorn-Steffen Pischke. 1998.

Among other distinguished scholars, it included all of my thesis advisers—Kenneth Arrow, Thomas Schelling,and Richard Zeckhauser.In the courseofthatseminar therewerediscussionsof statistical discrimination and many other subjects that relate to the incompleteness of information in markets. One of my advisers came in one day with the strong suggestion that I read a paper he had just read called “The Market for ‘Lemons'” by George A. Akerlof (1970). I always did what my advisers told me to do and hence followed up immediately. It was quite electrifying. There we all found a wonderfully clear and plausible analysis of the performance characteristics of a market with incomplete and asymmetrically located information. That, combined with my puzzlement about several aspects of the discussion of the consequences of incomplete information in job markets, pretty much launched me on a search for things that I came to call signals, that would carry information persistently in equilibrium from sellers to buyers, or more generally from those with more to those with less information.1 The issue, of course, was that signals are not terribly complicated things in games where the parties have the same incentives, i.e., where there is a commonly understood desire to communicate accurate information to each other. Even in that case (sometimes called the pure coordination case), however, there are potential problems of choosing among equilibria as illustrated in Thomas Schelling's (1960) brilliant analysis of the use of focal points and contextual information to solve  communication/coordination  problems when the parties have been deprived of the ability to communicate directly. In markets where the issue is often undetectable or imperfectly detectable quality differentials, the alignment of incentives is typically imperfect and the incentive of the high-quality product owners to distinguish themselves and the incentive of the low-quality owners to imitate the signal so as to obscure the distinction is fairly clear. Of course there is more to it, as one needs to know such things as who is in the market persistently and hence who has an incentive to establish a reputation through repeated plays of the game. I am going to devote a good portion of this lecture to these issues, in a sense to revisit signaling, and then turn to some other aspects of the informational structure of markets that are raised by the parameter shifts caused by the proliferation of the Internet as a communication medium in the pastfewyears.  \n\nI was asked recently by a somewhat incredulous questioner (actually, a journalist) whether itwastruethatyoucouldbeawardedtheNobel Prize in Economics for simply noticing that there are markets in which certain participants do not know certain things that others in the market do know. I thought it was pretty funny. It was as if this had somehow been a closely guarded secret up until about 1970, at least in economics. I clearly cannot speak for those who make the decisions about the Nobel Prize, but I suspect that the correct answer to that question is no. What did blossom at that time was a serious attempt by many talented economists to capture  in applied microeconomic  theory a whole variety of aspects of market structure and performance. That work produced a partial melding of theory, industrial organization, labor economics, finance, and other fields. An important early part of that effort was the attempt to capture informational aspects of market structure to study the ways in which markets adapt, and the consequences of informational gaps for market performance.  \n\nTherefore, in answer to the question, we noticed that there are many markets with informational gaps. These include most consumer durables, virtually all job markets, many financial markets, markets for various types of food and pharmaceuticals, and many more. These informational gaps were widely acknowledged and those of us who taught applied microeconomic theory freely admitted that these gaps might change some of the performance characteristics, not to mention the institutional structure, of markets in which they appear. But I think it is fair to say that we did not have much systematic knowledge based on theory of what those changes might be. And so we thought that applied microeconomic theory deserved an attempt to build these informational characteristics into models that capture the structure and performance of these markets with reasonably accurate assumptions about the ex ante informational conditions. It was a very exciting time for all of us who were involved. One of the wonderful aspects of receiving this award is that it has triggered in me, and I think others, fond memories of the sense of discovery and excitement. And in that context, I would like to take this opportunity to express my admiration and deep gratitude to the many extant young colleagues with whom I worked and shared these ideas. They should, and certainly in my mind do, share in the recognition triggered by the awarding of the distinguished Nobel Prize for what was accomplished during those years.  \n\nThe plan for this lecture is as follows. The overriding goal is not to look too stupid to the next generation of students and scholars. More seriously, following the advice that my advisers once gave me, I will first discuss the simplest model that I can devise that illustrates in reasonably general form the definitions and properties of signaling equilibria.? Next, we will allow the signal (in this case education in the job market context) to contribute directly to the productivity of the individual as well as functioning as a signal. Following that, the paper examines a market in which there is signaling and both separating and pooling in the equilibrium.  \n\nThe section after that examines a fairly general partial-equilibrium model of signaling and discusses competitive equilibria and certain kinds of “optimal\" responses to signals.4 Those who are more interested in the general idea and less in the general case can skip over this section without risk of missing any important properties. However this is the section in which the formal relationship between signaling models and models of self-selection and optimal taxation with imperfect information is examined, and that may be of interest to some readers. I also want to introduce in that context a new possibility that I discovered only recently and that is that one can have a signaling equilibrium in which the costs of the signal appear to vary with the unseen ability characteristics in the wrong way. That is to say the costs of education (absolutely and at the margin) rise with ability, or more generally, with the unobserved attribute that contributes positively to productivity. For the most part, I will use the job market case for expositional purposes and comment on some other signaling situations more briefly later in the essay. There is a risk in using job markets to illustrate signaling. In order to illustrate the fundamental properties of signaling models, I have stripped away other features of the market, particularly in the simpler models. But I have noticed in the past that there is a tendency for the simpler models set in the job market context to convey unintended messages such as (1) education does not contribute to productivity, or (2) the information contained in the signal does not increase efficiency. This essay is mainly about the theory of signaling and information transfer in markets, and not mainly about human capital and labor markets. There are many who are more knowledgeable about the latter than I.  \n\nThe paper concludes with two sections. The first of these discusses the ubiquitous use of time and the allocation of time as a signal and as a screening device. The second focuses on the potentially rather large information parameter shifts that the Internet may have caused and speculates a little on how applied models of markets, organizations, and boundaries between them may have changed and on what is needed to capture the effects of these parameter shifts in models of markets and the economy.  \n\n## 1. The Simplest Job Market Signaling Model  \n\nThe idea behind the job market signaling model is that there are attributes of potential employeesthat the employer cannot observe and that affect the individual's subsequent productivity and, hence, value to the employer on the job. Let us suppose that there are just two groups of people. Group 1 has productivity or value to any employer of 1, and group 2 has productivity of 2. In this example, these productivity values do not depend on the level of investment in the signal. If there were no way to distinguish between people in these two groups then if both groups stay in the market, the averagewagewould be $2\\textrm{--}\\alpha$ where $\\alpha$ isthe fraction of the population in group 1, and everyone would get that wage. If the higher productivity group through dissatisfaction or for any other reason exits this labor market, the average productivity and the wage drop to 1. This phenomenon when it occurs is sometimes called the adverse selection problem, a label most commonly applied to insurance markets. It is structurally the same problem that Akerlof (1970) described in his famous paper on used cars (lemons).  \n\nNow suppose that there is something called education, which we will denote by $E$ ,that can be acquired or invested in. It is assumed to be visible, and its acquisition costs differ for the two types. Let us suppose that the cost of $E$ years of education for group 1 is $E$ , and the cost for group 2 individuals is $E/2$ . For this example I am going to assume that education does not affect the individual's productivity. 1 do this purely to keep it simple and not to suggest that human capital, including that acquired through education, is somehow not relevant. In later sections, the assumption will be relaxed.  \n\nEquilibrium in a situation like this, and in general, has two components. First, given the returns to and the costs of investing in education, individuals make rational investment choices with respect to education. Second, employers have beliefs about the relation between the signal and the individual's underlying productivity. These beliefs are based on incoming data from the marketplace. In equilibrium, the beliefs must be consistent, that is, they must not be disconfirmed by the incoming data and the subsequent experience. Therefore, one could say that the beliefs must be accurate. But one should also notice that employers’ beliefs/expectations determine the wage offers that are made at various levels of education. These wage offers in turn determine thereturns toindividuals from investments in education, and finally, those returns determine theinvestment decisions that individuals make with respect to education, and hence the actual relationship between productivity and education that is observed by employers in the marketplace. This is a complete circle. Therefore it is probably more accurate to a say that in equilibrium, the employers’ beliefs are self-confirming. This may sound like a minor restatement but it is important. It is the self-confirming nature of the beliefs that gives rise to the potential presence of multiple equilibria in the market.  \n\nIn the example at hand, suppose that group 1 individuals set $E_{1}=0$ and individuals in group 2 set $E_{2}=E^{\\ast}$ . Suppose further that employers, none of whom individually influence investment decisions by individuals,? believe that if $E<E^{*}$ then productivity is 1 and if $E\\geq E^{*}$ ， then productivity is 2. With these assumptions, individuals in group 1 will rationally set $E=0$ provided that  \n\n$$\n2-E^{*}<1.\n$$  \n\nMembers of group 2 will rationally set $E=E^{*}$ provided that  \n\n$$\n2-\\frac{E^{*}}{2}>1.\n$$  \n\n![](images/036d511bab1bdbcd713bcb53603c63752af62b2741d56eebf4f90199b4d7cdce.jpg)  \nFIGURE 1. THE TWO-GROUP SIGNALING EQUILIBRIUM  \n\nTherefore the choices will be rational and the expectations confirmed in the market if  \n\n$$\n1<E^{*}<2.\n$$  \n\nThough it is a highly stylized example it has many of the general properties of signaling equilibria. There is a continuum of equilibria, in each of which there is more investment in the signal thantherewouldbe in a world of full information. Because investment in the signal dissipates resources without improving productivity, the result is inefficient. Moreover, the equilibria are orderable by the Pareto criterion, that is, as you move from one equilibrium to another, everyone is either worse off or no better off. The signal actually does distinguish low- and high-productivity people and the reason it is able to do so is that the cost of the signal is negatively correlated with the unseen characteristic that is valuable to employers, in this case productivity itself. The equilibrium is characterized by a schedule that gives the returns to education, that is a wage for each level of education, and optimizing choices given that schedule by individuals in the two groups.  \n\nThe equilibrium is depicted in Figure 1. The wage schedule is the dark line and jumps from a wage level of 1 to a wage level of 2 at $e^{*}$ $E^{*}$ is between 1 and 2 so that group 1 chooses the education level 0 and group 2 chooses $E^{*}$ . It is not essential that net income for group 1 at $e^{*}$ is negative as it is in this example. We could make the productivity levels for the two groups 3 and 4. The same signaling result would occur with suitable adjustments in the level of the wage schedule.  \n\nThere are in fact other signaling equilibria. For example, there could be a minimal level of education that group 1 invests in. But unless it is a productive investment, there is no reason to think that over time the market would not discover this and eliminate it as an inefficiency that can be removed costlessly. In the spectrum of equilibria described above, probably the most interesting is the most efficient one. That equilibrium is the one in which $E^{*}=1+\\delta$ where 8 is to be thought of as a small positive number. In this equilibrium,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{w_{1}=N_{1}=1}\\ {{}}\\ {w_{2}=2}\\end{array}\\quad\\begin{array}{l}{{N_{1}=1}}\\ {{N_{2}=1.5-\\delta/2}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $N_{i}$ is income net of signaling costs for group $i$  \n\nOn the assumption that the market will find equilibria that are Pareto efficient, one can ask whether there is a better equilibrium in the Pareto sense(everyone isbetter off)thantheonedescribed above. The answer is sometimes yes. It involves pooling and it depends on the relative sizes of the two groups. What is really going on here is that the market is, in a sense, acting as if it is trying to maximize the net income of the higher productivity group. In some cases that is accomplished by recognizing that it is too expensive for that group to distinguish itself. The alternative is to appear undifferentiated in a pool. That clearly benefits group 1 as they are mistaken for the average productivity, which is above 1. As a reminder, $\\alpha$ is the fraction of the population in group 1. In a pooling situation the average productivity is $2\\textrm{--}\\alpha>1$ . Group 1 would clearly prefer it. Group 2 prefers it as well if  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{2\\mathrm{~-~}\\alpha>1.5\\mathrm{~-~}\\delta/2\\mathrm{,~or}}}\\ {{\\mathrm{~}}}\\ {{\\alpha<0.5\\mathrm{(1~-~}\\delta\\mathrm{)}.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince 8 can be made as small as we want, there is a preferred pooling equilibrium (in the Pareto sense) if in this example, group 1 is less than half the population. In general with discrete groups, pooling with lower-level groups becomes attractive if they are relatively small, because the higher-level groups do not give up too much by being mistaken for the average and they avoid the signaling costs. In a later section I will describe briefly a case in which one can observe pooling and separating in the same equilibrium.  \n\nIf you wanted to make the result in this market more efficient than the equilibria described above, you would tax education (assuming that such a tax is not costly to impose and administer), making it more expensive for group 2, and thereby make it possible to lower the level of education without losing the informational content of the signal. The revenues generated could be distributed equally to all participants in both groups independent of their education choice. The lump-sum component of the tax will therefore not affect their signaling behavior.  \n\nLet $t$ be the tax rate on investment in education and let $k$ be the lump-sum distribution from the tax revenues. This distribution goes to everyone. Let the signaling level of education be $E^{*}$ . Group 1 individuals will rationally choose not to send the signal if  \n\n$$\n2-(1+t)E^{*}+k<1+k\n$$  \n\nand group 2 will rationally send the signal if  \n\n$$\n2-(0.5+t)E^{*}+k>1+k.\n$$  \n\nWe have an equilibrium then if  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{0.5+t}}>E^{*}>{\\frac{1}{1+t}}.\n$$  \n\nWe will pick the efficient end of the signaling spectrum by setting  \n\n$$\nE^{*}=\\frac{1+\\delta}{1+t}.\n$$  \n\nThe lump-sum distribution is equal to the tax revenuessothat  \n\n$$\nk=\\frac{t(1+\\updelta)(1-\\alpha)}{1+t}.\n$$  \n\nThus the equilibrium net incomes are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{N_{1}=1+k}}\\ {{}}\\ {{N_{2}=2-\\displaystyle\\frac{(0.5+t)(1+\\delta)}{1+t}+k.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAs 8 becomes small and $t$ becomes very large, $k$ approaches $(1\\textrm{--}\\alpha)$ , and hence both net incomesapproach $(2\\mathrm{~-~}\\alpha)$ .This, the reader will recall, is the pooling equilibrium outcome in terms of net income. Here however, there is no upper limit on the size of group 1, namely $\\alpha$ Signaling costs (socially) are negligible as $E^{*}$ approaches zero, though the private marginal costs of signaling (including the tax) approach 1.  \n\nTo summarize, one can get rid of the inefficiency and keep the signaling and the informational content of the signals with an appropriate tax on the signaling activity. The effect is to redistribute income in such a way as to reproduce the results of the pooling equilibrium. It could be that the information the signal carries is itself productive. In that case it is important that the equilibrium actually be a separating one.6 That is the case here. Separating is retained in this equilibrium. Groups are correctly identified. The use of a tax on the signaling activity reduces the level of the signal required to distinguish the groups, and hence reduces the inefficiency of the untaxed signaling equilibrium.  \n\n## II. The Two-Group Model When Education Enhances Human Capital and also Serves as a Potential Signal  \n\nIt will naturally occur to the reader to ask what is the effect on the market signaling that we have just examined, at least in the context of labor markets, when the signal also contributes directly to productivity for the individual worker.7 This section addresses the subject by modifying the two-group model of the preceding section to allow education to be productive. I will make the model slightly more general in terms of functional forms. Let $s_{i}(E)$ be the value of a worker of type $I$ with education $E$ to an employer. Here $I=1$ , 2 and we assume that $s_{2}(E)>s_{1}(E)$ , and $s_{2}^{t}(E)>s_{1}^{t}(E)$ . Let $c_{i}(E)$ be the cost of investing in $E$ units of education for group 1 and assume that $c_{1}(e)>c_{2}(e)$ , and that $c_{1}^{t}(E)>c_{2}^{t}(E)$ . These assumptions simply capture the idea that the group with the higher productivity also has the lower costs of signaling. As before, the individual's type is not directly observable. We will also assume that $s_{i}(E)$ is concave, that $c_{i}(E)$ is convex and hence that the net income function $N_{i}(E)=s_{i}(E)\\:-\\:$ $c_{i}(E)$ is concave.  \n\n![](images/02b65eac0210acefbda8de9d258cc90f596736a6f4a8d778b628eeb087bd08b7.jpg)  \nFIGURE 2. TWO-GROUP SIGNALING WITH EDUCATIONAFFECTINGPRODUCTIVITY  \n\nThere are three qualitatively different kinds of equilibria in this market. The first is a fully efficient separating equilibrium. It is easiest to see the types of equilibrium pictorially. In Figure 2, we have various forms of net income plotted as  a function  of $E$ .Let $V_{1}(E)=$ $\\bar{s}_{2}(E)\\:-\\:c_{1}(E)$ . Our interest in the function $V$ clearly relates to the question of whether group 1 will adopt the group 2 signal and hence create a problem with the separating equilibrium.  \n\nIn Figure 2, you will see the functions $N_{1}$ $N_{2}$ , and $V$ The points $E_{1}^{*}$ and $E_{2}^{*}$ are the points that maximize $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ . The point $\\bar{E}$ is the largest value of $E$ such that $V$ is larger than $N_{1}^{*}$ the maximum value of $N_{1}$ . In Figure 1, you can see that $E_{2}^{*}$ is to the right of $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}}$ . This means that as long as the wage offer schedule_jumps up from $s_{1}(E)$ to $s_{2}(E)$ to the right of $\\ddot{E}$ , individuals in group 1 will have no incentive to imitate the signaling behavior of group 2.  \n\nThis is the fully efficient separating equilibrium. The signal carries accurate information, and the investments in education are the efficient ones. The outcome is as if there was perfect information in the market place. In essence, the two groups are sufficiently different in terms of some combination of the productivity of education as human capital and the costs of education that the fully efficient outcome survives as an equilibrium. Note however, that the negative relation between productivity and costs really matters. If signaling costs were the same, then the functions $N_{2}$ and $V$ would be the same and we could not have this market outcome. When signaling costs are the same one can never prevent group 1 from imitating group 2 behavior when it is to their advantage to do so. Now turn to Figure 3. It is essentially the same picture as Figure 2 except that $E_{2}^{*}$ is to the left of $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}}$ . This means that if the wage schedule jumps to $s_{2}(E)$ before $E_{2}^{*}$ , group 1 will imitate group 2 behavior and dismantle the separating equilibrium. To prevent this we will specify that the wage schedule jumps up to $s_{2}(E)$ at $\\bar{E}+\\delta$ Subject to a qualification that I will come to in a minute, this is a separating equilibrium. To achieve the separation, the group 2 investment in education is pushed up above the efficient level, in order for the individuals in that group to achieve the signaling effect and avoid imitation by group 1. So here we have the same kind of result that we had in the no-human-capital case. Here the return to investing in education has a signaling component and a human-capital component. The former can push the levels of investment above the full information optimum. In the first model the human-capital effect was zero, leaving only the signaling effect, an assumption that ensures that overinvestment will occur in any separating equilibrium in which signaling occurs.  \n\n![](images/d6b980d35e9d145d6bcbdb263b1f0a70891c2299040e27f7423298ce2c94d9fc.jpg)  \nFIGURE3.TWO-GROUPMODELWITHOVERINVESTMENT INEDUCATION  \n\nThere remain two issues. One is whether and under what circumstances pooling will destroy the hypothesized separating equilibrium, and the second is: “Can one tax the signal in such a way as to improve market performance? Pooling first. Let $\\alpha$ be the fraction of the total population in group 1. In a pooling equilibrium, the wage for all will be $\\alpha s_{1}(E)~+~(1~-$ $\\alpha)s_{2}(E)$ for any level of $E$ that emerges. This cannot break a fully effcient separating equilibrium because group 2 cannot be better off. Thus if pooling breaks a separating equilibrium it can only be in the case where the more productive group has been forced, for signaling purposes, above its optimal level of $E$ from the standpoint of investment in human capital. Let $W(E)=\\alpha s_{1}(E)+(1-\\alpha)s_{2}(E)$ . By making $\\alpha$ arbitrarily small we can make $W$ as close to $s_{2}(E)$ as we want. Now let us look again at Figure 2. If you start at $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{E}}$ and reduce $E$ and move to the left and up the curves $N_{2}$ and $V.$ it is clear that both groups are better off. For small $\\alpha$ , the net income functions $W\\mathrm{~-~}c_{1}$ and $W-$ $c_{2}$ are close to $V$ and $N_{2}$ . Hence for a range of $\\alpha$ at the low end, pooling will break the separating outcome. For these cases, the natural choices of equilibrium levels of $E$ are those that lie between the education levels that maximize $W\\mathrm{~-~}c_{1}$ and $W\\mathrm{~-~}c_{2}$  \n\nAs $\\alpha$ rises, eventually the function $W\\mathrm{~-~}c_{2}$ will fall below the level of group 2 net income at the separating point $\\bar{E}$ , at which point the pooling outcome is not capable of breaking the separating equilibrium.Tosummarize,inthe case of an inefficient separating equilibrium, there exist pooling equilibria that are Pareto superior to the separating equilibrium provided the size of the lower productivity group is below some threshold level. If the market has a way of finding the pooling equilibria, it will break the separatingone.  \n\nWe turn now to the problem of improving the efficiency of the market. We saw in the preceding section that in the case where there is no human-capital component of productivity, one can in principle come arbitrarily close to the efficient outcome through appropriate taxes. The same is true when the signal adds to the individual's productivity as well as functioning as a signal. We have already seen that in some cases the market equilibrium itself is efficient in the sense of maximizing total net income as part of a separating equilibrium. We now want to show that one can achieve the same result in the case where the higher productivity group has been  forced  by  signaling  considerations  to move above its efficient level of investment in human capital.  \n\nTo achieve an efficient outcome, we want to maximize total net income. To do that we need to have $s_{i}^{t}=c_{i}^{t}$ for $i=1$ , 2. To accomplish that if it is possible, we need a wage function that induces these choices. The wage function can be thought of as a schedule of taxes on education superimposed on a wage function that sets wages equal to productivity. Since each individual in each group considers all possible levels of $E$ in making its education investment decision, it turns out to be easier to solve this problem indirectly rather than directly. Let us suppose therefore that counter to fact, there is a continuum of types specified by the parameter $z$ where productivity for type $z$ is $z s_{1}+(1-$ $z)s_{2}$ and costs for type $z$ are $z c_{1}+(1-z)c_{2}$ Let $E(z)$ maximize  \n\n$$\nz(s_{1}-c_{1})+(1-z)(s_{2}-c_{2}).\n$$  \n\nNote that $E(z)$ declines as a function of z. Invert $E(z)$ to get $Z(E)$ . If the wage schedule we are looking for is $w(e)$ , then individuals will have maximized by setting  \n\n$$\nw^{t}=z c_{1}^{t}+(1-z)c_{2}^{t}.\n$$  \n\nSubstitute $Z(E)$ into the differential equation above and integrate with respect to $E$ setting the constant so that total wages equal total output. This wage schedule and/or the implied tax schedule will induce the efficient choices of $E$ .8  \n\nThe reader will notice that the optimal wage schedule above does not depend on the distribution of $z$ in the population.? Therefore let us assume that almost all the weight in the distribution is at either $z=0$ or $z=1$ . These are the two group cases we are studying.  \n\nTo summarize, with two groups and education as productive human capital, one can have a signaling equilibrium with full efficiency or overinvestment in education by the more productive group. You can also have a pooling equilibrium that dominates the separating equilibrium provided that the less productive group is not too large. And finally there exists a tax/ subsidy scheme that produces a fully efficient separating outcome as an equilibrium.  \n\n## III. A Model with Signaling, Selection, and Pooling'0  \n\nThe model we are going to look at briefly in this section is of interest for two reasons. First, it illustrates a case in which there is both pooling and separating components of the equilibrium and,second,itshows that the critical criterion for having a separating component in an equilibrium is that the net benefits of issuing the signal are positively correlated with an unseen attribute that contributes positively to productivity. This positive correlation can result, as in preceding examples, from signaling costs that arenegativelycorrelatedwith thevaluedattribute. That is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for a separating equilibrium. In this very nice example the information is acquired at a fixed cost and the positive correlation comes from subsequent discovery of the attribute post-employment.  \n\nThe idea behind the model is that the value of individuals to firms is not directly observed, at least at the time of hiring. The value which we will denote by $q$ is distributed on the interval $[q_{\\mathrm{min}},~q_{\\mathrm{max}}]$ .Let the distribution of $q$ in the population be $f(q)$ . Individuals have a choice. They can work for firms that do not distinguish among them and hence pay everyone the same amount. Or they can work for firms that incur an expense, denoted by $e$ , as a result of which the firm eventually learns the value of $q$ for the individual and pays the person accordingly. In equilibrium this cost, which is the same for everyone, is passed on to the individual in the form of a reduction in compensation. Labor markets are assumed to be competitive. For thoseindividualswhochoosethefirmswhere they are distinguished, the wage is $q-e$ If the individual chooses a firm that does not incur the cost and does not distinguish among workers, then the compensation is the average value of the individuals who work for that firm.  \n\n![](images/74cfbc5caa0c383cfd42c0f3b7fadbde6c52617d8eb6ec6c9305a6a3412674b3.jpg)  \nFIGURE 4.EQUILIBRIUMIN THE SEPARATING AND POOLINGMODEL  \n\nLet us suppose that the average value of the workers in the pooling firms is $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{q}}$ . If we consider the optimizing decisions of individuals, it is clear that if  \n\n$$\nq-e>\\bar{q}\n$$  \n\nthen the individual will choose to work for the separating firm and conversely. Let $q*=\\bar{q}+$ $e$ . In equilibrium, $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{q}}$ is the actual average value of those who work in the pooling firms, so that  \n\n$$\nq^{*}-e=\\frac{\\int_{q\\operatorname*{min}}^{q^{*}}q f(q)d q}{F(q^{*})}=E(q|q\\leq q^{*})\n$$  \n\nwhere $F(q)$ is the cumulative distribution function for the attribute $q$ . The equilibrium is illustrated in Figure 4.  \n\nThose with $q\\leq q^{*}$ receive $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{q}}$ and are pooled, while those with $q>q^{*}$ receive $q-e$ and are identified and are in the separating part of the equilibrium. It is possible that everyone will be pooled. This occurs when $e$ ,the costof discovery, is large enough that $q_{\\operatorname*{max}}-e$ is less than the unconditional mean of the whole distribution. Another view of the equilibrium is provided in Figure 5.  \n\n![](images/eb0ccca257ed4475d61c3ffb7d8be6a7e7cba096a6503bc1938bd8ffe7e44b84.jpg)  \nFIGURE5.ANALTERNATIVEVIEW OF THE EQUILIBRIUM  \n\nHere we plot the functions $q^{*}$ , and $E(q|q\\leq$ $q^{*})+e$ ，as a function of $q^{*}$ . The second function is upward sloping and will cross the 45-degree line, unless $e$ is large enough to keep the second function above the 45-degree line for all $q^{*}$ . The crossover point is the equilibrium level of $q^{*}$ .11  \n\nThe signal is the choice of which type of firm to go to and it is partially, but not completely, informative about the individual's value to the firm. I noted in the first model that the signal retains its informational content in equilibrium if the cost of the signal is negatively correlated with the (hard-to-observe) valued attribute. In this case, the cost of the signal is a constant across people but because of the subsequent discovery and adjustment, the net benefit to the individual of issuing the signal is positively correlated with the valued attribute.  \n\nIt is possible that the information carried by the signal increases efficiency. That circumstance increases the return to going into the separating side of the market and has the overall effect of increasing the size of the group that sends the signal. I should also note that it has been implicitly assumed here that the information about productivity, once it is acquired, is public. That would force the employer to pay the employee his or her productivity minus the discovery cost. If, on the other hand, the discovery is private, there will be a negotiation between the employer and the employee over the net income, and that will have the effect of lowering the net income of the employee relative to the case inwhich the information is public. Thus one should expect the size of the pooling component of the market equilibrium to rise when the discovery is private.  \n\n## IV. The General Continuous Model12  \n\nI would now like to establish some reasonably general properties of signaling models.13 Following that, we will look at improving the equilibrium performance of the market through taxes and subsidies, using the approach of optimal taxation with imperfect information. The variables are $n$ , standing for some attribute that is (a) not directly observable, and (b) valuable to employers, and ${\\mathfrak{y}}.$ ,which is years of education. The latter is observable and may be valuable to employers. The functions with need are $S(n,y)$ which specifies an individual's productivity or value to an employer as a function of education and $\\boldsymbol{n}$ , which I will henceforth refer to as ability. The remaining functions are $c(y,$ $n,$ 0，which specifies the cost of education as a function of the same two variables and $w(y)$ ， which is the wage offered to an individual who presents him or herself in the market with education of y. Since this is quite familiar territory, I will proceed fairly quickly. The equilibrium is defined by two conditions. First, given $w(y)$ ， individuals maximize income net of education costs with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{y}}$ . Thus they maximize $w(y)\\:-\\:c(y,n)$ by setting  \n\n$$\nw^{t}(y)=c_{y}(y,n).\n$$  \n\nThis holds for all $n$ . The second-order condition, $w^{t t}(y)-c_{y y}(y,n)<0$ , must hold. The second condition is that employers’ experience in the market over time must be consistent with the offers they are making, so that for all $n$  \n\n$$\nw(y)=s(n,y).\n$$  \n\nIgnore the second-order conditions for the moment. Since by assumption $s_{n}>0$ , one can in principle solve the equation above for $\\boldsymbol{n}$ in terms of $w$ and $\\boldsymbol{y}$ ,say, $\\pmb{n}=N(w,y)$ . Substituting in the first-order conditions, we have  \n\n$$\nw^{\\prime}(y)=c_{y}(y,N(w,y)).\n$$  \n\nThis is a first-order, ordinary differential equation. It has a one-parameter family of solutions that do not cross each other. In principle each member of this one-parameter family can be part of a market-signaling equilibrium.14  \n\nIf $c(0,n)=0$ for all $n$ and if $c_{y n}<0$ , then assuming $c_{y}>0$ ， $c(y,n)$ will be declining in $n$ and that combined with an upward-sloping $w(y)$ (without which no one would invest in education), ensures that $y$ is an increasing or at least a nondecreasing function of $\\boldsymbol{n}$ . Let the net income function be  \n\n$$\n{\\cal N}(y,n)=w(y)-c(y,n).\n$$  \n\nThis function has the property that $N_{y}$ is an increasing function of $n$ , which ensures that if $N_{y}=0$ for a particular value of $\\boldsymbol{n}$ , then if you raise $\\boldsymbol{n}$ ， $N_{y}$ will be greater than zero and the maximum will occur at a higher value of $y$  \n\nDifferentiating (1) with respect to $\\mathfrak{y}$ we have  \n\n$$\nw^{t t}-c_{y y}=c_{y n}\\frac{d n}{d y}<0\n$$  \n\nwhich means that the second-order condition is in fact satisfied.  \n\nWithout being too formal about it, education or any potential signal transmits information in equilibrium if its costs absolutely and at the margin decline as the unseen valued attribute increases. This is a sufficient condition. In a later section I will show by example that it is not a necessary condition.  \n\nSince for every level of $n$ ,in equilibrium $w(y)\\equiv s(n,y)$ , differentiating we have  \n\n$$\nw^{t}(y)=s_{y}+s_{n}\\frac{d n}{d y}>s_{y}\n$$  \n\nbecause $s_{n}>0$ and $d n/d y>0.$ This implies that in equilibrium, the private return to education is higher than its direct contribution to productivity, because of the second term in the equation above. This second term is the signaling effect. It is the part of the private return to the investment in education that is tied to the unobserved level of $n$ . Since $w^{t}=c_{y}$ , the above inequality implies that $s_{y}-c_{y}<0$ , so that in equilibrium for all $\\boldsymbol{n}$ , the investment in education is higher than it would be with perfect information. If $n$ were observable, then individuals would be paid $s(n,~y)$ ,and they would select education to maximize $s\\mathrm{~-~}c$ by setting $s_{y}=c_{y}$ . Note that if $s_{n}\\equiv0$ for all $_n$ , then the signaling effect goes away. The attribute $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is still unobservable to employers, but individuals make efficient education investment decisions as they have the information they need to make the investment decision optimally, and they are the only ones who need that information.  \n\nAs noted earlier, there is a one-parameter family of equilibrium wage schedules that do not cross.Let the parameter be $k$ and denotethe schedules by $w(y,k)$ .As the solutions do not cross,withoutloss ofgeneralitywe can assume that $w_{k}>0$ . Net income to the individual is $N=w-c$ . Differentiating partially  with respect to $k$ ，with $n$ held constant, we have  \n\n$$\nN_{k}=w_{k}+(w_{y}-c_{y})(\\partial{y}/\\partial{k})=w_{k}>0.\n$$  \n\nThus a shift from one equilibrium to another makes everyone better or worse off together. The equilibria are orderable by the Pareto criterion. What happens as one moves from one equilibrium to another is that the extent of overinvestment in the signal is increasing or declining for everyone. I have to confess that at the time, even after discovering that there might be multiple equilibria, I did not expect that there would be such a simple relationship among them in terms of market performance.  \n\n![](images/879ad409c1079fb7061632b676c8e64fe21da462f0541aed2c008962fac0e1ff.jpg)  \nFIGURE 6.A FAMILY OFEQUILIBRIUMWAGESCHEDULES  \n\nWe can use (2) above and the fact that $w\\equiv$ $s$ to derive the effect of a shift in the equilibrium on the levels of investment in education. $N=$ $w\\:-\\:c\\:=\\:s\\:-\\:c$ . Differentiating with respect to $k$ ,holding $_n$ constant, and using (2) we have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial k}=\\frac{w_{k}}{\\left(s_{y}-c_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)}<0.\n$$  \n\nFinally, from the equilibrium condition $w^{t}=$ $c_{y},$ .differentiating with respect to $k$ with $n$ fixed, wehave  \n\n$$\nw_{y k}=-\\left[\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial k}\\right](w_{y y}-c_{y y})<0.\n$$  \n\nThis gives us a pretty complete picture of what happens when the equilibrium wage schedule shifts up. It becomes fatter, inducing lower levels of investment in education. Average wages decline and average education costs decline more, so that net incomes rise and everyone is better off. Figure 6 represents the family of equilibrium wage schedules. As they rise, they become flatter and the range of investment in education shifts to the left. Figure 6 shows therange of investment in education for each of theschedules.Astheschedulesriseandbecome fatter, the ranges of investment in education move to the left, that is, they fall.  \n\nWhile it is perhaps interesting to note that the signaling effect causes overinvestment in the signal by the standard of a world in which there is perfect information, that is not the world we live in. Thus it may be more interesting to examine the equilibrium outcomes in comparison tovarious second-best outcomes that acknowledge that there is an informational gap and asymmetry that cannot simply be removed by a wave of the pen.  \n\nI will begin by looking at the maximization of total net income. Here as we shall see, one can achieve the efficient levels of investment in education for all $n$ . The required tax in effect undoes the signaling effect. The reason that this is a clean case is because a dollar of net income is of equal value regardless of the recipient; we do not get into the business of trading off income distribution against the objective of efficiency. Following this brief analysis, we will look at social welfare functions that are not linear in net income. For these, there will be a trade-off betweenefficiency and distribution. I will show that the market outcome is more akin to the outcome of maximizing a convex (that is to say antiegalitarian) social welfare function. This is not a surprising result since the function of signaling is to distinguish low- from high-productivity individuals, which results in a move away from egalitarian outcomes. I do also want to emphasize at the outset that the purpose of this analysis is not to propose or promote taxing or subsidizing signals but rather to help shed additional light on the properties of the competitive equilibrium.  \n\n### V. Maximizing Total Net Income  \n\nWe will assume that the unobservable attribute $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is distributed in the population according to  the  density function $f(n)$ ，andthe cumulative distribution will be represented by $F(n)$ . The total net income then is  \n\n$$\n\\int_{n}^{\\bar{n}}N(y,n)f(n)d n.\n$$  \n\nHere ${\\cal N}(y,n)=w(y)-c(y,n)$ as before. The constraints are two. Individuals choose rationally so that $w^{t}=c_{y}$ and total gross wages have to equal total productivity or value generated to employers:  \n\n$$\n\\int_{\\frac{n}{\\rho}}^{\\bar{n}}w(y)f(n)~d n=\\int_{\\frac{n}{\\rho}}^{\\bar{n}}s(y,n)f(n)~d n.\n$$  \n\nOur goal here is to select a schedule $w(y)$ that causes education choices $y(n)$ for each $n$ , that maximize total net income, net, that is, of education costs. This is actually pretty straightforward. Using (4), we can replace $w(y)$ in (3) and choose $y(n)$ to maximize  \n\n$$\n\\int_{\\frac{n}{2}}^{\\frac{n}{n}}(s(y,n)-c(y,n))f(n)d n.\n$$  \n\nThis is the simplest form of a calculus of variations problem.15 The solution is a schedule $y(n)$ that causes $s_{y}=c_{y}$ , for all levels of $n$ . The reader will note that the implied levels of investment in education are those which would occur if $n$ were observable, that is, in the hypothetical world of perfect information. They are therefore also the efficient levels of investment in education for each $n$ : education is invested in up to the point where at the margin its direct contribution to productivity (the human-capital effect) is equal to the marginal cost. That is to say,tomaximizenetincome,thewageschedule is set so as to remove the signaling effect, though education still carries the information and acts as a signaling. The private part of the return to the signal (which has to do with distinguishing one individual from another and hence falls into the zero-sum/redistribution aspect of the market mechanism) is simply removed by the optimal tax or wage schedule. To find the required wage schedule, you invert the optimal schedule $y(n)$ to $r(y)$ , substitute that in the optimizing condition $w^{t}(y)=c_{y}(y,r(y))$ and integrate to get  \n\n$$\nw(y)=w(0)+\\int_{0}^{y}c_{y}(v,r(v))d v.\n$$  \n\nTheparameter $w(0)$ is then set to cause the breakeven condition (4) to be met. Individuals are likely being paid their productivity in the marketplace, $s(y,r(y))$ . Therefore one can get to the desired result by imposing a tax/subsidy on education of $t(y)=s(y,r(y))-w(y).$ where $w(y)$ is defined by (5) above. If you differentiate $t(y)$ with respect to $y$ you have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{t^{\\prime}(y)=s_{\\mathrm{y}}+s_{n}r^{t}-w^{t}}\\ {=s_{\\mathrm{y}}-c_{\\mathrm{y}}+s_{n}r^{t}=s_{n}r^{t}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe last term in the equation is the signaling effect at the margin of a change in education. This then says that the optimal tax at the margin is equal to the signaling effect. It takes that part of the private return to education away, leaving only the human-capital effect or the direct contribution to productivity.  \n\nOne can also achieve the same result with an income tax. Let income be $I.$ Its relation to education is given by $I=s(y,r(y))$ . Invert that function to get $y=Y(I)$ and then set the income tax $T(I)$ equal to $I\\mathrm{~-~}w(Y(I))$ ,where again $w(y)$ is defined by (5). Individuals will select income so as to maximize $I\\:-\\:T(I)\\:-\\:$ $c(Y(I),n)=w(Y(I)-c(Y(I),n)$ ,by setting $w^{t}=c_{y}$ which is the desired result.16°  \n\nIt is interesting for those of us who live in the United States that to a first crude approximation, our education costs are roughly similar in form to the efficiency-inducing tax schedule. Lower levels of education are subsidized and these subsidies decline at college and university levels because of the existence of a large private sector in higher education.  \n\n### V1. Second-Best Optima with Asymmetric Information  \n\nWe turn now to a brief examination of the effects of investment in education and on net incomes of maximizing some social welfare function. As before, $N=w(y)-c(y,n)$ is net income and $n$ is distributed in the population according to $f(n)$ . Let $V(N)$ be the social value of net income of $N$ to any individual. For the moment, we will place no restrictions on $V(N)$  \n\nother than that it is upward sloping-—more net income is better. We will adopt an additive social welfare function:  \n\n$$\nZ=\\int_{n}^{\\bar{n}}V(N(n))f(n)~d n.\n$$  \n\nFor the moment, we will make no assumptions about the shape of $V(N)$ except that it is upward sloping. The objective is to maximize $Z$ subject to two constraints. One is that individuals make a rational choice of education  \n\n$$\nw^{t}(y)=c_{y}(y,n).\n$$  \n\nThe second constraint is that gross wages add up to total output or productivity:  \n\n$$\n\\int_{n}^{\\bar{n}}(w-s)f(n)d n=0.\n$$  \n\nLet us suppose that the particular function $w(y)$ that is chosen induces a choice of $y=r(n)$ foreach level of the unobserved characteristic. Differentiating $N(y,n)$ totally with respect to $n$ gives  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d N}{d n}}=(w^{t}-c_{\\mathrm{y}})r^{t}-c_{n}=-c_{n}>0.\n$$  \n\nLet $N(\\underset{-}{n})=K$ . Integrating (7) with respect to $n$ we have  \n\n$$\nN(n)=K-\\int_{\\frac{n}{2}}^{n}c_{n}(r(u),u)d u.\n$$  \n\nNoting that $w=N+c$ , and substituting in (6) the condition that total wages equal total productivity across the whole population, we have  \n\n$$\nK=\\int_{n}^{\\tilde{n}}\\left[s-c+\\int_{\\frac{n}{2}}^{n}c_{n}(r(u),u)d u\\right]f(n)d n.\n$$  \n\nThe point of all this is simply to get rid of the function $w(y)$ . Thus we imagine selecting an upward-sloping function $y=r(n)$ to maximize Z. By using (8) and (9) we are assured that both constraints in the problem are satisfied, and the wage or tax schedule is nowhere in sight. We can calculate it later using the optimal schedule $r(n)$ by inverting that schedule to $\\mathit{n}=\\mathit{h}(\\mathit{y})$ ， substituting for $\\boldsymbol{n}$ in $w^{t}=c_{y}$ and integrating to get the $w(y)$ that induce the signal choices that solve the optimizing problem.  \n\nThe solution to the problem is:17  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\lefteqn{s_{y}-c_{y})f}}\\ &{}&{=c_{y n}\\times\\left[F(n)-1+\\frac{\\displaystyle\\int_{n}^{\\bar{n}}V f d u}{\\displaystyle\\int_{n}^{\\bar{n}}V f d u}\\right].}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIf $V^{t}(N)$ is a constant so that $V(N)$ is linear, then the right side of (10) is zero. This is the case we have just looked at, where total net income is maximized by inducing the efficient choices of investment in education. It is just a special case of the more general problem and in that case, the optimal schedule is defined by $\\begin{array}{r}{s_{y}=c_{y},}\\end{array}$ for all $n$  \n\nIf $V(N)$ is very concave so that the first derivative falls rapidly, then at the limit the only thing that matters is the net income of the people with the lowest net income. This case is normally called the maximin case. In this case (10)becomes  \n\n$$\n(s_{y}-c_{y})f=-c_{y n}(1-F).\n$$  \n\nThe right side of (11) is positive, which means that investment in education is below the efficient and full information level. At the top of the range of $n$ $(1~-~F)/f$ approaches zero and the investment in education is efficient.18  \n\nThe maximin outcome in terms of investment in the signal is also the result that would obtain if there were a monopsonist purchaser of labor services. The reason is that the monopsonist wants to maximize the difference between productivity and gross wages, subject to the constraint that the net income of the individuals with the lowest net income not fall below some prespecified level. Thus the solution to the monopsonist's problem is to maximize the net income of the lowest level and then take it all awaybylowering $w(y)$ uniformly across all education levels. Mathematically you are just reversing the objective function and one of the constraints.  \n\nThe opposite extreme occurs when the welfare function is extremely convex so that its slope rises rapidly. In the limit that would mean valuing only the net incomes of those with the highest net incomes,the maximax case. In this case, the optimizing condition (10) becomes  \n\n$$\n(s_{y}-c_{y})f=c_{y n}F.\n$$  \n\nIn this case, the right side of (12) is negative, implying that like the market equilibrium with imperfect information, the investment in education goes beyond the point at which the direction contribution to productivity is reached. At the bottom end of the range of $n$ ,Flfapproaches O and thus at the lowest levels the investment in education is efficient.19  \n\nFor the cases where $\\boldsymbol{\\upsilon}(N)$ is not approaching an extreme (very convex or concave), one can see from (10) that the right side approaches zero when $n$ approaches its minimum and its maximum values. Provided that $f(n)$ does not go to zero at the extremes, this would mean that at the end values of $n$ ，investment in education is efficient, that is $s_{y}-c_{y}=0$ . This is generally not a feature of the competitive equilibrium, and thus we may conclude that the competitive equilibrium is generally not the solution to some optimizing problem with this form of social welfare function. It is possible to rewrite the optimizing condition (10) in the following form:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{(s_{y}-c_{y})f=-c_{y n}[1-F]}\\ {\\qquad\\quad\\times\\left[1-\\displaystyle\\frac{E(V^{t}|u>n)}{E(V^{t})}\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $E(^{*}|-)$ is  the  conditional  expected value. For concave functions the term in the large square brackets on the right is always positive and thus investment in education is below the efficient level for all $n$ except possibly at the end points. For convex welfare functions, the derivative is rising and thus the term in square brackets is negative. The levels of investment in education exceed the efficient ones.20  \n\nIf you stand back from all this, the general pattern is fairly clear. The market equilibrium produces overinvestment in the signal because of the signaling effect, which is a private benefit to the investor, but yields no social benefit as its function is purely redistributive. The redistribution occurs in the direction of increasing the gross and net incomes of those with higher levels of education and productivity and hence income, the market equilibria tend to look more like the solutions to a second-best optimizing problem with a convex social welfare function. These, not surprisingly, are the welfare functions that weight higher net incomes more highly than lower net incomes.  \n\n### VIl. The Case of Education Costs Rising with the Unseen Attribute: Signaling Costs Vary the Wrong Way with Respect to Productivity  \n\nThe standard case of signaling in which the signal has the capacity to survive and retain its informational content occurs when there is an unobservable attribute that is valuable to buyers (in the examples we are looking at, employers) and the costs of undertaking some activity that is observable are negatively correlated with the valued attribute. The labor-market examples, however, are slightly more complicated in that the unobserved attribute contributes to the individual's productivity and so does the signal. Thus, whatever the unobservable attribute is, it has two sources of value. One is the direct effect on productivity and the other is that lowering the costs of acquiring human capital also has value. Up to this point we have assumed that all of this works in the same direction. But it is possible that attributes that lower the cost of acquiring education might not be those that enhance productivity or might even be attributes that have a negative effect on productivity. We know that if $S_{n}=0$ , then you can get a signaling equilibrium, though in that case the signal is not needed: it simply identifies ex post those with lower education costs and hence higher levels of education.  \n\nThe question I pose now is: can you get a signaling equilibrium when $c_{y n}>0$ , assuming that $s_{n}>0?$ From the analysis of equilibria, we know that the second-order condition for the individual's choice of education is satisfied only if $w^{t t}-c_{y y}=c_{y n}d n/d y<0\\$ This means that if $c_{y n}>0$ one can have an equilibrium with signaling only if $d n/d y<0$ So the question is: can that happen? The only way it could happen is if the human-capital effect is large in the sense that it overrides the negative signaling effect. Thus if $s_{y}\\equiv0$ , it certainly cannot happen. The signal makes no direct contribution to productivity and sends the wrong message about the unobserved attribute. Everyone will set $y=0$ . But the answer to the question posed above is: yes, provided that the human-capital effect is large enough to override the negative signaling effect. There can be signaling equilibria in which signaling costs rise with the level of the unobserved attribute that contributes to productivity. I will demonstrate this by example in a moment. Intuitively this should make sense if the human-capital effect is big enough, because thentheattributethatisofrealvaluetothe individual and to the employer is the one that drives education costs down. The key is that the wage schedule has to be upward sloping in the signal, and this can happen if $s_{y}$ is big enough evenif $s_{n}~<~0$ .In this context, the correct statement about the condition that allows for a signaling equilibrium is that the net benefit of acquiring the signal has to be positively correlated with the gross effect on productivity. This could happen in segments of the population if very talented people face high opportunity costs associated with spending time on education.  \n\nThis case may or may not be interesting from an empirical point of view, but it does illustrate that the more general formulation of the conditions for signaling are in terms of gross and net benefits and not just signaling costs. I did not realize this when I first worked on signaling equilibria. I thought then that the absence of the intuitively plausible negative cost correlation condition would destroy a signaling equilibrium. It is also of potential interest because the signaling effect is reversed. If $c_{y n}>0$ , then in equilibrium if there is signaling, $d n/d y<0$ and thus  \n\n$$\nw^{t}=s_{y}+s_{n}{\\frac{d n}{d y}}<s_{y}.\n$$  \n\nTherefore the negative signaling effect causes the private return to education to fall short of the social return and hence causes underinvestment in education.21 It remains to show by a constructive example that this can happen at least in the theory, and perhaps also in the world.  \n\nWe will show that this can happen with an example. Let $s(n,y)=n y^{\\theta}$ , and let $c(y,n)=$ $n^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}$ ，where $\\alpha<1$ . Following the standard equilibrium analysis, we have  \n\n$$\nw^{t}=c_{y}=\\beta n^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta-1}.\n$$  \n\nIn addition $w=n{y}^{\\theta}$ or $n=w y^{-\\theta}$ . Substitut  \n\ning in (13), we have the differential equation in $w(y)$ that defines the equilibrium wage schedules:  \n\n$$\nw^{-\\alpha}w^{t}=\\beta y^{(\\beta-1-\\alpha\\theta)}.\n$$  \n\nOne of the solutions to this differential equation is:22  \n\n$$\nw(y)=K y^{(\\beta-\\alpha\\theta)/(1-\\alpha)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $K$ is a constant. If you then proceed to determine equilibrium choices of education, they are given by  \n\n$$\ny(n)=T n^{(1-\\alpha)/(\\beta-\\theta)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $T$ is another constant. The second-order condition is satisfied and this all works if $d y/$ $d n<0$ and this will in fact be the case provided that $\\alpha<1$ ,and $\\beta<\\theta$ That is to say, signaling occurs and there is a separating equilibrium, if the elasticity of productivity with respect to education is larger than the elasticity of education costs with respect to education. Or in simple ordinary language, education is productive enough to justify its costs and override the negativesignalingeffect.  \n\nAnother way to think about these relationships and this case is to change the unobserved variable from $\\boldsymbol{n}$ to $\\mathbf{\\Delta}t=\\bar{\\mathbf{n}}-\\mathbf{\\Delta}n$ ，where $\\bar{n}$ is the highest level of $\\mathbf{\\nabla}n$ .In effect this defines the unobserved characteristic to be that which lowers education costs. Now investment in education will rise with $t_{:}$ provided there is a separating equilibrium, because $c_{y t}<0$ .But the effect of $t$ on productivity is now negative, and if that effect is strong enough relative to the human-capital effect, then that will prevent a separating version of the signaling equilibrium. The reason is that unless the human-capital effect is large enough, the signaling effect will cause the wage function to be downward sloping in y. There will be a pooling equilibrium at ${\\boldsymbol y}=0$ and that of course entails in the hypothetical example, reasonably dramatic underinvestment in the potential signal even though it is productive human capital.  \n\n22 As this is simply a illustraive example, the is not much point in studying all the equilibria in the example.  \n\n### VII. The Information Contained in the Signal Can Improve Productivity  \n\nIt should be noted that the information carried by the signal can be productive itself. This will occur if there is a decision that is made better or with greater efficiency, with better information. In the job market context, one could build this in as follows. Let productivity be $v(n,~y,~d)$ where $^{d}$ is a decision that the employer makes. It could be a decision about what type of job to assign to someone or a decision about required training. One can interpret the preceding analysis then, at least for equilibria in which the signal carries information in equilibrium, as $s(n,y)$ being the maximum of $v(n,y,d)$ with respect to $^d$ for each level of $n$ and $y$ . Note that this component of value is different from the human-capital effect. Unlike the human-capital effect, this element of value only exists if the signal is carrying information in equilibrium. You would lose it in a partial or complete pooling equilibrium even if that equilibrium included investment in education.  \n\nIn situations like the Lazear model that we examined earlier, in which there is both pooling and separating components of the equilibrium, the addition of a decision that is made better with information will cause the value of the signal to rise, or more accurately the net benefits to rise. Those net benefits are passed on to individuals by virtue of competition on the employer side. Thus the relative sizes of the separating and pooling components of the equilibrium will shift in favor of the separating part. More people will opt to go to the firms that incur the expense of monitoring and learning productivity over time.  \n\n### IX. Time and the Allocation of Time as a Signal and a Screening Device23  \n\nThe principles that govern the survival of signals in markets can be applied to other contexts. The kind of mixed or imperfectly aligned incentive structure that characterizesmarkets is common in many situations. In particular, situations in which individuals have an unknown or imperfectly perceived level of interest in someone or something are ubiquitous. In these situations, one frequently observes that time spent by the individual is taken as a signal of interest. Literature and everyday experience suggest that the allocation of time is a ubiquitous and persistent signal sometimes used deliberately as a screening device.  \n\nThe persistence of spending time as a signal of interest in something is a reflection of the fact that time is in short supply and everyone knows it. There is a nonzero shadow price on time, and hence the use of it in pursuit of some person, goal, or interest must mean that some implicit net benefit test has been passed for those who spent the time and failed for others who did not.  \n\nThe use and interpretation of time as a signal is complicated and enriched by the accurate observation that there are both perceived and actual differences across people in the shadow price on time. These differences are used to interpret the signal. The allocation of a small amount of time by an individual with a high perceived shadow price on time has the same weight as a larger allocation of time by an individual with a lower perceived shadow price. As an example, those who have had visible leadership positions in virtually any organization know that the events they attend are taken as signals of interest and support and, conversely, when they do not show up, they deliberately and sometimes inadvertently signal a lack of interest, support, or enthusiasm. It is noteworthy that the informational content of these common signals is not necessarily related to whether the individual (the signaler) is actually needed or has a role at the event. In fact, having a role at the event can dilute the signal because it complicates the interpretation of the reason for the leader's presence.  \n\nTime is also routinely used as a screening device or as part of the price of admission to events at which the number of places is in short supply.For entertainment and sporting events it is common to find that a mixed system that involves both price and time is used to allocate the limited number of places at the event. The question that I address briefy in this section is why the mixed system would be used in preference to the pure price system. The intuitive answer is that willingness or ability to pay may be a poor signal of real interest in the event, not withstanding the fact that failure to use the price system is inefficient for two reasons.24 The mixed system allocates places or access to those who would (and often do, if there is a secondary market) sell the place to someone with a higher willingness to pay---when that happens both parties are better off. Second, the time that is used to acquire the places is a deadweight loss under most circumstances. Notwithstanding the clear problems with the failure to use the price system, the use of the mixed system is very common and must mean that some objective is being pursued that is not respectful of the current distribution of income. For if the distribution of income is viewed as optimal, it is hard to conjure up a rationale for incurring the costs of the mixed systemmentioned above.  \n\nI am going to use a simple example to look at the effects of using a mixed system for this class of resource allocation problems. It is not meant to be a general model, but rather to suggest what parameters  are important in determining  the performance characteristics of the outcome.  \n\nLet the value attached to an event by an individual be 0. One can think of this as a dollar valuation based on a roughly equal distribution of income, or one can think of it as a measure of value in a pure time system. What it is not is a current willingness to pay for access to the event. It is uniformly distributed in the population, on the interval [0, 1]. The value of money is $\\lambda$ It also is distributed uniformly in the population on the interval [o, 1]. The assumption about the value of time at the margin is that it is equal to $G\\mathrm{~-~}a\\lambda$ . If the parameter $^a$ is zero, then it is a constant, if $a>0$ , then the marginal value of time is negatively correlated with the marginal value of income, and the converse is also true. The fraction of the population that can have access to the even is $N$ ，and we will assume that $N<0.5$ . Finally let $p$ be the monetary price for access to the event and let $T$ be the time price.  \n\nThe set of people who attend the event is the people with combinations of $(\\theta,\\lambda)$ that satisfy the inequality  \n\n![](images/9b44e43c7842a75f2eb73c7866afe4e4677f8b5c84cff2d28f1acb09b0141cb0.jpg)  \nFIGURE 7.

Then because of the fixed supply, the area of the region associated with $A$ hastobe $N$  \n\nFigure 7 is useful in analyzing the choices. Each of the lines inside the unit square represent combinations of $R$ and $s$ ，so that the area above the line is $N$ . The line through the origin represents the pure price system. As the time price $T$ is raised, $s$ rises and $R$ falls. It is easy to see without a complicated proof that as $T$ rises, the average value of $\\pmb{\\theta}$ is rising while the total numbers stay the same, so that the total gross value to consumers is rising. This continues until the line goes fat, at which point $R\\:=\\:0$ .It is also clear that the increases are largest for low levels of $T$ or $s$ because initially one is trading low levels of $\\theta$ for much higher levels.  \n\nIt is possible that the mixed time and price system is commonly used simply to achieve this result, namely allocating the spots to those who attach the highest value to them, and that whoever makes these decisions does not think about or care about the deadweight cost of the time component of the price. But perhaps a more interesting question is whether the use of the mixed system ever increases the net benefits. Wewill assume that the dollar revenue is distributed in a neutral way so that the price component of the access charge generates neither net benefits or costs. The time component of the access charge however generates a deadweight cost.  \n\nThe net benefits are  \n\n$$\nZ=\\int_{\\cal A}\\theta-S N+\\frac{a S}{G}\\int_{A}\\lambda.\n$$  \n\nThe second two terms are the deadweight cost of the time component of the access charge. We have already observed that the first term, the gross benefits, are a rising function of $S=G T,$ reflecting the use of time as part of the allocation mechanism. This is true independent of the sign or size of the parameter $^{\\leftarrow}a$ \" Moreover, one can see from Figure 7 that starting at $S=0$ ,the gains from increasing S, or $T$ . are largest at the start (that is near $S=0$ )because as the lines rise and rotate right, low average levels of the valuation parameter $\\theta$ are being knocked out and high ones are being brought in. The difference between the exits and the entries steadily declines as $s$ increases, and the lines become flatter.  \n\nThis brings us to the question of whether the netbenefits alsoincrease atleast over some rangeas $s$ increases. It is somewhat tedious but not difficult to show that in this example that the slope of gross benefits at $s=0$ is  \n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d}{d S}\\right|_{A}\\theta\\left|_{\\displaystyle{s=0}}=\\frac{1}{3}N.\n$$  \n\nThe derivative of net benefits at $s=0$ is25  \n\n25 These results follow from the following facts. For $R+S>1$ $R=(1-S)^{2}/2N$ gross benefits are $(1/R)[(1/3)\\times$ $(1-S^{3})-(S/2)(1-S^{2})],$ and the deadweight time cost is $(2/3)N^{2}[a S/G(1~-~S)]~-~S N$ .Similarly, when $R+S<1$ which occurs as $s$ becomes larger, $R=2(1-S-N)$ gross benefits are $(1/2)[(1-S^{2})-R\\bar{S}-(R^{2}/3)]$ andthedeadweight costof theuseoftimeis $[(1-s)/2]-R/3$ When $R+S=1$ the line that separates thosewho are admitted from those who  \n\n![](images/9af01e85a9be7c303e0f4102ed929bffb115a551f1743147de3d41f272c1fe80.jpg)  \nFIGURE 8.NET BENEFITS AS A FUNCTION OF THE USE OF TIME  \n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d Z}{d S}\\right|_{S=0}=\\frac{2}{3}N\\Biggl[N\\frac{a}{G}-1\\Biggr].\n$$  \n\nIf the parameter $^{a}$ is zero, then one can see that in this example, the deadweight costs outweigh the gain in gross benefits. However if $\\mathbf{\\omega}^{\\leftrightarrow}\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_{a}\\mathbf{\\gamma},$ is positive and large enough, then the net benefits rise at least over some range. Why should this occur intuitively? Here price is a badly flawed signal of value. Time, if its marginal cost is uncorrelated with price, is a better signal of value, but not good enough to overcome the deadweight cost. But if the marginal cost of time is negatively related to the marginal value of income, then the combination of price and time is a much better signal of value. And if marginal time costs fall quite rapidly as the marginal value of income increases, then the cost of the time that is needed to screen out the high-income-low-value purchasers is relatively low.  \n\nTo illustrate, Figure 8 shows the value of net benefits as a function of $s$ ,for a case in which $G=2$ ， $N=0.25$ and $a=14$ . Here the reader should ignore the higher levels of $s$ , as they are associated with negative prices. Above a certain level of $s$ , or time cost, the model starts redistributing income, which is counter to the spirit of the analysis.26  \n\nare not goes through the point $(1,1)$ whichiswhytheformulae shift at that point.  \n\n26 The existence o secondary market wil to some extent reducethebenefitofthemixedsystembecauseitwilldraw into theprimary allocation system entrepreneurswho are theretousetheirrelativelylowvaluation ontimetomake  \n\nTo summarize, while this simple example hardly disposes of the issue of how markets go about trying to solve complex allocation problems in a world of imperfect information, it does, I hope, suggest that the kinds of mixed systems that we observe in reality may be quite innovative solutions tothese problems and probably should not be dismissed in all cases as mistakes made by people who do not understand the virtues of the price system. There may even be more interesting and less wasteful alternative currencies, such as hours spent in public service work, that could be used in conjunction with the price system to allocate highly valued access to important events. While such alternatives might not be as effective as time in undoing the effect of the price system, they may also have considerably less deadweight cost associated with them.  \n\n## X. The Internet and the Changing Informational Structure of Markets  \n\nThe proposition that the Internet (or more accurately, its relatively recent accessibility to a broad spectrum of users) has changed the informational structure of many markets, industries, and economies is probably not controversial. One could argue about how rapid the change has been from quite sudden on the one hand to a gradual evolution from the telegraph (which was the first time that communication over distance did not require the physical movement of something and hence became, in a certain sense, nearly instantaneous) through radio, the telephone, television, fax, etc., on the other. It has also been easy for some to dismiss all of this as a fad, relying on the boom-and-bust cycle that we have just observed. But in my judgment that would be a mistake. We know from the economics of information that there are periods in which enough has changed so that we operate in a data-free environment, that is, one in which there is temporarily little or no relevant data to constrain expectation. The data trickle in and the beliefs and expectations start to line up with reality again.  \n\nThe more fundamental point is that investors and others were probably not wrong about the ultimate effect of this technology on markets and the economy, but almost everyone overestimated the speed with which individuals and organizations change their behavior, and we also underestimated the amount of difficult technical infrastructure that needed to be built in order to have the foreseen outcomes become a reality. We would undoubtedly have been better off if we had reminded ourselves of the important work of the late Zvi Griliches (1977) on the diffusion of innovation, as that would have caused some questioning of the assumption that what very intelligent people can foresee will come about quickly. I wanted also to recognize Zvi's work as an early and very important example of behavioral economics.  \n\nNevertheless, there are powerful forces driving the outcomes and changing the informational structure of markets. Three of the most important are Moore's law, Metcalfe's law, and the dramatic reduction of the noise to signal ration in fiber-optic cable resulting in very large expansions in the throughput capacity of these pipes measured in signal processing terms. Moore's law is well known. It is an empirical observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months to 24 months. To a first approximation this has produced roughly a 10-billion-times cost reduction in the first 50 years of the computer age, dated from about 1950. Or to put it another way, things that were imaginable but unimaginably expensive in 1950 are essentially costless today. Economic historians will be better able than I to say whether there were comparable periods of change in the past with respect to costs of doing something important.  \n\nMetcalfe's law states that the value of a network to the entities attached to it is proportional to the square of the number of connected entities.27 In economic terms this probably means that the value and hence the speed of connecting accelerates as the numbers increase. This is sometimesreferred to as the network effect.  \n\nFrom signal processing theory we know that the capacity of a channel is proportional to the log of one plus the ratio of signal to noise. Through scientific and technical advances (in addition to being able to use lasers with multiple wavelengths), the noise generated when the light reflects off the side of the fiber-optic cable is being reduced dramatically, causing very large increases in data rates on existing fiber. In economic terms this translates into large cost reductions in providing bandwidth.  \n\nThesethreeeffectsinteractwitheachother over time to produce accelerating economic effects. Much of the recent economic impact of the Internet is associated with reducing transaction costs of a variety of kinds. I will return to this subject in a moment. For most of these effects, one needs not just computing power, but also a reasonably ubiquitous reliable network that has standardized protocols, and is more or less always on. After all, transactions involve, almost by definition, more than one party, though increasingly one or more of the parties are machines. It is interesting and not surprising, therefore, that for the first 40 years of the proliferation of computers, not much measurableproductivityincrease was detectablein macroeconomic data. In the past ten years, the period in which the expansion of the network occurred, there are noticeable measurable productivity gains. It seems very likely that the productivity gains (the ones we can detect) are associated with reduced transaction costs, improved performance of markets, the ability to create new markets that were too expensive to create without the technology, and the important ability to take time and cost out of the coordination of economic activity, inside the firm and in the supply or value-added chain. That is what the network, with high and reliable capacity, with growing numbers connected to it and with enough computing power to run the endpoints and the nodes has permitted. It is a cumulative effect that we are just beginning to see.  \n\nBuilding models in economics is an art and a science. The science part consists of determining analytically the consequences of the assumption that create the structure of the model. The art consists in deciding what to put into the structure and what to leave out. Putting in too much makes the models intractable and of little use in illuminating the determinants of market performance. Putting in either too little or the wrong structural features makes the results, though tractable, uninteresting. A natural consequence of this is that parameters that do not change much from market to market or over time tend to be suppressed, as a matter of good practice in applied microeconomic theory. 1 mention all of this because it is possible and even likely that some parameters related to search costs, transaction costs, acquiring information, and geography have shifted reasonably rapidly in the past few years (or are in the process of shifting) as a result of the increasing speed, ubiquity, and connectivity of the Internet. This potential shift in parameters creates the opportunity to revisit aspects of the informational structure of markets and organizations, and in a sense, reintroduce the suppressed parameters as they have become interesting again. I would like to conclude this essay by suggesting a few areas in which such an inquiry might yield some interesting results.  \n\nOne might have the impression from a first courseineconomictheorythatmarketscombine supply and demand curves to produce prices, quantities, and to determine who buys the good. There is nothing wrong with that view. But in addition, a market economy performs lots of other functions. Potential buyers and sellers need to find each other. Often buyers and sellers need to acquire information about each other and about the product. If the buyers, sellers, and products are differentiated, then there is a matching problem that in one form or another needs to be resolved in the marketplace. If sellers are charging different prices, then buyers need to consider engaging in some sort of reasonable search for the lower prices. These functions are not performed costlessly, and the costs of performing them are frequently lumped together under the heading of transaction costs. Broadly these costs are being changed and lowered by the Internet.  \n\n### XI. Buyers and Sellers Finding Each Other  \n\nProbably the most obvious example of reduced transaction costs is that associated with the rapid expansion of the markets for collectibles and used products of all kinds. In this arena the overwhelmingly largest market making entity is eBay. There are on average 750,000 transactions on each day with an average total daily dollar volume of 30 million.28 Most of these markets simply did not exist previously, and those that did exist were more costly to create, less efficient, and less liquid. It is worth noting that the drop in the cost of buyers and sellers finding each other is largely independent of physical geography (recall that both distance and time are simultaneously compressed with the Internet technology). This partial removal of the geographic bounds of markets makes them more liquid and in a certain sense more competitive. However, there are elements of natural monopoly in the market-making function.As the number of bidders increases, the expected winning bid rises in these auctions. Hence the marketplace that is in the lead will attract the sellers, and the variety of products will attract the buyers.29 Figure 9 shows the relationship between the number of bidders and the expected selling price in an ordinary auction.  \n\n![](images/37aa3c4136da772cffd77ae5d6443b2fbd8cfb0bb1f62c88b8ce698b379d1a71.jpg)  \nExpected winning bid   \nFIGURE 9. THE LIQUIDITY EFFECT IN AUCTION MARKETS  \n\n28 Figure are from Jeff Skoll cofounder of eBay. There are of course more markets open in any given day than there aretransactions.  \n\n29 There is a potential qualification to this tendency. Intelligent software agents are in principle capable of searching for low prices across marketplaces. If individuals were prepared to use these agents,that would eliminate the liquidity advantage of the larger market-makers. However, this does not appear to have happened, at least not to the extent that it significantly diminishes eBay's advantage. The making of online markets is pretty clearly a potential area forresearch.  \n\n### XIl. Searching for the Lowest Price  \n\nThe late George J. Stigler recognized that finding the lowest price was an activity that requiredresources and that there was a trade-off between incurring costs of further search and the expected benefits of finding even lower prices. For prices that are posted in an Internet environment, the cost of finding the lowest price is pretty close to zero. In principle, this should eliminate price dispersion by eliminating one sideof thetrade-off.Therewas akindofnatural partial protection from price competition, the magnitude of which is a function of the search costs. The reduction or elimination of these search costs in the first instance increases competition. However, there is probably more to this story. The decision to post a price is a strategic decision and in the face of negligible search costs, it is possible that sellers’ willingness to post prices will decline and that there will be more negotiated prices or prices that are tailored to the individual buyer.  \n\n### XIII. The Boundaries of the Firm  \n\nThere is a well-known and important literatureineconomicsassociatedwithRonaldH. Coase (1937, 1960) and Oliver E. Williamson (1970, 1971) and others. It deals in part with the fundamental question of what economic processes are contained within a firm and which are mediated by markets, that is, transaction between firms. One aspect of this general set of questions has to do with outsourcing: the decision to conduct a certain set of activities inhouse or to contract with another entity tohave them conducted for the firm. Generally on the side of outsourcing is the likelihood that certain functions can be performed better by specialists who have the advantages of economies of focus and scale. Countering that are the contracting, monitoring, and implementation costs of having a second party provide the service.Some of these countervailing costs are just transaction costs associated with complexity in communication. It is becoming reasonably clear that the Internet platform is reducing some of these transaction costs and hence tipping the balance in a number of areas in the direction of outsourcing. Many, if not most, informationally based services are efficiently deliverable and monitorable on the platform.  \n\nWe have in a sense, for the period of transition, a natural laboratory in which transaction cost parameters are being shifted, resulting in new experimental behavior on the part of firms. In general, the range of economic activity that can be effectively coordinated across a complex multifirm supply chain is just starting to be explored by companies and those who do research on these subjects. The boundaries of the firm, transaction costs, supply-chain architecture and coordination, and outsourcing are all facets of a large mosaic in which incentives, communication and coordination, and the boundaries of the firm are worked out. The outsourcing extends to the employment relationship, where again the relative costs of inhouse and the outsourced resources may have shifted. I hasten to add that these issues are far from being settled in the world of practice and in the world of economic research.  \n\n# REFERENCES30  \n\nAkerlof, George A. “The Market for ‘Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism.\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, August 1970, 84(3), Pp. 488-500. “The Economics of Caste and of the Rat Race and Other Woeful Tales.\"' Quarterly Journal of Economics, November 1976, 90(4), Pp. 599-617. . “Labor Contracts as Partial Gift Exchange.\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, November 1982, 97(4), pp. 543-69. . \"Gift Exchange and Efficiency-Wage Theory: Four Views.\" American Economic Review, May 1984 (Papers and Proceedings), 74(2), Pp. 79-83.   \nAlchian, Armen A. and Demsetz, Harold. “Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization.\" American Economic Review, December 1972, 62(5), pp. 777-95.   \nArnott, Richard J. and Stiglitz, Joseph E. “Moral Hazard and Nonmarket Institutions: Dysfunctional Crowding Out or Peer Monitoring?

Introduction  \n\nEconomists have long examined the determinants of firms? innovation because characteristics of innovative firms can have significant implications not only for firms’ success, but also for the economic development and growth of a country. As greater innovation increases the future scientific and technological resources of a country, and improves the standards of living, identifying the key factors that foster innovation is important.  \n\nThe literature on the Schumpeterian hypotheses (e.g., Audretsch and Acs, 1991) argues that larger firms operating in concentrated markets are the main engine of technological progress. This literature has offered numerous insights as to how firm size and market structure affect firm innovation. Nonetheless, there is no consensus on the effects of firm size and market structure on firm innovation (e.g., Symeonidis, 1996). In contrast to much of the economics literature, the management literature has focused on internal factors and examined firm innovation capability using the theory of knowledge (Tamer et al., 2003; Lin, 2007). In those studies, one of the challenges is how to measure important variables involved, such as the extent of tacit knowledge transfer. A common practice is to use questionnaires and ask related employees in a firm to answer it. It is not hard to understand that complex issues arise in the design of questionnaires and the subjectiveness of the answers, not to mention that the conclusions from those studies can be very specific and hard to generalize in other contexts.  \n\nTraditionally, the most important factor explaining innovation has been R&D spending.? More specifically, the focus has been on the productivity of R&D, and thus didn't take non-R&D innovation factors into account, which is often an important composition of firm innovation, especially in developing countries. There are three types of creative  \n\nactivities that do not require R&D. First, Kim and Nelson (2000) found that imitative activities, including reverse engineering, often require very little R&D, and the imitation is mainly dependent on the firm's technical personnel and engineers. Second, firms can make incremental changes to products and processes, relying on engineering human capital. Moreover, Hansen and Serin (1997) note that the innovation process in low-and mediumtechnology sectors is more related to adaptation and learning-by-doing, based on design and process optimization, rather than from R&D.6 Third, firms can combine existing knowledge in new ways, for example in industrial design and engineering projects (Grimpe and Sofka, 2009). Due to the large share of firms that innovate without much R&D, one can conclude that studies that only focus on R&D may not provide a full picture of differences in innovation across firms.  \n\nVarious studies have examined the effects of external factors on firm innovation. For example, Audretsch and Feldman (2004) noted that location and geography are important in explaining the determinants of innovation, and they identified knowledge spillovers as the main mechanism. Besides, innovation behavior of other firms in the same area, qualified local labor, R&D facilities, local market development, technological progress, and technology and innovation policy can contribute to firms? innovation.  \n\nIn this paper we explore firm-level innovation from a human capital point of view using a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms. We consider two types of firm-level human capital: skilled human capital, and managerial human capital. In the empirical study, we use two firm-level datasets from China, one from metropolitan cities and one from provincial middle cities. There are several reasons why examining this relationship for Chinese manufacturing firms is important. First, according to OECD, China was the second largest R&D spender in 2014 and is forecast to overtake the United States in R&D by 2019. However, despite success in some areas, notably high-speed rail, solar energy, supercomputing and space explorations, China is still far from an innovative country. Second, manufacturing plays an important role in China's rapid economic growth and it has contributed more than 40 percent of China's gross domestic product (GDP). Third, in a developing country like China, most sectors are low-and medium-technology sectors and thus innovation is more related to adaptation and learning-by-doing, based on design and process optimization, rather than from R&D. Thus, China provides a good context to examine the effect of human capital's effect on innovation.  \n\nWe use patent applications as our measure of innovation. We find that a firm's skilled human capital has a statistically significant positive effect on innovation while the management team's age has a significantly negative effect on innovation. General Manager's tenure plays a significantly positive role in firm innovation in metropolitan cities, while it is the General Manager's education that plays a positive and significant effect on firm innovation in small and middle cities. The effect of R&D on patents is insignificant in large metropolitan cities, while it is positive and significant in provincial middle cities.  \n\nThis paper makes two main contributions. First, we study firm innovation from a human capital view: not only skilled human capital but also managerial human capital and R&D human capital. While at the macro level human capital has been recognized as an important determinant of innovation in endogenous growth theory (e.g., Romer, 1990), there is somewhat less analysis at the firm level even though human capital has been argued as a critical resource in a firm (Pfeffer, 1995). The studies that have considered human capital as a determinant of firm innovation mostly focus on managerial human capital without considering skilled human capital as human capital base of a firm and external factors, e.g.. firm size and market structure (e.g., McGuirk et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2011). Second, two  \n\ndatasets from two different levels of cities, metropolitan cities and provincial middle cities, enable us to examine the effect of external factors on firm innovation. We empirically show that internal factors such as R&D, skilled human capital, managerial human capital, and other firm characteristics, may have different effect on firm innovation if firms are located in different market environments. Previous studies have typically not been able to examine the moderating effect of external factors on the effects of those factors on firm innovation possibly because of data limitations.  \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II presents empirical specification and estimation. In Section IHI we introduce the data. Section IV presents basic results. Section V presents further investigation. Section VI concludes.  \n\n## I1. Empirical Specification and Estimation  \n\n### A. Specifications and variables  \n\nAmong all the resources in a firm, human capital has long been viewed as critical (Bates, 1990; Pfeffer, 1995; Hitt et al., 2001; Colombo and Grilli, 2005). In this study, we consider two broad aspects of firm-level human capital: skilled human capital; and managerial human capital.  \n\nThe effect of firms’ skilled human capital on innovation can operate via two channels. First, skilled human capital means greater ability of learning-by-doing and can improve a firm's innovation ability. Second, skilled human capital and a firm's R&D together affect the firm's innovation, a complementary relationship modeled by Romer (1990).7  \n\nIn contrast, managerial human capital is embodied in CEOs, top management team, and managers in general. Upper echelon theory (e.g., Hambrick and Mason, 1984) argued that organizations are just reflections of their top managers, because the top management team has the task of formulating and implementing the firm's strategy. Moreover, top executives have the discretion to control, monitor and adjust R&D expenditure.  \n\nTo arrive at an estimating equation, we model the role of human capital in firm innovation by augmenting the patent production function, which is widely used in firm innovation studies (e.g., Hall and Ziedonis, 2001; Hu and Jefferson, 2009). We specify the augmented patent production function as:  \n\n$$\nE(Y_{i})=\\exp(X_{i}^{\\prime}\\beta_{X}+H_{i}^{\\prime}\\beta_{H})\n$$  \n\nwhere $Y_{i}$ is the count of patents of firm $i$ ,thevector $X_{i}$ stands for traditional explanatory variables in patent production function, including R&D expenditures, firm size, market share, firm characteristics that are related to knowledge production and propensity to patent, city fixed effects and industry effects. $H_{i}$ is the human capital vector, including skilled human capital measure, and managerial human capital characteristics (e.g., GM's education, tenure, management team's average education, and age).  \n\nCompared to traditional patent production function, our human capital-augmented patent product function has at least three advantages. First, it can take into account the nonR&D or informal knowledge production, e.g., learning by doing, which is especially important for firms in developing countries where small and medium enterprises (SMEs) often dominate. Second, as studied in Sterlacchini (1999), R&D only accounted for a fraction of total innovation costs and the activities of design, engineering and pre-production developments were all important sources of innovation. Given the importance of human capital in those activities, it is not hard to conclude the importance of human capital's complementary role in innovation. Thus, studies without consideration of human capital might bias the knowledge production ability of R&D. Third, managers are one of the most important sources of the firm heterogeneity. Some of these issues can be better addressed by including human capital indicators in the specification.  \n\nFor equation (1), we can take log for both sides and specify all factors as: $\\begin{array}{r}{\\log(p a t_{i})=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}H C_{i}+\\beta_{2}\\log(R D_{i})+\\beta_{3}S Z_{i}+\\beta_{4}M K T S H R_{i}+\\beta_{5}W_{i}+u_{i},}\\end{array}$ (2), where $p a t_{i}$ is the number of patents applied, $H C_{i}$ is human capital indicators, $R D_{i}$ is R&D expenditure, $S Z_{i}$ is firm size, $M K T S H R_{i}$ is market share, $W_{i}$ stands for control variables, such as industry and city fixed effect, and $u_{i}$ is a disturbance term for firm $i=1,2,\\dots,n$  \n\nWe use the number of patent applications because it reflects more accurately the timing of a firm's R&D behavior.& Skilled human capital, GM's tenure and education, and the average age and education of management team are used as the indicators of managerial human capital. We use number of highly educated workers (by their education levels) to measure a firm's skilled human capital.  \n\nRegarding R&D spending by the firm, much of the early work used lag structure of R&D affects patents (Pakes and Griliches, 1980). Some of the literature uses only contemporaneous level of R&D (Hall and Ziedonis, 2001). R&D expenditure is a long-term investment and takes time to have impact (Barker and Mueller, 2002).? Moreover, contemporaneous R&D is likely to be endogenous, due to the possible correlation between unobserved innovation productivity shocks and R&D level. However, the lag structure is generally difficult to identify because of the high within-firm correlation of R&D expenditure over time. Therefore, we use the average R&D over past years, excluding current R&D.10  \n\nFirm size is measured by total assets. We include market share of each firm to account for a firm's market position. In addition, firm age, ownership, city fixed effect, industry fixed effect are also included as control variables.  \n\n### B. Estimation strategy  \n\nThe number of patents applied for by a firm is a count variable. The OLS estimator for count data allows for negative values in its conditional mean function. However, OLS estimator does not need distribution assumption and is robust to heteroscedasticity. Given this, we also report OLS results. In patent estimation, Poisson and NB maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) are two usual candidates (e.g., Hu and Jefferson 2009, and Hall and Ziedonis 2001). However, for Poisson, the variance is restricted to equal to its mean, the socalled equi-dispersion. In our data, the variance of the dependent variable (the number of patents applied) is much larger than its mean. Therefore, we estimate via NB estimation to allow for overdispersion. Moreover, when the density is misspecified, the estimator is called Quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE).11 Gourieroux, Montfort and Trognon (GMT, 1984) show that when the mean is correctly specified, but other features of the distribution such as the variance and density are potentially misspecified, the MLE is still consistent.  \n\nAnother concern is that there are many firms with zero patents in our dataset and those zero observations are very likely from two quite different data generating processes: firms that don't innovate at all, and firms attempt to innovate but fail to generate patents. Following Hu and Jefferson (2009), we use zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) to model the two processes explicitly. The zero-inflated model supplements Poisson density $f_{P}(\\cdot)$ with a binary process with density $f_{B}(\\cdot)$ . When firms do not innovate at all (i.e., the number of patents  \n\ntakes 0 with probability 1), the binary process takes value 0 with the probability $f_{B}(0)$ When firms do attempt to innovate, i.e., patent count takes value O, 1, 2, ..., from Poisson density the binary process takes value 1 with probability $f_{B}(1)$ . The density is:  \n\n$$\ng(p a t_{i})=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{f_{B}(0)+\\bigl(1-f_{B}(0)\\bigr)f_{P}(0)}&{i f\\qquadp a t_{i}=0}\\ {\\bigl(1-f_{B}(0)\\bigr)f_{P}(p a t_{i})\\qquadi f}&{p a t_{i}\\geq1}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$  \n\nwhere $f_{B}(\\cdot)$ is a logit model and $f_{P}(\\cdot)$ is a Poisson density. Then the new likelihood based on this new density function is maximized.  \n\nThe Poisson density function is:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{Pr}[Y=y]={\\frac{e^{-\\mu}\\mu^{y}}{y!}}\\quad y=0,1,2\\dots\n$$  \n\nIn Poisson model, the standard assumption is to use the exponential mean parameterization for the relationship between the mean parameter $\\mu$ and covariates (regressors) $x$  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{i}=\\exp(x_{i}^{\\prime}\\beta),i=1,\\ldots,N,\n$$  \n\nIn zero-inflated Poisson model, we also need to parameterize $f_{B}(0)$ , i.e., the probability of choosing not to innovate by a firm. Since we use logit link and thus:  \n\n$$\nf_{B}(0)=G(z^{\\prime}\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{1-\\mathrm{exp}(-z^{\\prime}\\gamma)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $z$ are the variables that determine whether a firm chooses to innovate or not and $\\gamma$ are the corresponding coefficients. The likelihood function to be maximized is:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\lefteqn{L(\\beta,\\gamma;\\boldsymbol{x}_{i},z,p a t_{i})}\\qquad}&{}\\ &{=\\displaystyle\\sum_{p a t_{i}=0}\\ln\\{G(z^{\\prime}\\gamma)+[1-G(z^{\\prime}\\gamma)][-\\exp(x_{i}^{\\prime}\\beta)]\\}\\qquad}\\ &{+\\displaystyle\\sum_{p a t_{i}>0}\\{\\ln[1-G(z^{\\prime}\\gamma)]-\\exp(x_{i}^{\\prime}\\beta)+p a t_{i}(x_{i}^{\\prime}\\beta)-\\ln(p a t_{i}!)\\}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBy using zero-inflated Poisson we implicitly assume that all the “zeros\" are from a binary process. If there's still overdispersion after zero-inflated Possion, then zero-inflated  \n\nNB can be used. We also experimented with zero-inflated NB model, but we cannot reject that overdispersion parameter is zero, indicating that zero-inflated Poisson model fits better.  \n\n## III. Data  \n\nWe use data from two surveys conducted by the World Bank.12 The first one is “The Study of Competitiveness, Technology & Firm Linkage” conducted in 2002. The second one is “Investment Climate Survey” conducted in 2003. Though with different names, they form parts of a firm survey series conducted by the World Bank in order to know more about the innovation and technology, firm productivity, finance, labor and the obstacles to do business of Chinese firms.13 Both surveys are filled by the senior manager and the accountant and/or personnel manager of the main production facility of the firm.  \n\nFor both surveys, the most quantitative questions (e.g., total sales, R&D, etc.), covered not only the survey year but also the previous two years in a retrospective way, and thus there are three years of data available for those variables. However, for most qualitative questions (e.g., education of GM, etc.), covered only the time of the survey, so there is only one year available in the data. As a result, the data are a mix of panel data and cross-sectional data from both surveys, depending on the specific variables.  \n\nThe first survey was carried out in 2001-2002, covering firms in five large cities in China, including Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin.14 In the questionnaire, some variables cover the years 1998, 1999, and 2000 and form a panel, but most questions only covered year 2000 as cross-sectional data (we call it Data 2000, thereafter). In this data, there are 1548 firms surveyed and they belong to five manufacturing industries and five services industries.15 The second survey was conducted in 2003 and covered firms in 18 small and middle-sized cities.16 Similarly, some questions covered for year 2000, 2001, and 2002 as panel data, but some only cover year 2002 (we call it Data 2002, thereafter). The second survey includes 2400 firms from 10 manufacturing and 4 services industries.17 For the purpose of this study, we exclude services industries as they may have very different mechanism and patterns in innovation.  \n\nWhereas firms in developed countries operate in environment that are relatively stable, regional differences play an important role in firm innovation in transitional and developing economies like China. Regional innovation studies (e.g., Li, 2009), showed that innovation activities are not evenly distributed spatially and the production of new technological knowledge is more likely to localize spatially. The reasons why different regions in China differ in terms of innovation have been studies a lot. Ning et al (2016) showed that FDI and industry agglomeration together promotes regional innovation. To be specific, FDI spatial spillovers are contingent upon the intensity of industry agglomeration. Kafouros et al. (2015) concluded that sub-national institutional variations have a profound impact on the relationship between academic collaborations and thus firms’ innovation performance. An advantage of using both data sets is that it allows us to see different relationships for innovation between firms in large cities, and in middle and small cities.  \n\nFirms in the small and medium sized cities are mainly in the SME category; there are more big firms in large cities. For example, the mean of the total sales of firms in big firms is almost twice of that of firms in small and middle cities. The $75\\%$ percentile of total sales is 149 million in Data 2000 and only is 80 million RMB in Data 2002. In fact, according to the official definition of small and big firms, there are $11.4\\%$ big firms in big cities and $9.0\\%$ big firms in small and middle cities; there are $32.6\\%$ small firms in big cities and $43.0\\%$ small firms in small and middle cities. Moreover, firms in big cities invest far more R&D than in small and middle cities. The average R&D in firms of big cities is almost seven times more than in small and middle cities. It is also noted that $50\\%$ firms in big cities are foreign invested firms while there are only $29\\%$ in small and middle cities. Thus, by using two similar datasets from two types of cities, large cities and small and middle cities, we provide micro-based evidence and explanation of regional innovation differences.18  \n\nThe firm size in both datasets varies dramatically. For example, the reported total sales range from 2,000 RMB to 31.6 billion RMB in Data 2000, and from 1,500 RMB to 140 billion RMB in Data 2002.19 The total number of workers ranges from 3 to 83,542 in Data 2000 and from 1 to 70,169 in Data 2002. In selecting our sample for studying innovation, we choose firms that are above a threshold in size. Specifically, we select our sample with firm sales no less than RMB 30 million in the non-service industry for both data sets. As a result, there are 386 firms in Data 2000 and 445 firms in Data 2002. In order to test the sensitivity of the results, we also select a larger sample with sales no less than RMB 3 million.  \n\nThe summary statistics are presented in Table 1a (Data 2000) and Table 1b (Data 2002). In Data 2000, the average number of patents applied are 0.50, 1.03 and 1.44 per firm for years 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. In Data 2002, the average patent applications are 0.74, 0.86 and 1.20 for years 2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively. Similarly, the average number of patent actually granted is approximately 0.39-0.98 in big cities while it is 0.78- 1.10 in small and middle cities. The top three cities with patent application in Data 2000 are Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, and in Data 2002 they are Chongqing, Wuhan and Hangzhou. Patent application distributes very unevenly across industries. In both datasets, vehicles and vehicle parts industry, electronic equipment industry, electronic components industry and household electronics industry have the most patent applications. Average patent applications are very similar across two datasets, and show an increasing trend in both. Hu and Jefferson (2009) showed that the intensification of research and development, the growth of foreign direct investment, and amendments to the patent law that favor patent holders and ownership reform account for the increase of patent applications in China. Moreover, firms have marginally more recorded patent applications in Data 2000 than in Data 2002 (1.44 versus 1.20). In addition, in both datasets, there are approximately $20\\%$ firms with nonzero patents.  \n\nFor $80\\%$ firms with zero patents, two channels might contribute to it: (1) firms chooses to not patent (or innovate); (2) firms choose to patent (innovate), but fails. Also, a large percentage of the firms are in the SME category and this, couple with them being in a developing economy explains why a number of firms have zero patents. For the firms with positive patent applications, they applied for approximately 3-8 patents in Data 2000 and approximately for 5-6 patents in Data 2002.20  \n\nTo measure skilled labor we follow Fleisher et al. (2011) and classify the employees into two categories: highly educated and less educated workers.21 By averaging the workers? schooling years for each occupation category (i.e., basic production workers, auxiliary production workers, engineering and technical personnel, managerial personnel, service personnel, and other employees,) over the sample, we designate each occupation level as either highly educated or less educated based on the average schooling of workers in the occupation.22 We find that both “engineering and technical personnel\" and “managerial personnel (including sales)\" have college degree on average (around 14 years of schooling), but “basic production workers\", “auxiliary production workers”, “\"service personnel\"', and \"other employees\" have high school degree on average (around 10 years of schooling). Thus, in our data, the highly educated group mainly consists of “engineering and technical personnel\" and “managerial personnel (including sales)” and other workers of occupations are grouped as “less educated workers\". Note that the survey data only provide information on number of employees for different occupation for the years 2000 and 1998. We impute employment for different occupations for 1999 in Data 2000 and year 2000 in Data 2002.23  \n\nGM's tenure is the years he/she holds position.?4 In the datasets, we have the information on GM's education degree level. Education of the management team is the average years of schooling of all managers in the team. We use market share as a measure for market structure.25  \n\nWe can see that firms in Data 2000 are bigger in terms of total workers, with approximately240-270 highly educated workers and 1300 total employment in Data 2000 and approximately 260-270 highly educated workers and 670 total workers in Data 2002.  \n\nIn both datasets, GMs have more than 14 years of schooling, i.e., undergraduate degree level. In fact, in both datasets, more than $70\\%$ GMs have at least undergraduate degree. GM's education differs a little between two datasets, with a slightly more GMs with postgraduate degree in Data 2000 than Data 2002, $23\\%$ versus $24\\%$ .26  \n\nOn the other side, there's very large difference in R&D between two datasets, with approximately 25-32 Million RMB in Data 2000 and approximately 5-8 Million RMB in Data 2002. Given the fact that the total sales in Data 2000 is only slightly less than in Data 2002, the large difference in R&D between those two datasets is notable. One reason might be that big cities has more supportive policies. The other reason might be that the R&D competition among firms. Another important difference between two datasets is that firms in Data 2000 have a higher market share $17.50\\%)$ than in Data 2002 ( $11.60\\%$ 0.We can alsosee that the ownership structure in the two datasets differ a lot. The reason why the first dataset has more foreign firms might be that it is drawn from big cities which is the main destination of foreign firms due to supportive policies, infrastructure and environment.  \n\nTable 2 presents the differences of human capital indicators between firms with patents and without patents in both datasets. We can see that in both datasets, the firms with patents have more highly educated workers, better educated GM and management team, and younger management team, and all differences are statistically significant. However, for GM's tenure, the difference is mixed (positive for Data 2000 but negative for Data 2002) and is statistically insignificant. We also examined correlation between important variables. We find that in the two datasets the correlation between skilled workers and patents is 0.28 and 0.44 respectively. However, the correlation between R&D and skilled workers differ a lot, with 0.041 in Data 2000 and 0.48 in Data 2002.  \n\n## IV. Estimation Results  \n\nTable 3A and Table 3B report the regression results based on OLS and NB and zeroinflated Poisson estimation. As we discussed in Section II, our analysis will rely on the results of zero-inflated Poisson model. The OLS results are reported to provide a comparison. We only use year 2000 for Data-2000 and year 2002 for Data-2002, because all human capital indicators are only available for the survey year. In both Table 3A and Table 3B, the Vuong test of zero-inflated NB versus standard NB is rejected, indicating that the zeroinflated model is preferred.  \n\nThe results in Table 3A show that the number of highly educated workers has a positive and significant effect on patent applications in big cities (Data 2000). This is true for both datasets regardless of estimation methods (i.e., OLS, NB, or zero-inflated Poisson). From the estimated coefficients, it emerges that when the number of highly educated workers increases by 100 people, the number of patents is expected to increase by $27.3\\%$ in the NB model. Evaluating at the sample average of number of patents (1.44), the number of patents are expected to increase by 0.393. The somewhat large effect indicates that NB model does not fit well. When we consider zero inflated Poisson, we find that skilled human capital has effect on both patent counts and probability of innovation. Compared to the NB, the effect of skilled human capital on patent counts now decreases to $6.18\\%$ . That is, evaluating at the sample average of number of patents, the number of patents are expected to increase only 0.0890. For the OLS estimation, the effect is 0.444; relatively larger in terms of number of patent applied. Our overall results are similar in spirit to Audretsch and Acs (1991), who found that skilled labor has a positive effect on innovation using “industry\" level data.  \n\nIn Table 3B, we also find that skilled human capital also plays an important role in small and middle cities (Data 2002). Across all different models, skilled human capital has a positive effect on firm innovation. In the NB model, when the number of highly educated workers increases by 100, the number of patent applications is expected to increase by $18.5\\%$ . That is, evaluating at the sample average patent counts (1.20), patent counts are expected to increase by 0.222. In zero-inflated Poisson model, we also find that skilled human capital can influence both patent counts but also the probability to innovate.  \n\nSkilled human capital is essential for firms in all cities. In NB model, skilled human capital has a larger effect on firm innovation in big cities (0.273 versus 0.185). Moreover, skilled human capital is more important and more significant in determining a firm’s patent application intensity in big cities (0.0618 versus 0.0407). In contrast, skilled human capital has a slight larger effect on determining probability to innovate. A possible explanation is that in big cities engaging innovation is a common thing for firms and the question faced by firms is how much to invest in innovation while in small and middle cities whether to invest in innovation or not is still a question for at least some firms.  \n\nTurning to managerial effects, we find that the GM's tenure is positive and significant in big cities (Data 2000) across all models. In NB model, we find that when GM's tenure increases by one additional year, the number of patent applications is expected to increase by  \n\n$17.8\\%$ , approximately 0.256 patents evaluated at the sample average of patents. It is slightly smaller than the effect of the OLS estimate of 0.329. Similar as in Data 2000, this effect is unusually large. In zero-inflated model, we find that GM's tenure plays an important role both in determining a firm's innovation decision and patent counts. An increase in GM's tenure will increase a firm's probability to innovate. When the GM's tenure increases by one additional year, the number of patent applications is expected to increase by 0.102 on average. Due to the uncertainties of a firm's innovation endeavor, the rich experience of the GM may help him/her with better vision, strategies, and more effective implementation. However, the evidence in the literature is mixed. For example, Lin et al. (2011) that showed that GM's tenure has a positive effect on R&D expenditure; while Hambrick and Fukutomi (1991) found that a GM tends to make fewer changes in strategy as the tenure increases.27  \n\nThe GM's tenure appears to have different effect in the two datasets: positive and significant in large cities, but no significant effect in middle cities. One possible explanation is that competition in middle cities may not as high as in large cities and thus the GM's experience is not as important. Another explanation is that large cities have more developed market and the market mechanism rewards more experienced manager for innovation.  \n\nThe results show that the coefficient of GM graduate degree is insignificant in Data 2000, but significant in Data 2002. In NB model, when the GM has a postgraduate degree, the firm's patent counts are expected to increase by $113.5\\%$ , or approximately 1.36 more patents. In zero-inflated model, we only find a significant effect on probability of innovation. That is, a GM with postgraduate degree will promote a firm's probability of innovation in small and middle sized cities but have no significant effect on patent applications. More educated executives may have more knowledge and higher ability to absorb new ideas and therefore higher tendency toward accepting innovations (Hitt and Tyler 1991). Such knowledge is likely to be more important in middle cities for the firms to adopt and adapted to more advance technologies from large and relatively developed cities. It is also not hard to understand that the graduate degree of GM is only important for a firm's decision to innovate or not since GM's role in a firm is to make decision.  \n\nCombining the different effects of GM's tenure between two datasets, we conclude that in big cities a firm with a GM with longer tenure will innovate more while in small and middle cities a firm with a GM with a postgraduate degree will innovate more. Thus, to promote firm innovation, a GM with more experience is needed in big cities while a more educated GM is vital in small and middle cities.  \n\nManagement team's average age has a negative and significant effect in both datasets in NB model. When management team's average age increases one year, the number of patents is expected to decrease $9.54\\%$ firms in large cities and $9.23\\%$ middle cities, based on NB estimation. This finding is similar in spirit with some earlier results in the literature (e.g., Hambrick and Mason,1984; and Barker and Mueller, 2002). However, we do not find a significant effect in the zero-inflated Poisson.  \n\nConsistent with other studies (e.g., Schoenecker and Daellenbach, 1995), we find a positive effect of management team's education on firm innovation in Data 2002. We find that management team's average schooling plays an important role in a firm's innovation decision, but no significant effect in patent applications. However, we fail to find a significant effect of management team’s education in Data 2000 in zero-inflated Poisson.  \n\nThe effect of management team's education differs between two datasets. In our preferred model, zero-inflated Poisson, no significant effect was detected in Data 2002, but our result indicates that management team's education plays a positive and significant effect in determining a firm to innovate or not. This is similar with the effect of GM's education that also plays an important role in Data 2002 but has no significant effect in Data 2002.  \n\nAs shown in Table 3A and Table 3B, market share in both datasets has a positive effect on patenting, as commonly found in literature (e.g., Blundell et al., 1999). While market share has a positive effect, the patterns vary. In Data 2000, it has an important effect of raising a firm’s patent counts but has no significant effect on increasing the probability of innovation. When market share increases by $1\\%$ , patent applications are expected to increase by $1.42\\%$ . In Data 2002, it has an important effect of raising a firm's probability of innovation rather than increasing patent counts. R&D spending has positive and significant effect only in small and middle cities, consistent with some previous studies (e.g., Pakes and Griliches, 1980; Brouwer and Kleinknecht, 1999). In particular, when R&D increases by $1\\%$ ， the number of patents is expected to increase by $0.0938\\%$ in Data 2002 in NB model. Moreover, the zero-inflated Poisson results indicate that R&D only plays a role in increasing patent counts rather than promoting a firm's probability to innovate. OLS and NB results confirm this finding though with a bigger estimated effect. We failed to find a significant effect of R&D in Data 2000 for large cities. One explanation is that, with the control of various human capital in the firm, R&D may be less critical.  \n\nBased on our estimation results, we can see that compared to many other firm innovation studies, as opposed to R&D, firm size and market structure, factors related to skilled human capital appear to be a more important influence in a firm to determine if it will be more innovative or not. Once we control human capital factors, we find no significant effect of firm size at all. We find positive effect of market share on innovation though with differing patterns. In large cities, market share tends to increase patent counts but in small and middle cities market share tends to increase its probability to innovation. Moreover, we find that R&D has very different effect on innovation in different types of cities: it has a significant effect both statistically and economically on firm innovation in small and middle cities but no effect at all in big cities. Another important finding is that in large cities, GM tenure or experience plays an important role in firm innovation but in small and middle cities education (GM graduate degree and management team's schooling) is more important. This is consistent with intuition. In big cities, there's an abundance of highly educated human capital and in this situation experience becomes the critical factor. On the other hand, in small and middle cities, highly educated human capital should be much less than in big cities.  \n\n## V. Further Investigation  \n\nNext, we address an identification problem. A firm's level of skilled human capital may be endogenous, because factors affecting a firm's workforce adjustment are very likely to be related to firm's innovation potential and path. For example, a firm that wants to be active in innovation would tend to hire more highly educated workers. Thoenig and Verdier (2003) mentioned that by employing a larger share of skilled labor, firms can reduce informational leakages and spillovers, and thereby lessen the threat of imitation. Moreover, successful innovation may also increase the proportion of skilled workers in the whole workforce (Krueger, 1993) because more advanced technology needs to be complementary to be productive. Therefore, skilled human capital and GM education can be correlated with, unobservable firm-specific characteristics (Fleisher et al. 2011).  \n\nWhen endogenous variables exist, both OLS and NB estimator will be inconsistent. We apply instrumental variable estimation and control function approach to estimate the models. In particular, let $y_{1}$ denote the dependent variable, $y_{2}$ the endogenous explanatory variables, and zthe $1\\times L$ vector of exogenous variables and instruments (which includes unity as its first element). Assume the mean function as:  \n\n$$\nE(y_{1}|z,y_{2},\\varepsilon_{1})=\\exp(\\mathsf{z}_{1}\\delta_{1}+\\alpha_{1}y_{2}+\\varepsilon_{1}),\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{z}_{1}$ is a $1\\times L_{1}$ strict subvector of zand $\\varepsilon_{1}$ is the error term. Suppose first that $y_{2}$ has a standard linear reduced form with an additive and independent error  \n\n$$\ny_{2}=z\\pmb{\\pi}_{2}+v_{2},\n$$  \n\nand the joint distribution of $\\varepsilon_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ is independent of $\\mathbf{z}.$ . Then we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\cal E}(y_{1}|{\\bf z},y_{2})={\\cal E}(\\exp({z_{1}}{\\delta_{1}}+\\alpha_{1}y_{2}+\\varepsilon_{1})|{\\bf z},y_{2})}}\\ {~}\\ {{\\displaystyle~={\\cal E}(\\exp(\\varepsilon_{1})|v_{2})\\exp({z_{1}}{\\delta_{1}}+\\alpha_{1}y_{2})}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAlso, $E(\\exp(\\varepsilon_{1})|v_{2})=E(\\exp(\\varepsilon_{1}|v_{2}))=\\exp\\bigl(E(\\varepsilon_{1}|v_{2})\\bigr).$ According to one theorem of bivariate normal distribution, if $(\\varepsilon_{1},v_{2})$ are jointly normal, then $E(\\varepsilon_{1}|v_{2})$ will be linear in $v_{2}$ Under the assumptionof zero mean of $\\varepsilon_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ , we then get that. $E(\\varepsilon_{1}|v_{2})=\\theta_{1}v_{2}$ , where $\\theta_{1}$ is a constant.28 Finally, we get that $E(\\exp(\\varepsilon_{1})|v_{2})=\\exp(\\theta_{1}v_{2})$ .Then  \n\n$$\nE(y_{1}|\\mathbf{z},y_{2})=E(y_{1}|\\mathbf{z},v_{2})=\\exp(\\mathbf{z}_{1}\\delta_{1}+\\alpha_{1}y_{2}+\\theta_{1}v_{2}).\n$$  \n\nThis suggests a two-step estimation procedure. The first step is to estimate the reduced form for $y_{2}$ and obtain the residuals. Second, include $\\hat{v}_{2}$ , along with $\\mathbf{z}_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ , in NB.  \n\nTherefore, in the first stage of control function method, we regress all endogenous variables (i.e. number of skilled workers and CEO's education) on all exogenous variables including instrumental variables and get two residuals using OLS. In the second stage, we regress the dependent variable (patent applications) on all the variables in the original model and the two residuals using NB. Wooldridge (2015) pointed out that control function is likely more efficient than a direct IV approach. We also include 2SLS to check the consistency.  \n\nThough in linear models, 2SLS estimates are identical to control function estimates. In nonlinear model such as exponential model, they are different as we'll see in the following.  \n\nTo find valid instruments for total number of skilled workers, we follow Fleisher et al. (2011), and use the number of applicants for the positions and the average number of weeks those positions are vacant as instruments. A firm with more skilled human capital is more likely to attract more applicants and thus less vacant weeks for those positions. Meanwhile, number of applicants and vacant weeks are largely influenced by the behavior of job seekers and the labor supply side, and thus should be exogenous to unobserved firm innovation heterogeneity.29 Additionally, we use average skilled human capital over cities and average skilled human capital over industries (both excluding firm itself) as instruments. Those averages are correlated with firm's skilled human capital due to industry and city norms and characteristics, but not correlated with firm's unobserved heterogeneity.  \n\nGM's education can also be endogenous. A firm that wants to be active in innovation might employ GM with higher education level. We use industry average as well as city average of GM's education, excluding firm itself in calculating the average, as instruments.  \n\nThe results are reported in Table 4. As seen in the table, the over-identification test does not reject the null that the over-identifying instruments are valid assuming a subset of the instruments is valid and identified the model.3° For skilled human capital, after considering endogeneity, we get that when the number of skilled workers increase by 100, the number of patents is expected to increase by $27.6\\%$ in Data 2000, and $19.7\\%$ in NB Data 2002. Compared to the results reported earlier, there's almost no change. For the effect of postgraduate degree of GM, when the GM has a postgraduate degree, the patent counts are expected to increase by $132.8\\%$ , or approximately 1.59 more patents. Similarly, we observed that there's almost no change in the effect of GM's tenure.  \n\nIn Data 2000, we notice that now the coefficient of management team's age remains significant and similar magnitude in both models. In Data 2002, we get that when management team's average age increases by 1 year, patent counts are expected to decrease by $7.12\\%$ , a little larger than in basic results; while for Data 2000, the effect is similar and it $10\\%$ . The management team's education becomes insignificant in Data 2000 while it remains similar significant effect in Data 2002. When management team's schooling increases one year, the firm's patent counts are expected to increase by $27\\%$ . We notice that the effect of management team's schooling changes a lot, from significant become insignificant in large cities while it becomes more significant and have a little larger effect in middle cities. This might indicate that the endogeneity of human capital indicators is different between two datasets. This is also confirmed by the results of Hausman test. In Data 2000, we reject that the human capital indictors are endogenous with p-value equal to 0.0655 at $10\\%$ , while in Data 2002 we accept that the human capital indicators are exogenous with pvalue equal to 0.873.  \n\nWe know that in control function method, the including of residuals not only control endogeneity but also enables us to test the endogeneity. A significant error term indicates the endogeneity of suspected variable; vice versa. To ensure the validity of the test, we also bootstrap the standard errors. In Table 4, the residual from first stage is insignificant in Data 2000 but significant in Data 2002, indicating that the suspect variables are exogenous in Data 2000 and endogenous in Data 2002. From the above analysis, we can see that even in Data 2000, the results haven't changed a lot after considering endogeneity. Thus, we can conclude that the results we reported earlier still hold.  \n\nFinally, we wanted to check whether our results are sensitive to sample selection. We relaxed the firm size threshold to firms with no less than 3 million RMB total sales. These results are presented in Table A1. A and Table A1.B. Compared to results in Table 3, there's little change in Table A1. A and Table A1.B. Skilled human capital still plays an important role in firm innovation and its effect varies: in big cities it is important to both innovation probability and innovation intensity but it is only vital in determining a firm's innovation probability in small and middle cities. Moreover, GM's experience is still more important in big cities while GM's education is still more important in small and middle cities for firm innovation. In addition, R&D still only plays a vital role in firm innovation in small and middle cities while has no significant effect on firm innovation in big cities.  \n\n## VI. Concluding Remarks  \n\nAs human capital is one of firms? critical resources, we examined its impact on firms^ innovation. In our analysis, we emphasized the human capital characteristics of a firm's workforce as well as the decision makers, the General Manager and the management team. Skilled human capital can affect a firm's probability of success. And managerial capital could affect a firm's project and R&D choice.  \n\nThe human capital indicators we used are skilled human capital (number of highly educated workers), General Manager's education and tenure, and the management team's education and age. Our overall results show that skilled human capital plays an important role in firms? innovation, but its effect varies somewhat: in big cities it is important to both innovation probability and innovation intensity, but it is only vital in determining a firm's innovation probability in small and medium cities. The General Manager's experience is more important in big cities, while the General Manager's education is more important in small and medium cities. The management team's schooling in firms from small and medium cities plays a more important role in firm innovation than of big cities. The management team's age has a similar significant and negative effect on firm innovation in both datasets. In addition, R&D appears to play an important role in firm innovation in small and medium cities, and has no significant effect in big cities. The effect of R&D on patents is insignificant in large metropolitan cities while it is positive and significant in smaller and medium cities.  \n\nIn future extensions of our work, we are pursuing one additional aspect that could shed light on firms’ innovation paths and outcomes: examining the differences between small versus large firms in the link between human capital and innovation.  \n\nOur study highlights two key results. First, based on the broad spectrum of our results on human capital, it appears that policies to promote innovation, especially in developing economies, need to incentivize steps to improve human capital formation and accumulation in all firms. As lack of scientific and technological resources of a country, as manifested in the human-capital component, can diminish the standards of living, policies to promote scientific and managerial education and training can have far ranging benefits for economic development. Second, we find that R&D expenditures appear to have a more potent effect on innovation in the less developed areas within the country. This suggest that policies and resources to promote R&D should focus on the less developed regions for greater nationwide effectiveness and increase innovation.  \n\nReferences   \n1. Audretsch, D.

We find clear evidence of lumpy adjustment consistent with the presence of non-convexities in the adjustment technology - inaction is pervasive, action spells are short-lived, extreme adjustment episodes occur and are responsible for a non-trivial share of employment adjustment. We also find that the probability of employment adjustment increases with the duration of inaction (positive duration dependence). The skill structure of the workforce, the type of employment contract and the proportion of low tenure workers, which we interpret as proxies for the magnitude of adjustment costs, all influence the probability of adjustment.  \n\nJEL Classification: J23, J63  \n\nKeywords: adjustment costs, job flows, worker flows, duration models  \n\nCorresponding author:  \n\nJosé Varejao   \nFaculdade de Economia   \nUniversidade do Porto   \nRua Dr Roberto Frias   \n4200-464 Porto   \nPortugal   \nEmail: varejao@fep.up.pt  \n\n## 1 Introduction  \n\nLabor economists long-standing interest in the behavior of productivity over the business cycle and the impact of job-security policies motivated a by-now large literature on the path of employment adjustment towards new steady-states. More recently, macroeconomists′ attention has also been drawn at the micro-foundations of aggregate employment adjustment.  \n\nThe standard approach to the dynamics of employment adjustment assumes a convex adjustment cost technology which generates a smooth, partial adjustmentlike, path towards new equilibriums. 1 However, non-convex adjustment cost structure have consistently been found to fit micro-data better, outperforming alternative specifications of the adjustment cost function (Hamermesh 1989, 1993a; Anderson 1993; Rota, 1994). Empirical investigation of the patterns of factor adjustment have also documented the importance of \"lumpy” adjustment. Although this is especially true for investment (Doms and Dunne, 1998; Gelos and Isgut, 2001; Nilsen and Schiantarelli, 2003), convincing evidence has also been presented for labor as well (Caballero et al., 1997).2  \n\nAt the plant level, non-convexities in the adjustment technology shape the patterns of employment adjustment in at least four diferent ways. First, nonconvex adjustment costs translate into the distribution of employment adjustment that is expected to exhibit a high proportion of extreme events. Fixed or linear adjustment costs imply that micro-units experience episodes of sharp adjustment followed by relatively long periods of no adjustment. Such a pattern of adjustment implies that a non-trivial share of aggregate employment adjustment is accounted for by these extreme events, which result in long fat tails of the employment change distribution.  \n\nSecond, non-convex adjustment costs also imply that inaction is optimal even outside the steady-state, which is contrary to what occurs if adjustment costs are convex. The fact that establishments or frms are inactive for a large number of time-periods is an indication of the importance of one type of adjustment costs Over the other.  \n\nThird, for each employer, non-convex adjustment costs imply few, extreme and short-lived adjustment episodes, action being most likely followed by inaction. If, on the contrary, adjustment is smooth and persistent it must be that convex adjustment costs dominate.  \n\nFourth, the presence of non-convexities in the adjustment technology implies that, besides sharp and rare, adjustment episodes are most likely followed by inaction.  \n\nIn this paper we provide a detailed analysis of establishment-level employment adjustment. We focus on the nonconvex adjustment cost case and compare its various implications against Portuguese data. Differently put, we investigate if and how labor adjustment departs from the standard convex adjustment cost model. Our approach has two steps. First, we document the patterns of employment adjustment at the establishment level and quarterly frequency. Micro and quarterly (or more frequent) data are essential for studying the dynamics of factor adjustment because aggregation (spatial or temporal) smoothes away any nonlinearities present at the plant or firm levels (Hamermesh, 1993b). In the second step, we estimate the the probability of employment adjustment conditioning on the length of stay at a non-adjustment situation (that is, the hazard function). Controlling for worker attributes and using proxies for the costs of adjustment (such as the proportion of workers with low firing cost contracts and the skill-composition of the workforce) we obtain estimates of the relevant parameters. The slope of the hazard function is also of interest as it has been linked, under some assumptions, to the structure of the underlying adjustment costs (Power, 1994; Cooper et al., 1999; Nilsen and Schiantarelli, 2003).  \n\nIn all the empirical work, we use Portuguese data. Portugal is an interesting case study because of its high levels of job protection which result in very high firing costs. Collective dismissal rules involving a substantial amount of red tape apply to the dismissal of as few as two or five employees depending on the size of the establishment being above or below a fifty-employee threshold. These and other similar rules are responsible for the fact that the Portuguese labor market emerges as the most regulated in Europe in all existing rankings of indexes of employment protection (e.g., OECD, 1999) even if Portugal was the first country to introduce fixed-term contracts in Europe as soon as in 1976. These contracts were conceived as a form of fexibility at the margin by offering employers the opportunity of hiring new workers on a much less stringent basis. 3 In this sense, the evidence we present and the estimates we obtain may be thought of as upperbounds for the corresponding results in other countries. At quarterly (but not yearly) frequencies, the magnitude of job fows in Portugal is much less than in other countries. 4  \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the dataset used is described. The concentration of job and worker fows and the frequency of inaction are analyzed in Section 3. In Section 4 individual employment series are characterized and the presence of spikes in those series is investigated. In Section 5, employment regimes are defined and transitions across regimes are described. In Section 6, the statistical analysis of duration data is used to identify the role of the type of contracting and workforce characteristics on the probability of starting an adjustment episode. Section 7 concludes.  \n\n## 2 The Data  \n\nThe data used in this article come from two sources: the Inquérito ao Emprego Estruturado (IEE) which is a quarterly survey with detailed information on job and worker fows at the establishment level and Quadros de Pessoal which is an annual longitudinal matched employer-employee dataset based on a survey mandatory for all establishments with wage earners. Both surveys are run by the Portuguese  \n\nMinistry of Employment. The two sources share the same establishment identifier and can therefore be merged.  \n\nEstablishments of all sizes and in all industries are included in the IEE dataset.5 The sample is drawn from the universe of the respondents to the 1990 spell of Quadros de Pessoal (QP). The probability of units with fewer than 100 employees being selected to the IEE sample is inversely related to the size of the establishment. Above that threshold, establishments are selected with certainty.6 The sample is statistically representative for three-digit industries (as defined by the SIC code), region and size class. For this purpose, seven regions - five in mainland Portugal and the islands of Madeira and the Azores - were considered and six size classes were defined.  \n\nThe IEE data used here span over twenty quarters, from the first quarter of 1991 until the last quarter of 1995. On average, 6,954 establishments respond to each spell of the survey.  \n\nThe original twenty quarterly files were subsequently converted into two datasets that are, hereinafter, referred to as the pooled dataset and the longitudinal dataset.  \n\nThe pooled dataset simply pools all the twenty quarterly files. No major modifications to the original files were made except that all records (127) with zero employment at both the beginning and end of period were deleted. The pooled dataset contains 139,076 records corresponding to 10,673 establishments. 7  \n\nThe longitudinal dataset results from merging the twenty quarterly files. All records in every quarterly file have an identification code that is unique and does not change during the whole period the establishment remains in the sample. This code number served as the key for merging the two original files. As a result, an unbalanced panel of 10,673 establishments was obtained.8  \n\nQuarterly measures of job fows were computed using the end-of-period headcount reported in two adjacent spells of the survey. The hiring and separation rates were computed using the information on the total number of hirings and separations reported by the respondent units in each spell of the survey. The dataset also contains information on the end-of-period head-count by type of contract. Combining this information with the establishment head-count permitted us to compute, for each establishment, the proportion of workers of the establishment with fixed-term contracts and employed on a part-time basis as well as the gender composition of the workforce.  \n\nTo estimate the duration models in the second step of our empirical approach we would like to control for as many relevant characteristics of the establishments workforce as possible, in particular, if these may be interpreted as proxy variables for the magnitude of labor adjustment costs. Some of these variables are not present in the IEE dataset but they may be imported from the QP survey. This is implemented by merging each quarterly spell of the IEE data with the corresponding QP annual file. By doing so we are able to obtain information on the skill composition of the establishments’ workforce (with nine levels, from Top Cadres to Apprentices), on the tenure distribution at the establishment level, and on the age of the firm the establishment is affiliated with. It is this dataset that results from the merge of the two sources that is used in Section 6.  \n\n## 3 The Distribution of Job and Worker Turnover  \n\nThe obvious starting point to check for signs of lumpy adjustment processes is to examine the distribution of net and gross job fows.  \n\nThe first notable fact is the extraordinary amount of inaction in the data - for 74.7 percent of the establishments in the dataset employment remains unaltered over the course of an entire quarter (Figure 1). In terms of gross fows, the proportion of units reporting zero hires or zero separations is 83.7 and 80.6 percent, respectively. On average, at least three quarters of all observed units do not change employment, hire any worker or separate from any of its workers over an entire quarter. These results document a previously unsuspected degree of inaction which is clear and direct evidence of the presence of non-linearities in the adjustment technology at the micro-level.  \n\n![](images/70ee2b47308a990290dd2e5953ce34656d49536432417e86fa96f0a94ae9cc75.jpg)  \nFigure 1: DISTRIBUTION OF NET EMPLOYMENT CHANGES (1991-95).  \n\nZero net employment change is not synonymous to complete inaction. Establishments with stable employment hire every quarter one percent of their workforce (Table 1). These are replacement hires, implying that the same number of workers leave the establishment over the quarter, the majority (60 percent) voluntarily. The intensity of workers fows in this group of establishments combined with their large numbers originates that \"inactive” units are responsible for 10.3 percent of all the hiring activity in the economy and 8.5 percent of all separations (Table 1).9  \n\nTo check for the importance of large and small adjustment episodes, we also plotted the distribution of job creation and job destruction - Figure 2. That figure represents the proportion of jobs created (destroyed) by establishments expanding (contracting) at different growth rate intervals (as measured in the horizontal axis). By design, establishments with zero job turnover (which are a vast majority)  \n\nTable 1: JOB AND WORKER TURNOVER, BY EMPLOYMENT REGIME.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>All</td><td>△E<0</td><td>△E= ：0</td><td>△E>0</td></tr><tr><td>Hiring Rate Separations Rate Worker Turnover Rate Job Creation Rate JobDestructionRate</td><td>3.7 4.5 8.1 2.3 3.1</td><td>1.5 10.1 11.6 0.0 8.5</td><td>1.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 0.0</td><td>11.7 2.6 14.2 9.1 0.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>Quit Rate % of all establishments</td><td>2.1</td><td>4.3</td><td>0.6</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>100.0</td><td>14.1</td><td>74.7</td><td>11.2</td></tr><tr><td>% of all hires</td><td>100.0</td><td>14.5</td><td>10.3</td><td>75.2</td></tr><tr><td>% of all separations</td><td>100.0</td><td>78.0</td><td>8.5</td><td>13.5</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n$\\Delta E=$ Net employment change.

Worker Turnover Rate is the sum of the hiring and separation rates. Churning Rate equals the difference between the worker turnover rate and the job reallocation rate; it is the part of the worker turnover that is not due to the creation and destruction of positions. The Quit Rate is the number of quits (workers who left either voluntarily or because of a mutually agreed termination of contract) divided by the period's employment average.  \n\nare excluded from this figure as their contribution to total job creation or job destruction is null.1o The bars to the right of the origin correspond to job creation and those to the left to job destruction. Smaller episodes of job creation and destruction (those that imply an employment variation of as much as 10 percent) are concentrated in the first columns to the right and to the left of the origin.  \n\nThe height of these two columns indicates that establishments experiencing mild employment changes account for about 30 and 34 percent of all job creation and destruction, respectively. The complement to this information is that, on both margins, job Hows are concentrated in establishments that are going through sharp employment changes: the share of job creation accounted for by establishments expanding more than 10 percent (conventionally measured) is 70 percent, whereas the corresponding figure for job destruction is 66 percent. Concentration is slightly greater for job creation than for job destruction, but both spread over the entire  \n\n![](images/25bec2cd56dc6c10423001f3d0c076874c2a35b82ae2752dd4ae2e18a88e3385.jpg)  \nFigure 2: DISTRIBUTION OF JOB CREATION AND JOB DESTRUCTION (1991-95).  \n\nrange of employment growth rates.  \n\nThe distribution of gross job fows - hiring and separations - is represented in Figures 3 and 4. The height of each column in this figure measures the proportion of all hirings (separations) that are accounted for by establishments hiring (firing) workers at different rates (measured on the horizontal axis). The height of the two first columns in each panel indicates that only 34 percent of all hirings and 36 percent of all separations occur at establishments hiring or separating in a single period the equivalent to less than 10 percent of its average workforce in the same period. But the tails of both distributions also indicate that a non-trivial number of establishments experience extreme episodes of hiring and firing.  \n\nInaction pervasiveness and fat tails in the distribution of job fows indicate how important lumpy adjustment is. For both net and for gross employment fows, strong evidence of lumpy adjustment coexists with signs of smooth adjustment.  \n\n![](images/9cd7a54e0242b3f3b4151f627cec4d511753c5c39f26aff6df83ee9aedec2256.jpg)  \nFigure 3: DISTRIBUTION OF HIRINGS  \n\n## 4  Spikes in Individual Employment Series  \n\nThe distinctive characteristic of the pattern of employment adjustment implied by non-convex adjustment cost structures is the presence of spikes - i.e., large relatively to the remaining adjustment episodes but also infrequent moments of sharp employment adjustment. Adjustment qualifies as sharp if its magnitude is of an order higher than that observed for most of the sample period.  \n\nAn appropriate way of checking for the presence of spikes is to put each establishment's adjustment record in one quarter against the background of its entire record over the whole sample period (twenty quarters). Hence, we computed quarterly rates of turnover (net and gross) on a establishment-by-establishment basis. Three series for each unit in the panel - one for the net employment change, another for the hiring rate and the third for the separation rate - were thus obtained. Each individual series is then ordered from its highest value (rank 1) to the lowest (rank 20).11 If the employment series exhibits spikes, the first ranks of each individual series should be of a magnitude significantly greater than that of the remaining ranks. For example, if only one spike occurred during the whole sample period, then rank 1 corresponds to the sole period with a spike and will be much greater than rank 2 and all the subsequent ranks, which, in this case, will not correspond to spikes. If no spikes occurred (as we expect if adjustment costs are convex), then all the 20 ranks of each series will be of a similar magnitude.  \n\n![](images/5bb844e7eb85e0caf65cc6af913c903ce34ec75c57cf9886bf1537cbf7339440.jpg)  \nFigure 4: DISTRIBUTION OF SEPARATIONS  \n\nIn the final step, the average of each rank was computed across establishments. These figures are represented in Figures 5, 6, and 7. What they tell us is, for example, for hiring rates, that the sharpest hiring episode, which for different plants may have occurred in different calendar quarters, corresponds to an average hiring rate of 18 percent (rank 1). The figures corresponding to the remaining ranks should be interpreted similarly, remembering that rank 2 corresponds to the  \n\n![](images/a91968beb816de6c5d4c039d8f74e03a7ba90651ec5581212a6a818bb99d3266.jpg)  \nFigure 5: NET EMPLOYMENT FLOw RATES, BY RANK  \n\nsecond sharpest episode, and so on.  \n\nThe purpose of constructing these series is to compare the magnitude of the highest rank of each series (the highest and the lowest in the case of the net employment change series) to the adjacent ranks. As discussed, the difference between the highest and the second highest ranks in each series measures the relative importance of the two sharpest adjustment episodes, large differences indicating the presence of spikes and lumpy adjustment processes.  \n\n![](images/a4308da94d1c409145957da68c604519986014afb49f93c530148883ed0b05b7.jpg)  \nFigure 6: HIRING RATES, BY RANK  \n\nFor the net employment change series the mean of rank 1 is 7.3 percent and of rank 20 is -12.3 percent (Figure 5). This means that the greatest (least) net employment change corresponds to 7.3 (-12.3) percent of the average employment in the quarter in which the change occurred. Figure 5 also indicates that rank 1 is more than 70 percent higher than rank 2 and rank 19 is 66 percent higher than rank 20. This indicates that large episodes of net employment adjustment are, indeed, extreme events in the history of employment adjustment of the individual establishments. There is no way these results may be unequivocally taken to indicate the presence of lumpy adjustment. We do, however, refer to the simulation exercise done by Doms and Dunne (1998) who, in the case of capital, find that frictionless adjustment is symmetric and does not drop as quickly or have as many periods with low capital accumulation activity as in real data. Moreover, with lumpy adjustment, the height of each rank falls sharply after the first rank and then stays close to zero as it also happens with their data. Our results display a pattern of adjustment closer to that obtained with real data on capital and with lumpy adjustment on simulated data than to simulated frictionless data.  \n\n![](images/cac7d067e31192f93616750ec6710fc4872e14620060103450de781908bc6a5d.jpg)  \nFigure 7: SEPARATION RATES, BY RANK  \n\nEvidence in favor of lumpy adjustment is even clearer with gross fows. 12 At its maximum, the hiring rate represents about 18 percent of the establishment's workforce and this percentage drops off significantly after rank 1 (Figure 6). An even more pronounced picture is obtained on the separations’ side. The average of the establishment-level maximum separation rate rounds off to 23 percent and it also drops off significantly after rank 1 (Figure 7).13 Both hiring and separation rates are below 5 percent after rank 5 and remain above zero until rank 20, indicating how infrequent even mildly large adjustment episodes are.  \n\n## 5 Quarterly Transition Rates across Employment Regimes  \n\nThe importance of large and infrequent episodes of employment adjustment was documented in previous sections. However, if this pattern of adjustment is to be attributed to non-convexities in the adjustment cost technology, it is essential to also analyze the sequence of events. Convex adjustment costs imply that one period of adjustment is followed by yet another period of adjustment, the intensity of episodes decreasing over time. On their side, non-convex adjustment costs imply that one period of adjustment is followed by periods of inaction.  \n\nTo distinguish between these two adjustment patterns, all establishments in each period were classified into one employment regime and their situation one period ahead was recorded. Six alternative employment regimes as defined in Table 2, were considered. This information was then used to compute the probabilities of transition across regimes. With convex adjustment costs, we should observe high probabilities of false transitions (transitions into the same regime). With non-convex adjustment costs we should observe high probabilities of transition to the inaction regime, which should be a resilient regime.  \n\nThe focus of our analysis is therefore on the main diagonal of the matrix of probabilities of transition across employment regimes. High values on this diagonal must be taken as signals of smooth adjustment, except for the cell corresponding to the inaction regime. Signals of lumpy adjustment must show as high values in the third column of the matrix, where the probabilities of transition from action to inaction and of inaction persistence are documented.  \n\nLooking first at the main diagonal of the matrix in Table 1, it becomes clear that with the exception of the expansion regimes (regimes 4 and 5), establishments in each regime are likely to be in that same state one period ahead. Expanding establishments (regimes 4 and 5) will most likely move into the inaction regime (regime 3). Seventy percent of all establishments that visit the inaction regime in one quarter will still be in that same regime in the subsequent quarter.  \n\nTable 2: TRANSITION ACROSS EMPLOYMENT ADJUSTMENT REGIMES.   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"6\">Regime</td></tr><tr><td>Regime</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>1 (△ E< 0,H =0)</td><td>29.7</td><td>15.0</td><td>27.3</td><td>5.3</td><td>12.3</td><td>10.0</td></tr><tr><td>2 2 (△E<0,H>0)</td><td>21.0</td><td>34.0</td><td>7.3</td><td>7.3</td><td>7.2</td><td>23.2</td></tr><tr><td>3 (△ E = 0,H =0)</td><td>14.5</td><td>1.9</td><td>70.0</td><td>3.2</td><td>8.5</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>4 (△ E = 0,H > 0)</td><td>20.7</td><td>15.5</td><td>24.9</td><td>11.2</td><td>13.0</td><td>14.8</td></tr><tr><td>5 (△ E>0, S=0)</td><td>24.8</td><td>8.9</td><td>36.0</td><td>7.6</td><td>15.4</td><td>7.3</td></tr><tr><td>6 (△ E>0, S> 0)</td><td>15.1</td><td>30.0</td><td>7.3</td><td>7.4</td><td>8.9</td><td>31.4</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nColumn three tells us that those establishments that make a true transition move primarily to the inaction regime (the exceptions being transitions originating in regimes 2 - employment declining, but hiring-, and in regime 6 - employment increasing but with separations).  \n\nThe resilience of the inaction regime and, particularly, the importance of this regime as a destination of all establishments that make a transition from one quarter to the next are consistent with fixed adjustment costs. This result should be emphasized as the regime definition that has been used biases the results in favor of smooth adjustment. Here, for an establishment to be classified as inactive, not a single worker is allowed to move in or out of the establishment. 14 Complete inaction is even less likely because natural attrition, which is observed as a visit to one action regime (regime 1 or 2), implies positive separations. .15  \n\n## 6 A Duration Model of Employment Adjustment  \n\n### 6.1 Estimation Procedure  \n\nThe estimation of the hazard function, as applied to the context of employment adjustment, starts with the definition of the duration variable (t) that measures the establishment's time of stay in the inaction regime. For that purpose, a fowsampling scheme was adopted. According to this scheme, each establishment is selected upon entry to the inaction regime (at which point its individual clock is set to zero) and followed until exit time. All units are observed over a fixed time interval (from the first quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 1995). Hence, left censoring is eliminated by construction, but right censoring may exist and must be accommodated.  \n\nA useful concept in statistical analysis of a duration phenomenon is the hazard function. In the study of inaction duration, the hazard function gives the instantaneous probability of adjusting employment at $t$ ,given that the establishment stayed inactive until $t$  \n\n$$\nh(t)=\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\left(P(t\\leq T<t+\\Delta t\\mid T\\geq t)\\right.}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=\\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}.\n$$  \n\nwhere $f(t)$ is the probability density function, $F(t)$ is the distribution function, $S(t)$ is the survival function. A useful function is the integrated hazard function  \n\n$$\n\\Lambda(t)=\\int_{0}^{t}h(u)d u\n$$  \n\nwhich relates to the survivor function simply by  \n\n$$\nS(t)=e x p\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t}h(u)d u\\right)=e x p(-\\Lambda(t))\n$$  \n\nIn this paper we employ a conventional Weibull hazard model  \n\n$$\nh(t)=\\rho\\lambda^{\\rho}t^{\\rho-1}\n$$  \n\nwhich implies the following survival function:  \n\n$$\nS(t)=e x p[-(\\lambda t)^{\\rho}]\n$$  \n\nand the corresponding cumulative hazard function  \n\n$$\n\\Lambda(t)=(\\lambda t)^{\\rho}\n$$  \n\nThe Weibull distribution function is a natural choice since it allows a direct test of duration dependence based solely on its shape parameter $\\rho$ .A $\\rho$ parameter lower than 1 indicates negative duration dependence. Symmetrically, $\\rho>1$ implies monotonic increasing hazard rates through time. An exponential duration distribution (and a constant hazard function) is implied by $\\rho=1$  \n\nIn this paper we shall also distinguish between two exit modes out of the inaction regime: employment increase or decrease. Thus, we define cause-specific hazard functions to destination $j$  \n\n$$\nh(t)_{r}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\left(P(t\\leq T<t+\\Delta t,R=r\\mid T\\geq t)\\right.\\mathrm{~}\\left.\\Delta t\\right.}{\\Delta t}}\n$$  \n\nwhich yield the aggregate hazard function  \n\n$$\nh(t)=\\sum_{j=1}^{2}h_{j}(t)\n$$  \n\nand the survivor function  \n\n$$\nS(t)=\\prod_{j=1}^{2}S_{j}(t)\n$$  \n\nwhere $S_{j}(t)=e^{-\\Lambda_{j}(t)}$ and $\\begin{array}{r}{\\Lambda_{j}(t)=\\int_{0}^{t}h_{j}(u)d u}\\end{array}$  \n\nThe model has a conventional competing risks interpretation. In this framework, a latent duration $(T_{j})$ attaches to each exit mode. We only observe the minimum of each latent variable. If risks are assumed to be independent, with continuous duration, this model simplifies to two separate single-cause hazard models.  \n\nA common way to accommodate the presence of observed individual heterogeneity is to specify a proportional hazards model  \n\n$$\nh(t\\mid x)=h_{0j}(t)e x p(x^{\\prime}\\beta_{j})\n$$  \n\nwhere $h_{0j}(t)$ denotes the baseline specific hazard function, that is, the hazard function corresponding to zero values for the covariates $x$ . In this case, the covariates affet the hazard function proportionall (i.e. $\\begin{array}{r}{\\frac{d h(x)}{d x_{k}}=\\beta_{k}h(x)}\\end{array}$ ). An implication of this assumption is that the impact of the covariates does not change (in relative terms) with the progression of the spell of inaction.  \n\nOur information on the elapsed duration of inaction is grouped into quarterly intervals (while transitions can only be identified over a fixed interval of one quarter). Covariates are time-varying because they may change over the course of the inaction spell.16 A convenient way to deal with time-varying regressors is to assume that covariates remain constant during each interval and to split the duration into distinct episodes.17 To clarify this treatment lets assume that over the course of the spell $t=s+u$ covariates change at $s$ . Covariates remain $x_{1}$ during the first interval and change to $x_{2}$ during the second interval. In this case, the survival function, conditional on the history of the covariates $\\left(X_{t}\\right)$ can be written as  \n\n$$\nS_{j}(t\\mid X_{t})=[S_{0j}(s)]^{e^{x_{1}^{\\prime}\\beta_{j}}}\\frac{[S_{0j}(t)]^{e^{x_{2}^{\\prime}\\beta_{j}}}}{[S_{0j}(s)]^{e^{x_{2}^{\\prime}\\beta_{j}}}}.\n$$  \n\nA practical way to proceed is to split the data into quarterly episodes. Let $M=$ $m$ denote the occurrence of an exit in a given quarter, where $m$ is the realization of a discrete random inaction duration variable $M\\in(1,...,K)$ . Proceeding this way one can rewrite the survivor function as  \n\n$$\n\\small{S_{j}}(m\\mid X_{t})=\\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{m}[S_{0j}(k)]^{e^{x_{k}^{\\prime}\\beta_{j}}}}{\\prod_{k=2}^{m}[S_{0j}(k-1)]^{e^{x_{k}^{\\prime}\\beta_{j}}}}.\n$$  \n\nWith our sampling plan, where we collect the information of inaction duration for the fow of entrants into the inaction regime, the contribution of observation i for the likelihood function is simply  \n\n$$\nL(\\theta|t,r,X_{t})=\\prod_{m=1}^{K-1}\\prod_{j=1}^{2}[S_{j}(m-1|X_{t})-S_{j}(m)]^{\\delta_{m j}}[\\prod_{m=2}^{K}S(m|X_{t})]^{1-\\delta_{m}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\theta$ is a vector of parameters that include regression coefficients and baseline hazard parameters, and $\\delta_{m j}$ is an indicator that assumes the value 1 if the firm exits to destination $j$ during the $m^{t h}$ interval, and O otherwise. The indicator $\\begin{array}{r}{\\delta_{m}=\\sum_{j=1}^{2}\\delta_{m j}}\\end{array}$ identifies complete durations, so that $1-\\delta_{m}$ equals $^{1}$ for a censored observation. The contribution to the likelihood function from a censored observation is simply the product of the two specific survival terms $\\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{2}S_{j}(m)\\right)$ , that is, the probability of not exiting to either employment growth or employment decline.  \n\nEmpirical implementation of the model implies a definition of the no-adjustment regime.  There is no such obvious definition. For that reason four alternative criteria were used.18 These criteria are defined as follows:  \n\n· Absolute zero threshold on gross employment adjustment: the establishment is classified as inactive if, during the period, there were neither accessions nor separations to the establishment;   \n· Absolute zero threshold on net employment adjustment: the establishment is classified as inactive if, during the period, there was no change in the level of employment;   \n· Relative 10 percent threshold on net employment adjustment: the establishment is classified as inactive if, during the period, the change in the level of employment is less than 10 percent of the employment count at the beginning nf the nerind·  \n\n· Collective dismissal criterion: the establishment is classified as inactive whenever its employment level varies by less than two or less than five depending on whether the establishment employs fewer or more than fifty workers.19  \n\nThe first criterion corresponds to the strictest definition of inaction as applied to gross employment adjustment. This would be the most appropriate for investigating the importance of, say, fixed adjustment costs, as these imply that the same cost is borne independently of the number of individuals joining or leaving the establishment and of the size of the establishment itself. The second definition also takes an absolute criterion but applies on net employment change, ignoring the magnitude of gross flows that may be going on at the same level of employment. However, because data on separations do not permit us to distinguish between firings and other separations (temporary separations, voluntary quits, retirements, or deaths) a relative threshold (here set at 10 percent of the beginning-of-period count) - the third criterion - may also be adequate.  \n\nFinally, the fourth criterion listed follows the legal rule applying to the definition of collective dismissals, which are submitted to a number of obligations and imply considerably higher firing costs than those applying to individual dismissals.20  \n\nBeing able to use alternative definitions for the no-adjustment regime has the obvious advantage of permitting us to contrast the corresponding predictions and evaluate the sensitivity of the results to necessarily arbitrary thresholds.  \n\nFinally, there could remain an important sampling issue. We have been modeling, implicitly, the duration of an inaction spell. Repeated inaction episodes by the same establishment are frequently observed in the sample. This is adequate as long as we target the duration of representative spell of inaction. If, however, we are interested in the characterization of the adjustment of a representative establishment our sampling plan would be seriously fawed. The problem arrives from oversampling short spells in the current sampling plan. That is, establishments that adjust quickly would contribute with a large number of spells, whereas establishments that adjust sluggishly contribute with much smaller number of spells. Apart from the obvious impact on frequency of short durations, it is not clear how the sampling scheme may affect the inferences if one wants to consider the establishment as the unit of observation. Fortunately, the issue can easily be settled. Indeed, if for each establishment we simply consider the first spell of inaction, one can recover a representative sample at the establishment level. We also obtained the estimates for this subsample of data. Results are presented in the appendix but they do not differ qualitatively from those obtained with the sample representative of the inaction spell.  \n\n### 6.2 Estimation Results  \n\nResults of fitting the duration model with no covariates added for the four alternative definitions of the no-adjustment regime are depicted in Table 3.21  \n\nThe first result to notice is that, independently of how inaction is defined, the estimated values of the $\\lambda$ parameters of the Weibull distribution are low, indicating a low conditional probability of abandoning the no-adjustment regime. This is consistent with the evidence discussed previously that documented a substantial degree of inactivity and few quarterly transitions from inaction to action. The more demanding is the definition of inaction the lower is the baseline hazard. This finding is consistent with the fact that, conditional on entering more demanding inaction regimes, establishments are less likely to make a transition out.  \n\nAlthough low hazard rates are observed for the two exit modes - employment decline and expansion - they are higher in the decline destination case. However, this result should not be taken as evidence in favour of asymmetric adjustment costs because it is likely to be biased towards the employment decline margin as, for the most part, our sample corresponds to a downturn period in the Portuguese economy.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Employment Decline</td><td colspan=\"2\">Employment Expansion</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"4\">Gross Inaction (Absolute Zero Threshold)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>coefficient estimate</td><td>std error</td><td>coefficient estimate</td><td>std error</td></tr><tr><td>入</td><td>0.132 1.309</td><td>0.002 0.008</td><td>0.074 1.334</td><td>0.002 0.009</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>n Log likelihood</td><td></td><td>24075 -11257.9</td><td></td><td>24075 -8192.6</td></tr><tr><td>Net Inaction (Absolute Zero Threshold)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">coefficient</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>estimate</td><td>P4s error</td><td>coefficient estimate</td><td>std error</td></tr><tr><td>入</td><td>0.153</td><td>0.003</td><td>0.091</td><td>0.003</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td>1.307</td><td>0.012</td><td>1.331</td><td>0.015</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td></td><td>27510</td><td></td><td>27510</td></tr><tr><td>Log likelihood</td><td>Inaction (10 percent Threshold)</td><td>-13760.5</td><td></td><td>-10514.8</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.063</td><td>0.002</td><td>0.047</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td>1.174</td><td>0.018</td><td>1.155</td><td>0.012</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td></td><td>30752</td><td></td><td>30752</td></tr><tr><td>Log likelihood</td><td></td><td>-8764.1</td><td></td><td>-7005.9</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Inaction (Collective Dismissal Criterion) 入</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.102 1.177</td><td>0.003 0.014</td><td>0.058 1.220</td><td>0.002 0.017</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>32808</td><td></td><td>32809</td></tr><tr><td>n Log likelihood</td><td></td><td>-12470.9</td><td></td><td>-9096.8</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nTable 3: WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION DURATION MODEL.  \n\nIn all cases, the Weibull hazard function exhibits a positive duration dependence. The estimated $\\rho$ parameters are always greater than one and the notion of constant (or decreasing) hazard rates ( $\\rho=1$ ) is soundly rejected. This result has an interest of its own because we know that upward-sloping hazards in the context of \"time since last adjustment” are characteristic of nonconvex adjustment costs. A link between the slope of the hazard function and the structure of adjustment costs can be established under some assumptions. Cooper et al. (1999)  \n\nshow that a simple convex cost of adjustment model with positively serially correlated shocks and enough dispersion are inconsistent with upward-sloping hazard functions. The authors further generalize this result to other convex adjustment cost models. Nilsen and Schiantarelli (2003) also take upward-sloping hazards to be \"”consistent with presence of fixed adjustment costs that eventually dominate\" (p.1035). 22  \n\nHowever, in this very stylized model the estimated shape parameters (of the Weibull distribution) are barely above one. It is, in fact, well known from the duration analysis literature that failure to properly account for individual heterogeneity biases the results towards negative duration dependence.  \n\nControl for individual specific effects was, thus, implemented via the use of regression analysis. A set of covariates contemporaneous to the timing of events was added to the model. These covariates control for the size of the establishment (as measured by the log of total employment), the proportion of workers in the establishment with fixed-term contracts or part-time contracts, the gender and skill-structures of the workforce, and the proportion of workers with low tenure (less than three years) at the establishment. The age of the firm the establishment belongs to and the last employment regime (expansion or decline) the establishment visited before entering the current spell of inaction are also controlled for. Time and industry dummies are also included in the regression. Results are reported in Table 4.  \n\nThe estimated $\\rho$ parameters show that controlling for observed individual heterogeneity increases visibly the slope of the hazard function, for all inaction regime definitions. Remarkably, the estimated $\\rho$ parameters suggest that the shape of the hazard functions is now very similar across destination states. The fact that controlling for the magnitude of adjustment costs via a number of proxies included in the control set removes the asymmetry between employment expansion and decline is an indication that idyosincratic shocks are the major force behind the signs of asymetric adjustment in Table 3.  \n\nResults in Table 4 also show that for all the criteria but the third, larger frms are those facing the highest probability of exiting inaction (a one percent increase in total employment increases the hazard rate by 0.48 to 0.66 percent).  \n\nHowever, it is interesting to look more carefully at the estimated coefficient of the log of employment in the third specification. Remember that this estimate corresponds to the more demanding definition of action for variations of employment as large as 10 percent of the beginning-of-period count, establishments are still considered inactive according to this criterion. Put differently, it takes a net employment variation as large as 10 percent of the beginning-of-period count for an establishment to be considered as exiting the no-adjustment regime. What the estimate of the employment coefficient tells us is that larger establishments are the least likely to exit the no-adjustment regime so defined, although they are more likely to do so for alternative inaction definitions. This necessarily implies that most of the action we observed among larger establishments corresponds to relatively small adjustment episodes.  \n\nThe proportion of the workforce with fixed-term contracts was included as a regressor because costs of adjusting labor are lower if establishments employ temporary workers. It is also costumary to consider part-time work as a contingent or fexible form of work and for that reason we also control for the proportion of part-time workers.  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"5\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Employment Decline</td><td colspan=\"2\">Employment Expansion</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Inaction (Absolute Zero Threshold)</td><td></td><td></td><td>N = 24075</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Employment (log)</td><td>coefficient</td><td>std</td><td>coefficient</td><td>std</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"12\">Fixed-term contracts (% of total) Part-time workers (% of total) Gender (% of total) Skilled (% of total)</td><td>estimate</td><td>error</td><td>estimate</td><td>error</td></tr><tr><td>0.648</td><td>0.016</td><td>0.578</td><td>0.020</td></tr><tr><td>0.739</td><td>0.086</td><td>0.595</td><td>0.102</td></tr><tr><td>-0.132</td><td>0.154</td><td>-0.341</td><td>0.187</td></tr><tr><td>0.074</td><td>0.056</td><td>0.101</td><td>0.068</td></tr><tr><td>-0.743</td><td>0.146</td><td>-0.962</td><td>0.187</td></tr><tr><td>Low tenure (% of total)</td><td>1.524 0.116</td><td>2.474</td><td>0.113</td></tr><tr><td>Age of the firm</td><td>0.001 0.001</td><td>-0.010</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>From employment declining regime 0.029</td><td>0.032</td><td>0.170</td><td>0.040</td></tr><tr><td>0.096</td><td>0.005</td><td>0.052</td><td>0.003</td></tr><tr><td>p 1.894</td><td>0.021</td><td>1.913</td><td>0.025</td></tr><tr><td>Log likelihood</td><td></td><td>-6967.0</td><td></td><td>-5554.2</td></tr><tr><td>Net Inaction (Absolute Zero</td><td colspan=\"4\">Threshold)</td></tr><tr><td>Employment (log)</td><td>0.655</td><td>0.014</td><td>N = 27510 0.641</td><td>0.017</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-term contracts (% of total)</td><td>0.633</td><td>0.079</td><td>0.554</td><td>0.090</td></tr><tr><td>Part-time workers (% of total)</td><td>-0.133</td><td>0.142</td><td>-0.306</td><td>0.166</td></tr><tr><td>Gender (% of total)</td><td>0.093</td><td>0.051</td><td>0.093</td><td>0.060</td></tr><tr><td>Skilled (% of total)</td><td>-0.704</td><td>0.133</td><td>-0.731</td><td>0.163</td></tr><tr><td>Low tenure (% of total)</td><td>1.503</td><td>0.105</td><td>2.469</td><td>0.102</td></tr><tr><td>Age of the firm</td><td>0.001</td><td>0.001</td><td>-0.009</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>From employment declining regime</td><td>0.056</td><td>0.029</td><td>0.180</td><td>0.035</td></tr><tr><td>入</td><td>0.084</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.051</td><td>0.003</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td>1.957</td><td>0.020</td><td>1.995</td><td>0.023</td></tr><tr><td>Log likelihood</td><td></td><td>-8182.4</td><td></td><td>-6746.8</td></tr><tr><td>Inaction(10 percent Threshold) N: Employment (log)</td><td colspan=\"4\">二 ：30752</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-term contracts (% of total)</td><td>-0.126</td><td>0.016</td><td>-0.122</td><td>0.019</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1.187 0.370</td><td>0.091</td><td>0.719</td><td>0.106</td></tr><tr><td>Part-time workers (% of total)</td><td>0.172</td><td>0.163</td><td>0.040</td><td>0.181</td></tr><tr><td>Gender (% of total)</td><td>-0.668</td><td>0.072</td><td>0.080</td><td>0.081</td></tr><tr><td>Skilled (% of total)</td><td></td><td>0.172</td><td>-1.169</td><td>0.222</td></tr><tr><td>Low tenure (% of total)</td><td>1.137</td><td>0.121</td><td>2.039</td><td>0.115</td></tr><tr><td>Age of the firm</td><td>0.0001</td><td>0.002</td><td>-0.016</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>From employment declining regime</td><td>-0.030</td><td>0.041</td><td>0.354</td><td>0.048</td></tr><tr><td>入</td><td>0.029</td><td>0.002</td><td>0.020</td><td>0.001</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td>1.444</td><td>0.022</td><td>1.484</td><td>0.026</td></tr><tr><td>Log likelihood</td><td></td><td>-6727.4</td><td></td><td>-5301.3</td></tr><tr><td>Inaction (Collective</td><td colspan=\"4\">Dismissal Criterion) N= 32809</td></tr><tr><td>Employment (log)</td><td>0.531</td><td>0.015</td><td>0.481</td><td>0.019</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-term contracts (% of total)</td><td>1.141</td><td>0.091</td><td>0.796</td><td>0.103</td></tr><tr><td>Part-time workers (% of total)</td><td>0.711</td><td>0.194</td><td>0.062</td><td>0.227</td></tr><tr><td>Gender r (% of total)</td><td>0.108</td><td>0.061</td><td>-0.024</td><td>0.072</td></tr><tr><td>Skilled (% of total)</td><td>-0.399</td><td>0.167</td><td>-0.658</td><td>0.216</td></tr><tr><td>Low tenure (% of total)</td><td>1.262</td><td>0.133</td><td>2.639</td><td>0.126</td></tr><tr><td>Age of the firm</td><td>0.001</td><td>0.001</td><td>-0.008</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>From employment declining regime</td><td>0.124</td><td>0.033</td><td>0.014</td><td>0.040</td></tr><tr><td>入</td><td>0.033</td><td>0.002</td><td>0.025</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td>1.576</td><td>0.018</td><td>1.648</td><td>0.023</td></tr><tr><td>Log likelihood</td><td></td><td>-8552.6</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-6539.2</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n24 Table 4: REGRESSION MODEL ESTIMATES (WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION; UNIT OF OBSERVATION: SPELL OFINACTION).  \n\nResults indicate that the proportion of fixed-term contracts has, indeed, a strong positive effect on the establishments conditional probability of exiting inaction. Raising the proportion of temporary workers by one percentage point increases the conditional probability of exiting the inaction regime between 0.6 and 1.2 percent, depending on the regime definition and exit mode. The fact that the largest estimates for the coefficient of the fixed-term contract variable were obtained when the most demanding definitions of inaction (the 10 percent employment threshold and the collective dismissal criterion) are used indicates that fixed-term contracts are particularly instrumental in facilitating severe employment adjustment.  In turn, this indicates that, to some extent at least, they play the role of buffer-stocks. The estimated coefficient of fixed-term contracts is larger when establishments exit the inaction regime to enter the employment decline destination as compared to the alternative exit mode (employment expansion). Because all employers have the option to hire new workers on fixed-term contracts, the probability of exiting the inaction regime is less determined by the presence of a pool of temporary workers if they are moving to the expanding regime as compared to the declining regime. However, our results show that the effect is also positive when the destination regime is expansion. We take this as an indication that the hiring technology differs with the type of contract and learning is important. This would explain why firms that employ larger shares of temporary workers are more likely to move to the expanding regime.23  \n\nA positive sign for the coefficient of the fixed-term contract variable is direct evidence of the importance of adjustment costs. In fact, the presence of a pool of temporary workers makes it less costly for employers to fire some workers as they have the option to choose to fire those on temporary contracts. Our results indicate that this is actually what employers do. Irrespective of the employment regime the establishment is in, employers choose to initiate an adjustment spell with their temporary workforce - the rate of turnover of temporary workers is quite high and much higher than it is in the case of workers with permanent contracts (Table 5).  \n\nTable 5: QUARTERLY WORKER TURNOVER, BY TYPE OF CONTRACT .   \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Hiringrate</td><td>Separation rate</td><td>Worker Turnover</td></tr><tr><td>Expanding establishments</td><td>Permanent workers</td><td>6.1</td><td>1.4</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>Stableestablishments</td><td>Temporary workers Permanentworkers</td><td>34.2 0.5</td><td>7.6 0.7</td><td>41.8 1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Declining establishments</td><td>Temporary workers Permanentworkers</td><td>5.5 0.6</td><td>4.3 7.3</td><td>9.8 7.9</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\nThe rate of turnover of temporary workers is much higher than it is for permanent workers, specially on the hiring margin and for expanding establishments - this is consistent with the fact that in the Portuguese labor market 62 percent of all new contracts are temporary. On the separations side, the proportion of fixed-term contracts is smaller - 43 percent - but this is because we cannot isolate exits to retirement which disproportinally hit permanent workers. Still, for declining establishments the separation rate of temporary workers reaches 27.8 percent quarterly. Even for stable establishments the rate of turnover of temporary workers is five times greater than for permanent workers - 9.8 percent versus 1.2 percent. The fact that the hiring rate of temporary workers exceeds their separation rate in stable establishments is direct evidence of temporary contracts being used to screen workers for permanent positions even if they are also used as buffer-stocks.  \n\nFor the part-time variable, results indicate that part-time work has no statistically significant effect on the probability of adjusting employment. One could expect that establishments employing workers on a part-time basis would find it less costly to hire or fire as part-time contracts are usually easy to terminate. Yet, this is not necessarily true in Portugal where part-time contracts may be temporary or permanent and inherit all the features of their full-time equivalent. This may be the reason why the variable shows as not-significant.  \n\nTwo addtitional variables - Skilled and Low tenure - also have an adjustment cost interpretation as they control for the proportion of skilled workers and workers with tenure at below three years and adjustment costs are known to increase with the former and decrease with the latter. The results are consistent with this interpretation. The larger the proportion of skilled workers at the establishment the smaller is the probability that it moves to any other destination independently of how inaction is defined. This could result of more demanding hiring procedures for skilled workers but also of complementarities between general human capital and training in which case firing costs include a larger component of foregone profits. Equivalently, the larger the share of low-tenured workers at the establishment the more likely it is to exit inaction as these are less costly to fire both because they have received less job-specific training and because they are more likely to be on a trial period at the end of which bad matches are expected to be terminated.  \n\nIn an attempt to control for the conditions that initiated the current spell of inaction, a dummy variable that indicates whether employment decline or employment expansion preceeded the current inaction episode was also included. No clear pattern emerges from this exercise, suggesting that state dependence (generated by persistent product demand shocks, for example) does not appear to play an important role. Having said that, it is still true that units that entered the current inactivity spell from a declining episode are more likely to exit inaction independently of the exit mode.  \n\n## 7 Conclusions  \n\nIf adequate matched employer-employee longitudinal data are available, it is possible to assess the relative importance of convex and non-convex adjustment cost structures. Signs of both patterns of adjustment were investigated by checking the importance of extreme events (jumps in employment processes), their frequency and sequel. Unequivocal signs of discrete adjustment consistent with fixed adjustment costs were found at all these different levels. Large employment changes (larger than 10 percent of the establishments workforce) account for two-thirds of total job creation and destruction, and also of all gross employment fows. Inaction is pervasive with 75 percent of all units surveyed not changing the level of employment over one quarter, and 72 percent also not hiring or firing a single individual over the same period. Visits to any regime implying some sort of adjustment are frequently followed by a transition to the inaction regime, which emerges as highly resilient.  \n\nThe estimated hazard function for the probability of employment adjustment conditional on the duration of the inaction spell is upward sloping which is consistent with the presence of non-convexities in the technology of adjustment. Moreover, our results confirm that adjustment costs do influence the frequency of adjustment. The establishment-level proportion of temporary workers and low-tenure workers have a positive and significant impact on the conditional probability of adjustment. Conversely, the impact of the proportion of skilled workers is negative. These results survive changes in the definition of the inaction regime and are valid for the two exit modes (employment expansion and decline). Some signs of asymmetric adjustment were found - the baseline hazard is higher in the employment decline destination - although we cannot tell whether this is due to asymmetric adjustment costs or asymmetric shocks.  \n\n## References  \n\nABOWD, JUHN IVI., FAIRICK UURBEL AND FRANCIS NRAMARZ (I999), 1He Entry and Exit of Workers and the Growth of Employment: An Analysis of French Establishments, Review of Economics and Statistics, 81 170-187.   \nANDERSON, PATRICIA M.
